Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Pat McDonald," Good morning.  Nice quarter in the face of some challenges.  My first question relates to your '09 guidance, assuming SG&A remains roughly similar, tax rate roughly similar, all things being equal in that regard, your guidance appears to imply fairly minimal gross margin improvement relative to the second half of  '08.  Even given higher volumes, what would I expect maybe lower raw material costs, and what one would hope would be efficiency improvements at Power/Vac, can you kind of reconcile that for us please?"," That's a long reconciliation question, Fred.   As we have talked about on various conference calls, we have been improving all throughout the year.  As we always give in our guidance that says we are trying to get back to the best period of our peak before.  We're getting pretty close to that.  I don't know that we're going to see the step function changes that we have seen in the past over the quarters as it relates to operating efficiencies and productivity.  I think we will continue to see improvement, but it's not going be the size that we saw in this last fiscal year.",,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Pat McDonald," Then my followup relates to the sequential bookings decline.  Should we take that to indicate maybe a slowing in demand from the oil and gas sector, realizing your quote activity is still good?  Or is this kind of just quartertoquarter lumpiness?"," As we have talked about, we do have a lot of quartertoquarter lumpiness, especially with some of the size of the projects that we have.  I think we would be remiss to say that there are not some issues as it relates to the timing of jobs going forward in the future.  We do believe that our order input in the fourth quarter was impacted by the hurricane because not only were we down, but our customers were down and not placing orders at the same time.  As I think right now, we can probably say that our first quarter order input will exceed our fourth quarter order input.",,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Pat McDonald, Any way to quantify the impact of the hurricane on orders?, That one is almost impossible.,,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald," Good morning.  I was wondering on a historical perspective, do you have a sense what kind of treasure threshold price on oil that your customers are more apt to go forward with projects and what kind of threshold price on oil is when they start to pull back on orders?"," We don't have anything quantified.  The only thing I can allude to is there's been a lot of articles written and some of our customers have stated they never made a single investment decision based on $150-a-barrel oil.  I think the only thing that I can quantify that we have read was as it related to the tar sands projects, where they were looking at $45 to $55 to $60 a barrel made that economical.  Nothing else that we have tangible that relates to where people are making their investment decisions.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald, You don't participate in tar sands work do you?," Sure, we have a number of projects that we have supplied into the tar sands area, the pipelines, and coming back into the U.S.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald," I was not aware of that.  Just my followup, and I will get back into queue.  Remind me, did you expand your North Canton facility to kind of capitalize on transportationrelated projects?", We are in the process of expanding that right now.  That should be completed in our fiscal second quarter.,,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald," Could you just review that decision process and do you think it's a good one or bad one in light of municipal spending and also, if you will, potential infrastructure spending on the new administration.  I guess there’s a put and take kind of there with that decision."," I don't think I would second-guess the decision.  I think we need the space and high bay area, whether it's transportation or it's utility or it's oilbased.  Our deal is to supply solutions to the customers, and we need that type of overhead high bay crane space to do that with.",,,,,,
Ned Borland  Next Generation Equity Research,Pat McDonald," Just another followup on the orders question.  If we're looking, I know it's not a completely linear relationship with where oil is, but is there some sort of lag in terms of like where you see a precipitous drop in oil prices to when those translate into a lower absolute level of orders?  Is there any kind of relationship there?"," Ned, I don't have any graphs or statistics to give that.  Again, when we look at projects, they are typically three to fiveyear projects.  I think a lot of our customers, and I don't want to speak for them, but I think they're going to look to see that this is a spike down and there's going to be a movement back up.  I do believe that we have seen probably in the chemical area more of an immediate reaction in order input for what the chemical companies are seeing, because of who they supply their product to.  I think in the oil area, you are still talking three to five years on refining and production areas.",,,,,,
Ned Borland  Next Generation Equity Research,Pat McDonald," Is there any granularity you can give us on the utility business here, in terms of products or projects that may be coming down the pipe that may or may not get delayed because of credit financing or anything else?"," We don't have any in that area that we know of that are being delayed due to credit financing.  Not to say that there aren't some out there, but we have not seen any delay as a result of credit financing.",,,,,,
Craig Bell  SMH Capital,Don Madison," Good morning.  I wanted to followup on an earlier question with regards to some of the productivity there.  In past quarters, you talked about how many people you have been hiring and the ramp up there.  Number one, are you still hiring at a pretty good rate?  Number two, given the hiring that you have done over the past 1218 months, is that productivity starting to kick in with those newer workers?"," Looking at what we're doing today, our overall employees remain relatively flat over the last few months.  The hiring today is predominantly in replacement of individuals that leave, so our aggregate is basically flat.  That number is decreasing as well because of, as we talked in the past, our highest risk period with new hires is the first six months or so.  Actually, the highest risk is the first probably six weeks.  After about six to nine months, we do a great job of converting a new employee into a longterm employee.  Clearly, we have seen productivity improvements.  In a project business, it's hard to develop the same metrics you do in repetitive manufacturing.  I think, across the board, we're very comfortable that stability in the work force is improving and the benefits of that are beginning to be seen in our overall operating costs.",,,,,,
Craig Bell  SMH Capital,Pat McDonald," Thinking a little bit longer term, if you look at your business in terms of your growth prospects, looking forward do you think it's equally weighted among your industrial utility side or is it going to be more getting greater penetration on the utility side while growing the industrial is a little bit slower?", I would say that's probably a pretty good statement at the end.  We definitely want to increase our penetration into the utility market space and still continue to grow our industrial.,,,,,,
Craig Bell  SMH Capital,Pat McDonald, Did you say what your CapEx plans are for 2009?," No, we didn't.  We would expect it to rebound back to our average of $8 million to $10 million in CapEx spending in 2009.",,,,,,
Brent Thielman  D.A. Davidson,Don Madison," Good morning.  Congratulations on the quarter.  Don, I am hoping you can quantify the revenues through electric power products just from your industrial utilities and traction power customers."," Give me a second.  Looking at our fullyear fiscal 2008, utility market basically totaled around $172 million in total revenues, industrial market segment is around $400 million, traction power was just under $40 million, were basically electrical power products of the $611.5 million.  Then the balance of process control was $27.2 million, which is again municipal market.",,,,,,
Brent Thielman  D.A. Davidson,Pat McDonald," I guess just relevant to the Power/Vac business, can you guys talk a little bit about what you're seeing there just given its exposure to general manufacturing and commercial construction sectors?"," I would say if we have any area that we are seeing some volatility in the market, it would probably be the commercial market segment served by that area.  But, we continue to work with our partners over there, new opportunities and quotations in market segments that are still positive.  We are working hard to identify those and go capture those.",,,,,,
Brent Thielman  D.A. Davidson,Don Madison," One more, if I may.  Were there any particular project closeout benefits during the quarter?  Somewhat similar to what you saw in Q3?", Nothing in the same magnitude as Q3.,,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Don Madison," Good morning.  Good quarter, congratulations.  First question on process control segment.  Sales were up $2 million in the quarter to $7.3 million that recorded a loss of $560,000 versus $42,000 profit a year ago.  Can you just highlight what's responsible for the loss and how do you view that segment going forward?", The biggest impact occurred in the fourth quarter as basically our costs related to the claim we have with the City and County of San Francisco.  The cost basically of that unusual item continues to impact the results of the segment.,,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Don Madison, Do you anticipate that you have got additional cost structure that you are going to have to swing through there on that particular issue?," At this point in time, we have a judge ruling that is in our favor.  What is in front of us is going through any appeals processes that we anticipate.  That could impact, from a timetable standpoint, could impact throughout fiscal 2009.  But should not be to the same magnitude as we saw in 2008.",,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Don Madison," If I can just followup on a backlog question.  Can you break out domestic versus international in your backlog, and can you highlight anything in particular about your U.K. business progress?"," I do not have the breakout in front of me.  Basically, the international participation relative to last year is probably, my understanding, about flat.  Most of the backlog improvement we have seen in fiscal 2008 was due to strong domestic spending predominantly in domestic refining.  When you are looking at, we don't break out individual businesses, but I can report that our acquisition in the U.K. continues to perform very well.  We are very pleased with that acquisition.",,,,,,
Tom Spiro  Spiro Capital Management,Pat McDonald," Good morning.  Just a question about the backlog.  As a contractual matter, what are the circumstances in which a customer can either delay or cancel a project?"," Delay.  Typically, if the job is already on the floor, delays are in construction delays.  We work with the customer all the time in those types of delays.  If the job is not on the floor and we have not started that job, delays or deferrals or cancellations would be subject to cancellation clauses.",,,,,,
Tom Spiro  Spiro Capital Management,Pat McDonald," Do those clauses typically provide severe financial penalties or rather modest financial penalties?  I guess related is a pragmatic business question is when a significant customer asks to cancel, how do you respond?"," Most of our cancellation policies would be to make us whole.  That's also another reason why we do progress billings, especially if we are already into the project.  We have done progress billings to try to make sure that we are capturing the cash in a flow related to the cost of that project.",,,,,,
Tom Spiro  Spiro Capital Management,Pat McDonald," When you say make whole, you mean reimburse for costs expended or also for the profit opportunity now lost?", For the costs expended.,,,,,,
Tom Spiro  Spiro Capital Management,Pat McDonald," To the extent a project has not yet begun, I would imagine the costs expended are modest, not zero, but not particularly large."," Fairly modest, yes.  Engineering mostly.  Remember, as soon as we get a project, we start our engineering and then production may start sometime after that.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Don Madison, How much of your backlog is in the oil and gas sector?," We really don't have that statistic.  Again, it comes back to the standpoint we get orders directly from the end client, we get orders, purchase orders, that actually come through [ENC] firms.  So, even if you were to look into our backlog and tried to run a report, it's not easily ascertained.  When you are looking at overall aggregate, I would expect it to be similar to what we've seen in the revenue side. As we have talked in the past, probably anywhere from 60% to 80%, depending on the year, of our industrial segment comes from the oil and gas and oil and gas related projects, depending on how you want to characterize the oil and gas segment.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald," I might have missed this, apologize.  Based on what you characterized as the lumpiness in the Power/Vac business, how long until you think it achieves company like margin contribution?"," We had always said two to four quarters, we're still into 2009 where we thought we were going to get.  We have gotten faster than what we had anticipated.  There's no doubt about that.  I think we are within a couple quarters of being at a rate that is where we expect it to be when we acquired that Power/Vac product line.  The ramp is not nearly what it was a year ago.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Don Madison," Given the retrenchment in the oil market, has the bidding process become more competitive out there or are you not seeing any of that?"," First, I don't know that we have seen a retrenchment in the oil market yet.  We have seen lumpiness in orders.",,,,,,
John Franzreb  Sidoti and Company,Pat McDonald, So you say that the competition has been solid on pricing recently at least?," Again, our competition, the number of people who are bidding on jobs is growing.  To date, we have not seen any change in way people are bidding these jobs.",,,,,,
Tim Chatard  Sterling Capital,Don Madison," Your guidance for the next fiscal year implies an operating margin for the full year of roughly 7%.  Is there any, can you help me, is there any seasonality related to that as you move through the quarters of the 2009 fiscal year?"," There's no seasonality from a market standpoint.  There are continuous improvement projects that we've had, as well as the integration of the Power/Vac product line.  I would typically expect to see, and we expect to see, improvements in the second half over the first half.  It's from internal activities as opposed to the external market forces.",,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Pat McDonald," Thank you.  On the revenue loss in the quarter that was from the Hurricane Ike, can you outline if that revenue volume comes through in the first quarter here or was there a basic loss that would not be recoverable and did you experience any further fallout in October, which would be the first month of your new quarter here?"," Again, remember our business with the stackup of products and projects that we have.  There's no doubt the projects that impacted the fourth quarter are flowing through into the first quarter.  What still happens though, are the projects that were expecting those jobs to come off the floor now got delayed and pushed out a little bit.  It's going to probably take at least four months for us to get all of that flow back into the entire works to where we're back to where we think we're on top of the business again.",,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Pat McDonald," Then on the new activity, are there any particular areas that are creating new opportunities for you that you haven't been associated with in the past from the standpoint of R&D or innovation that's domestic or international in terms of project profile that's giving you opportunities that you haven't seen before?"," You know, we always talk about we will continue to invest in our R&D and we continue to invest in our R&D even today.  We will continue to invest higher than what other people are investing.  We have none that I would say are job specific, but we have a number of projects that we are working on right now that will be helping us in the future.",,,,,,
George Gaspar  Robert W. Baird,Don Madison," One last on the Power/Vac, the transfer out of Iowa.  In terms of, I know you made some comments about it, is that pretty much at a full operational point in Houston now relative to what GE was experiencing in Iowa?  How does that compare at this point in time?"," We completed moving all of the operations out of the GE facility around the end of February.  Since the end of February, what we have been doing is fine-tuning and refining our own internal processes.  That's what we're working on today.  As we spoke earlier, I think we will have accomplished what we anticipated and set forth with the acquisition no later than the second quarter, which is at this point, weeks away.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison, Couple quick ones.  The tax rate that you're assuming for next year would be what?," At this point in time, I would expect it to be no material change from the last couple of years.  Basically been around 35.5%.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison, Then the other question I had was related to some of the discussions on the San Francisco thing that was impacting process control.  Can you just remind me what that's about?," Basically, we had a project with the City of San Francisco that ran into some delays as a result of early on issues that our position came from delays due to the city itself as opposed to our operations.  That project is online, it has been successful.  The client is very happy with the project.  In fact, it's been operational now for about two years.  Basically, there was withholding of money from the contract by the city and we weren't successful in a mediation.  We had to end up going to court to basically obtain the monies that we felt were due to us.  That's where we are at this point in time.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison, Just some legal fees and so forth which are impacting the margins there?, Legal fees that have impacted the margin.  That is correct.,,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison, When can we see some resolution there?," Basically, we have a ruling from the court.  That ruling took place about late in the second quarter.  What we have been dealing with since then, and it will continue until early part of next year, is the appeals process.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison, What's the potential recovery if you're successful?," Potential recovery would be, at this point in time, in excess of our book value of $1.9 million.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison," Finally, the hurricane impact through the rest of the P&L, I know you called out the revenue and EPS impact, it's fair to assume probably there was some depressing effects on gross margin, if for no other reason than just slower throughput."," Basically, I would say that 99% of the impact was in the gross margin area as opposed to anything in the operating or SG&A area.",,,,,,
J.D. Padgett  Boston Company,Don Madison," So not a lot of expenses in operating expenses for clean up and hurricane preparation, all that kind of stuff?"," Basically, most of that was done by hourly personnel and resulted in manufacturing costs.  That's where the work was done and that's where the costs were incurred.",,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Pat McDonald," Just a few followups.  As it relates to orders and we've been talking about, you have seen an impact in the September quarter from the storm.  More relevant to the current economic situation, can you just give us a sense for trends in October and November with orders?", I think we're reasonably safe to say that orders for the first quarter of this fiscal year will exceed our fourth quarter of last fiscal year.  I think we're seeing a good trend.,,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Pat McDonald," Then you talked a little bit about the opportunity in mass transit, as it relates to the new administration and approval of billion of dollars for projects.  Can you quantify what the opportunity is for Powell in traction and process control, I guess?"," We tracked a fiveyear view of projects.  Those projects are ones that have been on the docket and looked at and once they potentially have federal funding, I think what we tried to address in our comments, is the overwhelming push by the public to say we want mass transit and we want you, government, to fund this, state governments to go fund this. I think, again, what I believe is the strength that we see over the fiveyear horizon says we're going to get our good fair share of that business because people really want to see funding done for mass transit projects.  I can't tell you how much that is, but I think it's going to be a very strong number for us.",,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Don Madison, Is it safe to assume that maybe traction power becomes a greater overall portion of your EPP mix?," Clearly as we go forward I would expect the opportunity to grow in the municipal markets, both in the transit as well as in the municipal markets for our intelligent transportation systems.  You are looking at opportunities that could easily exceed several hundred thousand dollars a year.  Realizing that it's still a competitive market, but we think that we're well positioned to get our fair share.",,,,,,
Fred Buonocore  CJS Securities,Don Madison," Finally, on working capital, how should we think about this as it relates to, and you continue to have strong orders, you're continuing to sort of finance these projects for your customers, at what point do things catch up to where your cash flow from operations is a source of cash as opposed to use."," At this point in time, I think that the full year 2009 will result in a source of cash.  When you are looking at the first quarter, the first quarter will likely continue to be a use.  But at this point in time, I think that we will turn the corner and start seeing positive cash flows predominantly coming from reductions in working capital relative to revenue around midyear.",,,,,,
Stefan Mykytiuk,Don Madison," Good morning.  Just a followup on Fred's questions about the orders.  Given what's going on in the world, seems like a lot of refiners and chemical companies been cutting back their CapEx.  So, where are you seeing the strength in this December quarter for orders?  What kind of end markets are still strong?"," The orders activity we have seen thus far in the first quarter continue to be representative of historical markets.  It continues to have a strong impact from the oil and gas segment, both domestically as well as internationally.  That comes back to, from the beginning, we really have not seen any, what I would call noticeable change in activity in the marketplace from and order activity standpoint.",,,,,,
Brent Thielman  D.A. Davidson,Pat McDonald, One quick one.  Just give us a quick update on the [Makita] contract and what's remaining in backlog.," The project is going well.  What's remaining in backlog, I don't have that number in front of me.  I would think it's still a fairly substantial number that is out there yet to go.",,,,,,
Brent Thielman  D.A. Davidson,Pat McDonald," Relative to the offshore market, any sort of update that are you still seeing good activity in that particular oil and gas area?"," We are seeing good activity in it and good dialogue and discussions with our customers.  I think that's going to be again another strong point in the future.  As we look at pipelines and offshore platforms, as people look to find energy sources from other areas, the offshore plays a big role for us in the future.  Because it is a less costly extraction process than other things like the tar sands. By congress allowing more offshore drilling to begin, I think that's going to bode well for us in the future.",,,,,,
Craig Bell  SMH Capital,Pat McDonald," I wanted to circle back on the backlog and the new orders.  Just wondering between the hurricane, obviously, you guys were shut down, you couldn't take orders and many clients were also impacted.  Do you think that had a significant impact on new orders and backlog in the quarter or is it more just regular lumpiness?"," There was some impact.  There's no way we can quantify it.  Again, we were down, we were not able to take orders and we know all of our customers, especially in the oil area around Houston, were working to get their facilities back up online.",,,,,,
Craig Bell  SMH Capital,Pat McDonald, Have you seen any business that's come out of the impact from the hurricane?  Just sort of repair work that needed to be done?," We have seen some in our service business.  There's no doubt about that.  I think every time there's a hurricane, just as we talked about how we prepare.  Our customers are doing a better job to prepare themselves.  Especially in the oil and gas, they are putting all their substations up in the air.  Our facilities, our control rooms and things are lifted up into the air.  So, they're getting a lot smarter about the storm surge to make sure that they aren't cut down in their electrical area as a result of storms.",,,,,,
