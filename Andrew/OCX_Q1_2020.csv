Bruce Jackson,Ronald Andrews," So with DetermaIO, there’s clearly a potential here for this test. You’ve got it available [indiscernible] test. Can you tell us a little bit about some of the stuff you need to go through in order to make this available as a clinical use test, and then when could that happen?"," Great question. I’m going to do the first part. Then I’m going to turn it over Dr. Ross because he’s close to this. Padma and Dr. Ross have been in contact with CMS and we’ve gotten some really solid input from them. Today, we have a 71-patient study in lung. Soon, ASCO when they release their data – they’re going to release a paper that MD Anderson has written and published that will be released at ASCO. That will be another 55 patients. We believe that we’re going to need another round of patients that will add to the statistical power. Doug, you want to walk us through how we might get that and what options we might have to accelerate sort of the statistical powering of our tests, using some clinical trial samples that have already been run, but either the trial failed or they didn’t get the outcome they wanted.",,,,,,
Keay Nakae,Ronald Andrews," Thanks. Mitch, what kind of – I guess two parts to this question. What kind of pricing are you currently getting for RX and what percent of the test that you run are you actually getting payment for?"," So to date we have build – we have holding all the CMS payments because we need a final price before we do that. So somewhere between now and June 13, when we begin on the 14, we will get that price and we’ll be able to submit those. And as we’ve discussed publicly, we really had had a really powerful dossier that Padma and team put together. We believe that because of the end of life cost in lung cancer that we have a really good support for our $4,000 asking price. As I said, publicly I think that sometimes you might as well hit the easy button and they’ll crosswalk it to the test that it’s equal, if you will, in terms of the endpoint and that is Genomic Health OncoCyte DX, same endpoint but different disease and that is about $3,800 today. But in the private pay world we have submitted our bills at our list price. And to date, the couple that we’ve had that were private payers, keep in mind, over 70% are CMS eligible patients. So the few that we’ve had that were private pay, they have accepted our list price. But to be honest, Keay, that’s not unusual in the early days of a new launch like this. They are accepted because the patient – because of the high deductible plan the patient ends up having to pay a good bit of that. And so we will get recognized by these payers. And if the physician that orders it does a good justification, we will indeed get paid but it won’t be at the list price. Ultimately when CMS gives us our price, we’ll use that as leverage to go in and start negotiating our price at these private payers. We prefer not to begin that until – just historically, people that go before CMS tend to not always get the best value. It’s better to fight for with a really powerful dossier the price you want and then use that as your benchmark for private payers. And so that is our strategy.",,,,,,
Keay Nakae,Ronald Andrews," Okay, great. And then for IO, what would be either the very pushback from pharma or what are they – you obviously have got some great results here. What are they most complementary about using the test in their study?"," I’m going to let Doug add because he’s very close to this in the discussion of pharma. I think they already have a lot of studies with PD-L1 which as you know Merck did a great job of using PD-L1 to get everybody on the drug, but we know that only about 40% to 45% of the patients that are deemed as potentially responders by PD-L1 actually respond. So you have a high percentage of the patients that go on the drug that don’t get a response, healthcare pays the bill and that patient is exposed to an immune therapy that basically can begin to increase the number of autoimmune diseases in our industry which would be bad as well. So I think for us, the idea – at least pharma is that while PD-L1 gets everybody in, what we are positioning as we’re discriminating a marker that can identify sustained response. So not only can we predict who should be in, we can also predict who should not be in. And so that’s one of the headwinds. It’s just overcoming the momentum that PD-L1 already has in these trials, but there are a number of companies chasing Merck that would love to have a marker that would identify patient populations that would allow them new niches, if you will, in the world. So, Doug, any comments on the back of what I’ve just said?",,,,,,
Keay Nakae,Ronald Andrews,Great. And then just a final question on sales force headcount. Where are you now and where might you be around the beginning of the year with perhaps a commercial IO as well as DX?," Yes. So because IO today is really focused in pharma, we have a small team including myself that actually – and Doug that are going after the pharma opportunities based on our history and knowledge of the people there and we’ve got a lot of experience there. Our commercial team selling RX today is six folks with a leader. We chose the high incident rate areas that we believe we could reach that would give us some immediate upswing. The idea has always been that once we grow those current territories to a certain level, we would add another round of reps. And the goal is to responsibly add reps without impacting cash burn. So the idea would be to try to build reps up until they’re covering their cost and adding to the accretion to the business. And then we would go use that accretion to go build out the next round of sales force. Should we get an early immune-oncology CMS approval which we aren’t committing to, but should that happen, I reserve the right to come back and change that. But right now, that’s the plan.",,,,,,
Paul Knight,Ronald Andrews," Thank you. Ronnie, can you talk about the highlights of the DetermaDx paper at ATS 2020 in terms of – kind of your highlights I guess? I know it’s centered around test versus biopsy, but still it’s since recent would love to hear your thought on it?"," Yes, sure. And I think it was – DetermaRx was at the ATS and I think Padma really – because she’s very close to this, I’d like to her to comment on that. But we were very excited about that. And then when obviously the association decided to cancel and just put everything online, we had hoped to have a podium, a presentation. Those always go over well and they get – you get video, you can in this date and time you can use social media to promote that. But we didn’t get that opportunity. But Padma, do you want to give some color commentary on the ATS poster?",,,,,,
Paul Knight,Ronald Andrews," The last question I have Ronnie is on that paper, what Lung-RADS classification were these samples?"," I’m going to ask – Lyndal, you want to answer that?",,,,,,
Paul Knight,Doug Ross,Okay. Congratulations.," Sorry, guys. This is Doug. Just a reminder that this is a combination of benign and tumor. Only a fraction of them actually turn out to be tumor. And so that cohort is designed to inform whether or not we biopsy a nodule which it could be benign or tumor to determine whether or not it is in fact tumor. So the clinical indication is for use of invasive biopsy procedures and obstructing the use of invasive biopsy procedures.",,,,,,
Steven Mah,Ronald Andrews," Yes, likewise. Maybe just to follow up on Tom’s question on RX on volumes and let’s not get specific, but I would expect that lung cancer surgeries will be pretty resilient as compared to other elective procedures and I just want to get a sense that do you guys expect a gradual ramp back up in terms of lung cancer surgeries or an immediate uptake based on the lung cancer surgery backlog and maybe can you give us a sense of how things have changed from maybe March to maybe late April, May?"," Yes. Steve, it’s a great question and I’m going to give you probably more detail than you want on this. So just to be careful and I’ll let Padma chime in and add color commentary. But what we see is different areas of the country impacted differently and we chose regions of the country for our initial six reps to go concur based on high value or high volume incident rates of lung cancer with assertive thoracic surgeons that we knew were seeing a large number of patients. Some of those surgeries and some of those really account our own states that are opening back up, others are not. And I’m going to give you just anecdotally here locally in Orange Country because I’m very active in the local hospital community here. We had three hospitals who despite the volume of COVID cases still elected to save ventilators and save anesthesiology for a potential upswing in the outbreak. And so they basically stopped anything that was not an urgent surgery, so anything deemed elective. Now, you and I would agree that early stage lung cancer is traditionally not elective. In fact, I’ve seen statistics where somewhere around 8% to 10% increase in potential recurrence every month an early stage lung cancer patient goes without surgery. So we do expect to see those surgeries to pick back up just because as you say they’re really not elective. These surgeries are important for these patients but a lot of it has less to do with the patient situation and a lot to do with availability of surgical suites. So Padma, any other color you’d like to add to that?",,,,,,
Steven Mah,Ronald Andrews," Okay, great. Yes, that’s great color. And maybe just one more question. On your pharma services business, again kind of the same line of questioning, how COVID-19 shutdowns affected your pharma customers? And again, do you expect a gradual recovery or short ramp back up as research and academic labs begin to open up?"," Yes, this is one where I’ll recruit Dr. Ross or Dr. Hesterberg as well, but it’s interesting because right out of the gate the first couple of weeks, a lot of the engagement we had with the pharma companies themselves went down significantly in the quiet. And obviously after a few weeks, things began to open back up and we began to reengage. What we do know is just from that feedback from the industry and my role at ASCO, we are hearing that there has been a reluctance of patients to go to the hospital to be treated and thus the number of patients that would normally get diagnosed and potentially put on a trial has slowed. But what we do know is the engagement with pharma and the interest in what we’re doing is starting to pick back up. When those patients will actually show up and start begin enrolling in various trials is really still up for grabs I think, but we don’t have really direct insight to that expect through our pharma partners. But Dr. Ross, any color commentary you want to add on that?",,,,,,
Thomas Flaten,Mitch Levine," Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mitch, a quick question for you. With some of the cost reductions that you’ve put in place and the raise that you recently did, could you comment on your cash runway, cash burn rate?"," Yes, Thomas, thanks for the question. We expect to burn just over 5 million a quarter and that’s what we have been doing. Those are our expectations. And expect to continue that rate for the course of the year.",,,,,,
Thomas Flaten,Ronald Andrews,And then I was wondering if you guys would be willing to share any numbers around test volumes that you’ve seen since the launch of RX? I know because of the accounting principles we’re probably not going to see it reflected accurately in the numbers.," Yes. Thomas, we had – we wanted to begin to give guidance on that at this quarter and obviously we didn’t expect the COVID pandemic. It’s a little hard to give you a real good trajectory given that we just now are starting to ramp back up even though we saw steady flow of connections to physicians and samples came in during the COVID, the worst part of that pandemic. Today, we’re just now starting to engage a lot of the places we brought on board during the virtual onboarding and we’re starting to see physicians start to order. Our goal obviously is to ramp up every site and have ordering physicians at every site. We do expect that will take a little while once we are able to engage them physically. We want to go behind these onboarding activities and we want to be able to then recruit the actual physicians within those sites that are ready to order and get them and encourage them to order. So today, we gave the number 17 patients that we had actually identified as positive that had changed their course of therapy. So that number we were public with today. So if you assume that about somewhere around 20% to 30% of the patient population that we see will be positive, you can kind of get to a number and that number is only reflective of what we were able to do during the pandemic. What I committed to everyone and we’ll continue to reiterate is at the end of Q2, once we have a much greater understanding of how – what the long-term impact of COVID is going to be, we will give you sort of a target for the end of the year in terms of what patient population that we think we can touch.",,,,,,
Thomas Flaten,Ronald Andrews,That’s great. And then just one final one from me. Would you mind detailing or providing a little bit more detail around the publication plan for DetermaDx given how central that is to your submission timing for CMS?," Yes, happy to do that. Padma’s on the call and – I think the reason I invite our whole team is because we have an amazing team of experts that have been around in this space. So Padma, you’ve got – and Lyndal – I will just – we’re in virtual, Padma, so I apologize [indiscernible] Lyndal and Padma are going to tag team it. So Lyndal, you want to go first in terms of the manuscript and then Padma maybe comment on CMS. Lyndal?",,,,,,
