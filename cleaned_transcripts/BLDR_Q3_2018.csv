Alex Rygiel,Peter Jackson,Thank you. Just one quick question. Was there an extra sales day in the fourth quarter 2017?,Yes. I think that's the – fourth quarter is when we have our mismatch again this year.
Jay McCanless,M. Chad Crow," The first question I had, and just going back to great numbers on the manufacturing product side and in terms of the adoption of panelization and things like that, I've always felt like the sticking point there wasn't the homebuilders but actually the framing subs. Can you talk about what types of discussions you're having with them and are some of them finally giving in to panelization and other type of projects because they just can't get the labor anymore?"," Yeah. I think that's accurate. We are seeing more and more interest and more and more discussions with builders who historically have not used it, deciding now is the time to start trying it."
Jay McCanless,M. Chad Crow," And then, just wanted to ask also, with the sharp drop in prices over the last couple of months, is this something where there is an inventory problem inside the industry that's working itself out? Or is this more dislocation from people being worried about whether housing starts keep growing. What do you guys think has caused this sharp decline over the last two months?"," To some degree, I almost feel like we're victims of our own actions. I think as prices start to fall, everybody gets a little more cautious on buying. And so, all of a sudden, everybody's gone from, oh, I've got to buy to cover my position because prices are rising, to sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see where things stop falling. And so, in a sense, we all start acting in concert and it ends up – and I think that's part of the problem. And I think at some point folks are going to say this thing's hit bottom and everybody is going to start buying again, and we all know what that's going to mean. It's going to mean prices are going to go up. So I think it's a lesser concern about – I mean there's seasonality involved for sure. But I think it's less a concern of the overall health of housing, as it is just people just trying to guess when the bottom is going to be."
Jay McCanless,M. Chad Crow," Good. And then the last one I had, the 3% growth you guys registered in single-family sales outpaced the national numbers for the third quarter. Can you talk about – I mean, and then that's something I know you guys typically do on a routine basis, but can you talk about, as we move into 2019 and if starts are flat or a little bit softer than people expect, do you think the value-add products that you have out there and some of the things you're going to be introducing will allow you to keep growing faster than the market?"," Certainly, yeah, that's the plan. And I think, as I said earlier, I don't see all of a sudden having to go out of labor to build houses. And so I think that's going to continue to be an issue for the builders, and I think the builders are going to continue to look for ways to more efficiently build homes, build homes more quickly. So, yes, I think the investment we're making in the value-added products will allow us to grow faster than whatever the market is giving us."
John Allen Baugh,M. Chad Crow," I had a little higher-level question and it relates to the shift of value-adds in manufactured and certainly commodities moved all over the place and they impact margins when they do. But when you think, Chad or Peter, about what – the pace you're on of shifting your mix, what overall impact that's having to either gross margin or EBITDA? Any sense of how you're moving the needle through time? I'd love to just get a sense of that."," That's a good question when you try to drown out all the other noise that's going on. I think if we execute on our strategic plan over the next few years of expanding value-add on the company as a whole, gosh, I could see by the end of say 2021 or so kind of a permanent improvement of 40 basis points or so in our gross margin would be, I guess, a best guess off the top of my head."
John Allen Baugh,M. Chad Crow," Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we saw housing starts in 2019, say, flat or maybe even slightly down, I'm assuming your earnings might get impacted if that played out. But I'm curious as to how your free cash flow might react. And I realize you're not giving 2019 guidance, and that ties into the working capital question, which I know ties in the commodity price changes and all those things. But, again, from a very high level, I'm trying to think about the leverage targets you have in time, and obviously if EBITDA goes down, that, everything being equal, raises leverage, but I'm curious about the free cash flow component."," Yeah. Go ahead, Peter."
John Allen Baugh,M. Chad Crow," So, Peter, just to be clear, that would decline, right? Yeah. Go ahead."," Yeah. In that type of environment, the cash flow would not be impacted as much as you might think because you do have the offset of working capital less taxes. And if things look like they're slowing down, we may delay some of the CapEx too. And so it's a bit of a silver lining in the business we're in. We do, as business is growing, use up a lot of cash and working capital and investing in things like that. But as things slow, we're able to release some of those items. So the net change in cash flow can be fairly minimal."
John Allen Baugh,Peter Jackson," Correct. And then my last question then, and this sort of came up earlier, but if we had a no-inflation scenario that's not impacting your revenues, what kind of organic growth, real growth, does it take to leverage SG&A even just a little bit?"," Well, I think our guide historically has been that we think that there's about a 70% variable component of SG&A. I think that's fairly true. I think that – we're still very confident in the market. We think there's still a lot of opportunity there for us to grow. So we definitely don't see the existing market or the market we're looking at day-in day-out is a cause for concern, a cause for aggressive action to make sure we're getting in front of it. I realize that folks on the Street look at a decline of growth from 9% to mid-single digits as something well-nigh the apocalypse, but it still feels like a pretty healthy market for us. We're still feeling pretty good about our opportunities. So I think that we will continue to deliver along the lines of what we've been talking about over the past few quarters in terms of incrementals on working capital, commodities, SG&A. I think all those things are still holding true."
Kathryn Ingram Thompson,M. Chad Crow," Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. I've noticed a lot of focus on lumber, but if we could shift focus to more gypsum roofing and insulation products. It'd be helpful to understand what trends you're seeing there, particularly since you've had a few mid-year price increases in some of those categories, which is a little more – mid-year price increases are a little bit more unusual. But give your perspective on trends and what you're seeing in those types of products and if you have any thoughts going into 2019. Thank you."," Well, for us, it's a very small piece of our business, I would say, from a sales perspective. That's where we do a lot of our commercial and multi-family business, and so that's obviously been down somewhat for us. From a gross margin perspective, been relatively flat year-over-year. I would expect to see a little uptick in the overall business in those categories next year if we do start to see a little bit of a rebound in the multi-family side of things for us."
Kathryn Ingram Thompson,M. Chad Crow,And that's on pricing? I was really kind of focusing on just kind of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint for those categories. Are you saying it's been flattish from a pricing standpoint for you?," Oh, no. Sorry. That was from a gross margin standpoint. So what price increases we have gotten, we've done a good job of getting those passed on."
Kathryn Ingram Thompson,M. Chad Crow," Okay. And just really focusing, once again circling back on the value-added manufactured products. And as you continue to develop this more and build momentum in that business, what types of customers – and really, kind of want to get a better sense of regions and types of projects you're seeing greater acceptance. And where do you think that business can be, not just next year, but two to three years from now as a percentage of your total sales?"," Well, we see acceptance across all our single-family homebuilder categories, and certainly the multi-family side are big users. So those products aren't limited to national builders or custom builders. There's pretty good acceptance across all categories. As far as regions go, historically, components have been readily accepted in the Northeast, in the Northwest, a little less so in the South where you've traditionally had more labor availability, but that's changed. Those dynamics are changing. And so we're certainly seeing more acceptance in the Southern part of the country than we've had in the past. From a mix standpoint, gosh, we're going to continue to push. And anything we can do to drive down the pure commodity distribution business and expand the value-add side of the business, I think, gosh, we said it as a percent of sales that we can move that mix 1% to 2% a year that would be pretty successful in my mind."
Kathryn Ingram Thompson,Peter Jackson," Do you have happen to have handy or off top of your head, when you look at the regions like the Southeast, which admittedly has been slower in acceptance, what that is as a percentage of your Southeastern sales, say, three to four years ago where it is today or is there maybe even a growth rate associated with that region, just to give a perspective on growth?"," Not handy. No. We can try and look forward to having some of that information in the future, but that's not something we've done in the past."
Keith Hughes,M. Chad Crow," Yeah. Two questions. One a bigger picture on multi-family. Are you starting to see some signs of multi-family, which has nationwide been in a little bit of a downturn here, start to pull back up for 2019?"," It does feel like we may have hit kind of the low point. We'll see a lot of that's market-by-market as well. But I'm hopeful we've hit kind of the low point on that. We're investing a lot in our multi-family team and really trying to serve the multi-family business more from a roof truss and floor truss perspective primarily. And so, time will tell, but hopefully we're going to start to see some upside there."
Keith Hughes,Peter Jackson," Okay. And two, there was a comment on interest expense being $95 million to $100 million, I think, for 2018. You're at $85 million year-to-date. I know you're paying down debt, but that's a pretty drastic reduction on a quarterly basis. I guess what's causing that? What are we looking at for the fourth quarter?"," Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I have a change in profile there. I think that there's a – when we look at the interest that we're incurring throughout the year, we incur more when we have our seasonal borrowing, which is coming down pretty rapidly right now. So I think, on a profile basis, our fourth quarter has relatively lower interest."
Keith Hughes,Peter Jackson,Okay. So it's going to be...,And nothing special is going on is the short answer.
Keith Hughes,Peter Jackson," Okay. So it's going to be $10 million to $15 million, is that kind of what we're looking at for the fourth quarter?"," I think that's the squeeze, yeah."
Kurt Yinger,M. Chad Crow," Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And I know it's late, so I'll just stick with one. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you think about geographies to add new manufactured components capacity in 2019 and going forward, and if there's any one or two geographies that are particularly compelling at this point."," Well, it's largely the Western part of the country where we feel like we're under-represented in our footprint. I'd rather not disclose which particular markets we're talking about this for competitive reasons. But I would say a lot of it's largely the legacy ProBuild footprint where those products were under-represented."
Kurt Yinger,Peter Jackson,Great. Thank you very much.," So the one point I want to clarify to Alex's question earlier about the days, he asked the question and I was agreeing that we have a difference in days, but I've been pointed out that we think he might have said less days. It's actually more days in the fourth quarter. In 2018, we lost a day of sales in Q1, and we'll gain a day in Q4, full-year flat. So, just a clarifying point."
Matt McCall,M. Chad Crow," So, maybe talk about pricing for a second. You mentioned some pricing tools. The 11 points of price is actually a little better than I think you expected in the quarter, definitely better than we modeled. And then the Q4 guide even seems a tad better than we had expected. So, are the pricing tools helping there? Is there something else that's going on? Is there any change, or is this just kind of where you thought it would be?"," Well, certainly the commodity prices moving in our favor helped. We saw margin improvement in all our value-add categories this quarter, which didn't surprise me. And the pricing tool we've piloted in three or four markets and we've seen some positive results. It's really a tool we've built to make it easier and quicker for GMs to do pricing, puts a little more discipline around it, provides us better exception reporting when pricing goes outside of some predetermined levels that we set and does some customer stratification for us. So it's really just adding a level of sophistication. And we have seen some good results and we're working towards rolling that out more next year. So I would say maybe I was slightly surprised by the overall improvement in gross margin, but it certainly wasn't out of what was in the realm of expectation."
Matt McCall,M. Chad Crow," Okay. Okay. As we look out in the next year and we think about the impact of incrementally lower lumber prices and trying to keep in mind how to model that, what's the updated thought, given some of the things you just said, on the decremental margin that you'll face from falling lumber?"," I don't even want to get into speculating that because I think to try to waste time right now trying to assume that prices are going to be where they are today all the way through next year, I just don't think that's a useful – it's not a good use of our time. I think I feel pretty good we're going to hold gross margins, improve gross margins next year. Commodities will be what they're going to be, and that's part of the business and we deal with it. And I think we did a great job this year dealing with extreme volatility, and we're going to continue to execute no matter what it brings. So we really haven't even run numbers yet because I just don't think the prices are going to stay where they are."
Matt McCall,Peter Jackson," Sure. Okay. That's fair. And I guess one last one. Peter, in the past, we've talked about some internal working capital initiatives. Working capital is a little better than we thought and lumber is likely going to help that. But what's the way to think about working capital? I know there was a question earlier about the impact of falling lumber and you're going to have a tailwind. But how do we think about it given maybe some of those initiatives on top of falling lumber as we move out into next year?"," Yeah. Fair question. I think that the work that we've done around working capital is more a matter of structural discipline and a continuing focus on it to make sure that it never gets out of control, and we're still in that 9% to 10% range. I think that there are some specific examples that I can give you of success stories on a location-by-location basis. The dynamics that I think is challenging for the quarterly metric or for the ongoing metric is the in-month ups and downs, the nature of what we hold for our customers, the nature of how we have product on the ground at different valuations for projects or specific ordering profiles. It's a little bit harder to point to a specific quarter or a trend move, but I do see the benefits of the organization in what we do on a location-by-location basis by that focus. And I'm not quite ready to change our guide on that, but I think it will be part of the tailwind that we see coming to the back end of this year. And as we look at the year-over-year comps for working capital use into 2019, I think we'll see it as well. It's going to be caught up in that deflation number though based on where we are right now."
Matthew Bouley,M. Chad Crow," I wanted to follow up around the questions on the commodity price. And I think you just mentioned that you guys are confident around kind of a rebound there. So, just if we are in, I guess, this stable single-family volume environment here, I think you just mentioned 4% to 5% next year, and given housing is a big driver of lumber demand and you guys are obviously closer to the market and normal isn't really a word that you can necessarily apply to lumber, but at this point what's kind of your best guess, given supply and demand, around what kind of a normalized lumber price should look like into next year? Thank you"," Oh, gosh. If I had to guess, I would say next year will be volatile as well. Probably not to the degree we saw this year. And I wouldn't be surprised if, by the time we end next year, average prices for 2019 are maybe 20% lower than they were on average this year. So I think we'll see inflation. I think we'll see volatility. But I would be surprised if average prices in total for the year are as high as 2018, but I still think they would be some pretty healthy levels. And again, that's obviously just – that's just a guess at this point."
Matthew Bouley,Peter Jackson," Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then, on the manufactured products business, the 21% growth, I think I heard you say double-digit on volume. Is there any finer point you can put on that volume versus price there? Because it's just – obviously, given what you mentioned around the market growth next year, I think it would just be helpful to understand your growth relative to the market and so how we can think about that into 2019? Thank you."," So, I mean, we don't have any real market information that we feel comfortable banging up against. I mean, I think that when we talk about single-family, we have some high-level starts numbers, even that's tough given the changing size and profile of the homes that we sell into. We feel very good about our performance. We think we're at or above market. We think we're holding or gaining share as far as value add goes. Yeah, there's a good chunk of commodity inflation and pricing change in the number this year, but we're still solidly in the double digits for growth in the manufactured products, I think still in that double-digit range for consolidated value add, so clearly market share being taken in that space. I think it's consistent both with the investments we're making as well as the market adoption of that sort of labor-saving service that we provide in that space. So we feel like that is very healthy and I think consistent that we've seen pretty much all year and through last year. So we feel very, very good about the investments we've made and our continuing commitment to that space. We think our customers like it and it continues to get great traction."
Michael Dahl,Peter Jackson," First question relates to just the environment. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces, particularly around the lumber but also with some of these slower builder order trends of late. So, strong fourth quarter guidance. I know it's early but I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary even directionally on what you expect from 2019. Is the magnitude of decline in lumber prices and this relatively slower growth such that it will be, I guess, difficult to grow EBITDA in 2019? Or can you talk about whether you expect growth next year?"," Yeah, you're right. There are a lot of moving pieces right now and it seems like a lot of things are kind of in flux. But we do still feel like overall housing demand will grow, single-family demand will grow next year. Best guess now, maybe single family is up 4%, 5%. Time will tell, obviously. But it still feels like more of a pause, a speed bump, whatever you want to call it. So I would say sitting here today I expect single family to be up. Commodity prices. It's funny, two quarters ago we were talking about how high prices were and were we going to update our long-term forecast because what we've thrown out there would be a slam dunk at those prices. And now we're talking about are prices going to stay where they are today. I think what we can all agree is prices aren't going to stay where they are. And I think when I responded to the question two quarters ago, I said, yeah, that would be great but we all known prices won't stay where they are, commodity lumber prices, they just don't, they never do. So I would fully expect to see commodity price inflation. From where we are today, it's starting to feel like we've hit some lows. And we'll be dealing with some of the same things we've dealt with last year, transportation issues, things like that. So, yes, if commodity prices stayed where they were today all the way through next year, that'd be a pretty big headwind, but I really don't anticipate that's going to happen. And we're closing out a year that was probably the most volatile ever in commodity prices and I think we managed through it really well and we're producing a hell of a year. And so we'll deal with whatever cards are dealt us next year, but I would fully expect to see some inflation between now and then as we work through the rest of next year."
Michael Dahl,Peter Jackson,Got it. Yeah. It's been pretty wild.,Yeah.
Michael Dahl,Peter Jackson," The second question, and either you or maybe Peter can take this, sticking with the commodity price inflation but asking more from a working cap standpoint. Can you quantify how much of a headwind you expect it to be to your 2018 results? And if lumber prices were sitting where they're at today, next year how much of a potential tailwind could you see to working cap from the lower commodity prices?"," It's a good question. I think that maybe the best way to characterize it is that at the peak we were seeing pretty substantial increases in both accounts receivable and inventories from the impact of inflation. I think that when we were looking at it in the third quarter, it was still probably $100 million to $150 million range of headwind that we were still burning through. We think we'll burn off a good chunk of that by year-end, sort of in line with the way that we generally would pull down accounts receivable and inventory. I don't really have a number for you off the top of my head for next year's cash flow results, but I think it's fair to say that we would see it as a tailwind. Again, to Chad's comments, so it's a little early to count any chickens on that just because of the volatility we've seen."
Timothy Daley,M. Chad Crow," So the first question, Chad, I was I guess hoping to better understand some of the commentary provided in the press release specifically around how the associates remained focused on developing close relationships with customers and have demonstrated this commitment in the third quarter. I don't think we've ever heard you use that terminology or language before to describe customer interaction. So, how should we be interpreting this? And does it signal any sort of change or, I guess, shift in focus on the sales strategy or kind of like its application of the sales force?"," No, certainly not a shift in focus. I mean, we try to be in the back pockets of all our customers and that's where you're going to provide the most value in helping them actually build the house and be more than just a building products distributor. And so we're constantly pushing our guys to solve our builders' needs, solve their pain points. So, no, certainly not a shift in strategy. It's always been a strategy of ours, but it's something we continually harp on."
Timothy Daley,M. Chad Crow," Understood. Thank you for that. And then I guess thinking about the – kind of as home price appreciation is starting to slow under rising affordability pressures, builders are losing their pricing power. So, how are you, I guess, keeping builders who are currently utilizing the manufactured products, I guess, away from switching back to cheaper stick framing under these new lower commodity prices?"," Well, most customers who use those products recognize the value in it and there's a lot of components to the value. Structurally, it's a better built house, less jobsite waste, increased cycle time. So you may have a few that try to shift, but I don't think the dip in commodity prices is really going to trigger that. During the depths of the downturn when framing labor costs hit rock bottom and commodity prices were down, that's where you'd seen builders more likely to re-evaluate the cost benefit. But I don't think we're anywhere near that right now."
Timothy Daley,M. Chad Crow," Got it. That sounds positive. So, I guess and then my second question, thinking about – obviously there's been solid growth in the kind of selling locations and the number of sales associates that you guys have active. So, what was that number in this quarter and I guess how are you thinking about the continued growth in these metrics over the next year?"," Well, for the year, we've probably added somewhere around 75 – or added or internally promoted around 75 sales folks. That's a gross number. We obviously have turnover. I don't have the net number handy. But, look, that's a big push of ours is really to put a focus on developing our sales force, developing our general managers and developing our employees overall. And so, that's going to continue to be a focus of ours."
Timothy Daley,M. Chad Crow," Got it. And then how about the growth next year, just any color or quantification you could provide, if possible?",Growth on sales force?
Timothy Daley,M. Chad Crow,Yes. Correct.," I would imagine we'll be pushing for a similar number, similar to this year."
Trey H. Grooms,Peter Jackson," I just have a few kind of last-minute ones here, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, one is, I know you've touched on it a couple of different times on this call and, Peter, I know you just mentioned SG&A. You kind of reiterated that, I think, on the 70% variable component. Does that still hold true if we kind of fast forward into next year and you continue to add to the sales force kind of at the pace that you've done in 2018? It sounds like you're going to continue on with that next year as well. Does that same mix still hold true there?",Yeah. I don't think there's a material change.
Trey H. Grooms,M. Chad Crow," Okay. Helpful. And then on the R&R piece being down 2.5% or 2.6%, I'm sorry if I missed it, but can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there, what's driving that? Is that expected to be down in the 4Q as well or just any color around that number?"," Yeah. As I said in the prepared comments, that's largely in the upper Midwest, the Ag region of the country where the tariff wars that are going on have really started impacting some of the farmers and made them cautious about spending. They're a big part of the business up in that part of the country. And to a lesser degree Alaska, although Alaska is performing a little better than last year, still relative to national numbers that you see in R&R, still underperforming a bit. So it's primarily those two markets for us."
Trey H. Grooms,Peter Jackson," Got it. Thanks. Sorry I missed that. And then with free cash flow, the target, $170 million to $190 million, expecting to come in at the low-end, I think that's what you guys said last quarter, too. But just wondering what was the driver of coming into the low-end. I understand the earlier part of the year when you had a big working capital draw with the higher lumber, but I would have thought it might be more of a tailwind with the commodity coming down and maybe might catch a little more benefit in the 4Q. Any just commentary around the direction there of going towards the low-end?"," Yeah. I'll be real candid that that type of cash flow forecasting for the year-end is always very challenging. We're looking at the numbers in detail and trying to dial it in. Part of it has to do quite simply with the burn-off of the – or the collection process around the sales and the burn-off of the inventory that we had earlier on in the year. I'm sure you can appreciate the fact that the averages look nice and easy, but down at the location level, it's a bit more challenging to see where's the wood, where are the receivables, and at what pricing, and then how are we burning it off. It's our best estimate. We're clearly going to shoot for more than that, but I think that $170 million is the right number for the guidance. But in light of that, we are still going to be below the 3.5 times levered number. That's a commitment that we are committed to and that we're looking forward to delivering on as sort of the final chapter in the ProBuild acquisition story."
Trey Morrish,Peter Jackson," ...to hear that. So, I guess I want to start on the SG&A. You clearly had a lot of benefit to your top-line sales but the leverage that you saw in the quarter wasn't nearly as good as you saw it in the second quarter of around 80 basis points improvement this quarter versus 130 basis points last quarter, despite the much better top-line growth because of the lumber inflation. So, could you talk about, like, what happened in the quarter? Was there anything unique why it was a little bit less of year-over-year improvement in the third quarter relative to the second quarter?"," Sure. I think you hit the nail on the head. We did have a good quarter. Sales were up. We did see leverage. We're very pleased with that. But I think your point is valid. There are some components we are seeing in our SG&A results. Some of it's real obvious. We had better profitability, so we saw increased incentive comp. That's probably the biggest piece. Another one is we pay more commissions when we have higher gross margins. So, predictably, our commission rate went up a bit. There are also some, I think, underlying expense. I think the inflation environment we're seeing is – I think it's fair to characterize that it continues to be a challenge. We called out fuel in the Q, so you'll see that. I think that's a continuing headwind. There's also a couple of internal aspects with regard to insurance. I think healthcare continues to be a headwind for us. The costs there are real and something we're battling through. And then I would say that wage inflation is a broad-based challenge for us. I think we're doing quite a good job at managing it, but it continues to be something that we see on an annual basis."
Trey Morrish,M. Chad Crow," Got it. Thanks for that. And then more high level, labor constraints are definitely a – we think are going to be a challenge for the remainder of this cycle, even if you're going through a period of slower growth. Could you talk about, with your large footprint for manufactured product sales, how you expect that part of your business to evolve and develop over the remainder of this cycle?"," Well, we're obviously making a lot of investments in that part of the business, the value-add side of the business, and expanding our footprint, and we will continue to do so. I do think the long-term trend is going to be less labor, less construction on the jobsite, and more done in plants or factories. And so, as we look further down the road – and I also think that labor is going to remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. So we're constantly investing in our truss and panel capacity, for example. And anywhere we can take some of that labor off the jobsite, I think that's where we're going to create the most value for our customers and create the most stickiness with our customers, and obviously that's going to result in higher margin."
