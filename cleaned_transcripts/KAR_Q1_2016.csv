Ali Faghri,James P. Hallett," So, total physical auction volumes were up 12%, and dealer consignment was up 10%. I think that implies commercial was up roughly 12% to 13% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from low-single digits last quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that specifically? Was that off-lease, repo, or maybe timing? And then also maybe some color on the cadence of volume trends at ADESA throughout the quarter."," Yeah. There is no question on the commercial is – there's just more and more volume coming. There's – these leases are continuing to come, and the question I've answered earlier, the grounding dealers passing on these cars and putting more vehicles into the funnel. And then with the financial institutions, those are writing more and more consumer credit, and that's just a straight math calculation. The more paper written, the more repos you're going to have. If I go back in history, we peaked at about 1.9 million repos back in 2008, 2009, and we took that number down to 1.1 million. Now we're seeing those repossessions climb back up to that 1.5 million, 1.6 million, and I would expect that number will continue to grow as they continue to write more and more paper. So, the heavy influence has been with the commercial cars – there's no question. And then, I think that on the dealer consignment, I'm extremely proud of what our ADESA organization has done with dealer consignment, and that was really an initiative that many of you are familiar with. It started back in 2009, and when we put that whole network in place, we have 300 people in the field approximately that are very focused on calling on dealers one at a time. We had people calling on the mid-sized groups and the large dealer groups, and we've just really created some good habits for our dealers. And we've started to treat the dealer consignment business more like we treat the commercial business, providing more and more services to them. And I think the proof is in the pudding. We're getting the results and our dealers are all about results and that they have a good experience. They're returning, and I think that dealer consignment team, again, has just done a remarkable job. And quite frankly, Eric and I have been saying this for probably the last two years or three years is, we are surprised that the dealer consignment numbers have held up as strong as they have when you consider the impact of all of these commercial vehicles coming back. So, it's really been a great win for us."
Ali Faghri,James P. Hallett,Great. And then just on the cadence of volume trends as well throughout the quarter.," I think, it's been steady. There was again..."
Anthony F. Cristello,James P. Hallett," The first question is sort of a bigger picture question. We continue to hear about more technology in the industry, dealers looking for ways to speed up the process of auction and/or move vehicles from dealer to dealer, and in some instances, bypassing auctions. And I know you've got TradeRev and some other initiatives. I'm wondering if you could expand on how you will take advantage of a shift perhaps in technology and be able to continue to better balance both the physical and online use of where things may evolve."," Yeah. I think, we're very much aware of potential disruption and how we could be disrupted, and I would like to tell you that if there's disruption that's going to occur, we'd like to be disrupting ourselves. And that's exactly what we're planning – what our plans are with TradeRev. We actually feel like we are disrupting ourselves there. So that – TradeRev continues to rollout, and we continue to add resources in the markets that we are in with TradeRev. We are experiencing what I would call success. We're seeing the numbers continue to grow on a monthly basis. We've brought in – we've enhanced some of our technology with other products. We've talked about Autoniq, which gives the dealer real values on his smartphone while he's in the lane. I think, it's being aware of what the technologies are that can really add value to the customers both on sell side and on the buy side, and allowing them to make better decisions. I think some of the things that we're doing with data and planning on doing with data in terms of big picture will give the buyers and sellers better information to be able to make more informed decisions. So Eric, do you want add something?"
Anthony F. Cristello,James P. Hallett," And I guess, it seems like so from the technology part on ADESA, you're sort of being part of that evolution of change. With IAA, it sounds like you're being able to help improve what the insurance company see as probably one of their bigger expenses. And so on that cycle time – or if you look at where the biggest opportunities are to communicating with the DMVs and improving that, is it being more efficient at that first notice of loss point? And are you able to see opportunities for yourself to continue to improve and obviously offer better services to your customers?"," I think, it's a little bit of all that you've mentioned really. You think about the technology, you think about the enhancements to our existing technology, bringing in new technologies that we've talked about, bringing in the data and the analytics and other things that we may be doing and working on, I think, if you – it's kind of that story a little bit plus, a little bit plus a little bit adds up to a lot. And it's just being very focused on what's going on in their industry and what the trends are and what the shifts are and making sure that we're staying ahead of the curve."
Benjamin Bienvenu,James P. Hallett," Touching on the salvage business, your acquisition that you made in the UK, I'd just be curious to hear the progress there, how discussions with insurance companies are going, to the extent you can opine, and then your thoughts on the broader market there as well."," As it turned out, our timing wasn't great when we did that acquisition. I think, as we said, scrap prices couldn't go any lower than they were at the time that we were getting that acquisition closed. And we've mentioned previously that we did go over and we sat with the management team. We did kind of restructure the business model a little bit, not in terms of the amount of cars bought, but in terms of some of the pricing that was going on. And as Eric mentioned in his commentary, we're pleased that HBC was a positive contributor in the first quarter, and we think we've got the business model right, and we think we can continue to grow that. And in terms of looking forward, we're a very, very, very distant number two player, but we think there is opportunity to do further consolidation, and we'll just have to stand by and see how that plays out."
Benjamin Bienvenu,James P. Hallett," Great. And then your comments earlier around active discussions and deals, should we think there's possible opportunities in both North America and abroad, and then also ADESA and IAA? Maybe give us a sense of what those opportunities look like by business segment."," Yeah. And I think you should think about all of our businesses and that we're actively looking at opportunities and targets, and you should think of them both domestically and internationally. And as I mentioned in the past, we're still very much a believer in brick and mortar. We believe brick and mortar still has a role to play here, and we can buy these at what we would believe are very attractive multiples. And as I've said previously, there's 5 to 10 what I would consider really plum-type acquisitions out there. Not that we're going to buy 5 to 10; that's not what I'm saying. Don't misunderstand that. But I'm saying of those 5 to 10, we are in active discussions with a number of those. And I would hope that we could possibly close on some additional independents with no time line in mind."
Bret Jordan,James P. Hallett," A question on the IAA inventory, up 4%. You talked about improved cycle times. Was there any impact from generally warmer and less icy weather in the Northern or Northeastern states, and then again some volume shift with farmers in the quarter, or is it primarily just the cycle times?"," Yeah. Bret, I'd mention that there certainly were some impact from the mild winter that we experienced. In terms of customers, we really don't get into talking about specific customers. But you have your wins and your losses, and they pretty much offset each other. But maybe the bigger impact was improving these cycle times. And as I mentioned in my commentary, especially with one very large customer that we mentioned previously that they had kind of taken a pause, and they kind of taken the time out to restructure a lot of their internal processes. And now that they've got those restructured and they're working with us in our Total Loss Solutions now in terms of how they cycle these vehicles to the market, that has reduced inventory at the end of the quarter."
Bret Jordan,Eric M. Loughmiller," Okay. Okay. And a housekeeping question on SG&A. You said $10 million of the incremental $20 million was acquired. How much of that was Brasher's eight, how do you see Brasher's adding to SG&A on the year?",Brasher's is not in our numbers.
Bret Jordan,Eric M. Loughmiller,Okay.," They were acquired April 1st, so they don't even hit for one day, Bret. But Brasher's, again, we'll give more color on that. We just closed the transaction. It will – it's got a business that looks very much like the ADESA business with about 25% – 24% or 25% EBITDA margins coming in. And it's a local operation. It'll fit very nicely in the business model of ADESA."
Craig R. Kennison,James P. Hallett," Great. Thank you for taking my question. It's really on this recall trend. I think, AutoNation recently announced a change to its recall policy and may end up ultimately wholesaling more vehicles if they can get the repair done in a timely fashion. If that goes mainstream, does that have any influence on your volume trends?"," Well, perhaps, it could increase our volume overall if they start wholesaling more of those vehicles, but I think that we would probably be required to get those recalls done before the vehicle got resold."
Gary Frank Prestopino,James P. Hallett," Yeah. A couple of questions. First of all, if Chicago starts rolling out this year, how long would a new site like that be a drag on the adjusted EBITDA results?"," Gary, typically, we would tell you for a Greenfield location to be cash flow positive, we normally look at it in a period of 12 months to 18 months. In the case of Las Vegas, which was the last one that we did, we're very pleased that we're cash flow positive there in the first 12 months. And let me say, I'm optimistic that we can have strong results going into that Chicago market. I think we're going in at a very good time. We absolutely got the ideal location. The buyer base is there. The cars are there. The customers are there. I'm expecting a strong performance there coming out of the gate."
Gary Frank Prestopino,James P. Hallett," Okay. Just was curious there. And then, just an industry question, in terms of the cars coming through lease or from lease returns, are you seeing less of an appetite for the grounding dealers to take these cars initially? They're flowing through the pipe and then going more towards the independent dealers versus the franchise dealers. Is there a shift that's starting to occur here because the franchise dealers have ample inventory of used cars now?"," I think, Gary, there's – first of all, the grounding dealer, the residuals are maybe a little bit higher than market value. So you're seeing the grounding dealer pass on some of these cars at termination. And then, when they're getting into, as we call the top of the funnel in the closed sale, there is a lot more vehicles to choose from, so the dealers can be more selective. And then, there's more cars going through the online open sale, which then brings in a whole new buyer base. It brings in all those independents, and you've already said it, but just to reinforce what you said, you've now got all those independents that are able to acquire some of this inventory as well. So, it's a combination of all those things, and primarily, all being driven by the residual value at termination."
Gary Frank Prestopino,Eric M. Loughmiller," Okay. And then, just the last question on the loan loss reserve increase, which is understandable because of the growth in the portfolio, but it is my understanding that, really, you would have a huge loss if there was some kind of an outright fraud at the dealership where the car was domiciled where they bought it from you. Is the increase in the loss reserve really a function over the time from when it was bought to what the market value is now and you've got to write down that loan?"," Yes, Gary, we actually – writing off the loan, actually this occurs so quickly given the nature of a floorplan lending business. But most of the losses are lost value in the vehicle where we feel we can't recover from other assets. But the most significant individual losses are what we call sold out of trust. The car is sold. The proceeds are received by the dealer, and they're not remitted for payment on the loan and there's no collateral for us to act upon. As you would suspect, even in declining values, that loss would be relatively minor if we could repossess the car. But if the car is in the possession of a consumer, consumer protection laws prohibit us from repossessing from the consumer even though we may have held title as collateral. So, again, the losses you see are heavily weighted by the car sold out of trust."
Matthew J. Fassler,James P. Hallett,It's a terrific quarter obviously.,Thank you.
Matthew J. Fassler,Eric M. Loughmiller," First question, on ASP and ARPU, can you talk about the degree to which underlying pricing is changing in any way to help drive that number. And then also, Eric, related to that, if you could – I appreciate the enhanced disclosure. If you could just repeat precisely which numbers are impacted by the returned vehicles, and so what the reported number is and what the adjusted number is just so we can get the right context?"," Okay. On the average selling price, I think, you're seeing what's being published. You're seeing call it 3% or so declines in the average selling price. But when you think about what that does – Jim mentioned it. What that does to the consignor who is trying to optimize if not maximize residuals, they're going to spend money on the car and we see that, Matt. So that's the answer to that. On the online-only and the ADESA Assurance Program, thank you, I can repeat that, and you'll see it in the 10-Q that we file tonight. We reported $116 per car sold compared to $109 in the prior year. And when I take out the ADESA Assurance Program and I'll give you an example that's directionally correct. That number should be $110 because on a car that we purchase – we repurchase under our assurance and then resell, there's no real economic value to that transaction. We're just making good on our promise. That $110 compared to $105 if I excluded the past year, by giving you that $6 number and the number of units we sold, you can calculate the value of the ADESA Assurance Program. And when you consider most of those are off-lease cars, let's hypothetically use a value of $15,000 per car that means that 75 cars sold is all in the quarter. That's how small the number of cars is, yet it had a $6 influence. That's all things you'll get out. It's in our earnings supplement, Matt. But that's what I was calling out because I felt you might reach the wrong impression on the growth in ARPU there. When these 75 out of, what, 180,000 cars or whatever the number was, let me look it up, I should give you the right number, it was a distortion that I felt we needed to clarify."
Matthew J. Fassler,James P. Hallett," Got it. And also, just rephrasing the first part of the question, on your fees per se, has there been any change in your pricing or your fee structure of late that would help explain the ASP acceleration, or is it really more about mix in the ancillary services that are being added to the package?"," Yes. Matt, I think, it's a little bit of both, primarily, I would say, focused on the ancillary services and the things that are going on there. But as I've always said, at ADESA more so, we continuously are monitoring the buying fees. And these are nationwide increases, these sometimes can be regional increases or local increases, and there have been some of those go in place probably in the first quarter. But again, I would take you back to – I would focus on the increase in ancillary services more so."
Matthew J. Fassler,Eric M. Loughmiller," Great. And then just one follow-up from that. So your reported gross margin in ADESA was up, I believe, 98 basis points. It's the first increase of anything in that magnitude you've had in at least two years, maybe more. And you've had other quarters where your volume growth has come close to this. So was that really an outgrowth of that – of pricing in the average revenue per vehicle, or is there something else on the cost side, which I know you alluded to. Is that what's contributing to the better flow-through at the gross profit line?"," Matt, as we look at it, the gross profit is coming really, I think, through the mix of vehicles getting us that leverage in the use of the shops, and it's from the ancillary services. Also, you look at things like PAR and our repossession activity, again, very good utilization. While that might be a lower margin business, it has a lot of scale in it, and we're getting the activity. So, it's more the scale with a little bit coming from the auction fees margin. That would be slightly up, but not account for a significant portion of that 90 basis points."
Robert Labick,James P. Hallett," Hi. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just according to some trade magazines, TradeRev has moved into the Washington, D.C. area, and I was wondering if you could just talk about your progress and your plans on rolling out in the U.S. Obviously, it started in Canada and stuff. And just tell us how long you would expect this to take or how you're planning the rollout, if there's a lot of capital that has to go behind it at all. Give us some more insight on to that, please."," Yeah. So a couple things. First of all, I'll acknowledge the Washington, D.C. market. We did have a press release announcing that TradeRev is now representing the Pohanka Group there. I think, it's 17 stores, and we're managing – we're selling, I believe, the majority or all of their vehicles, all of their trade vehicles and overaged inventory on TradeRev. So, that was a big announcement for us. We've also updated our technology on TradeRev. We've come out with what we call TradeRev 3.0. That's been rolled out in both Canada and the U.S. We've added a number of resources here in the U.S. in terms of people. And it's really one market at a time, and it's just getting to these markets in an organized manner. And the markets that we're in, we're experiencing success, like the one you mentioned with Pohanka. Pohanka is not the only deal. But we're experiencing success. We're building the buyer base, and we're building the seller base as well. And again, we're seeing positive trends where the volume continues to reach new levels each month. So, we're very pleased with TradeRev. But I think the thing that I would remind you of is I do believe TradeRev has an opportunity to really be transformational in that dealer-to-dealer space. But I wouldn't want to suggest that this is going to be an overnight deal. I think, this is with a longer term vision. I think about TradeRev as really being fully deployed and really hitting on all eight as they say probably over the course of what I would think the next three years to five years. I think it has the opportunity to really transform that dealer space. So, with all that said, we're very pleased with what we're seeing."
Ryan Brinkman,James P. Hallett," So obviously ADESA was great from both a volume and ARPU perspective. There was expectation volume to track higher, maybe not quite as high as it did, but obviously it's been strong for a while. From my conversations, the ARPU was a big surprise though. Can you walk us through in a little bit greater detail about the headwinds and the tailwinds to ADESA ARPU? Maybe you can help us sort of gauge the magnitude of the impact to ARPU from, say, lower used car prices. And then we know that ARPU increases from ancillary services just as more fuel cars fall further down into the funnel. But is there also this, like, paradoxically this tailwind where the lower used car prices go, people want to do more ancillary services to preserve residuals? How to think about that?"," Yeah, Ryan. I think you've got – first of all, what you got is you've got sellers wanting to maximize the resale price, getting the most money they can for the vehicle. And so, they're doing more and more work to achieve better results, financial results from the car. The second thing is they want to convert at a higher rate. They want to get more of these vehicles sold the first time through the auction. And the best way to assure that they can get these vehicles sold the first time through the auction is to do more work to them. And the third thing that many of these manufacturers are focused on is they're focused on residual values and keeping those residual values as high as they can, going forward with additional leasing. So all in all, we are seeing increased utilization. And it's really a question of, how do I make my car stand taller? How do I separate my car from the pack and attract more buyers to my lane versus the lane beside me? So, it's a combination of all those things, I think, that has really driven the revenue here, and I think that the opportunity continues as we see more and more of these leased cars coming and more of these leased cars, and repossessed vehicles making their way to the physical auctions, we feel that there is opportunity to continue to grow those ancillary services. Eric?"
Ryan Brinkman,James P. Hallett," Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, to just kind of follow up on the ADESA volume side then. With the big increase, have you started to think about when growth is inevitably going to kind of normalize lower? If we look at the year-over-year increases in lease originations, it looks like the peak increase was in 2013. Is that what you see? And then, I know you don't guide to 2017 obviously, but off lease – and it's going to grow clearly through 2019, but is it also fair to say that it peaks this year? And then, just on a related note, so the potential for modest increase is kind of beyond 2019, not like we're seeing now, but it looks like lease penetration has gone from, like, 30% at the start of 2016 to 34%, 35% now. What do you think is driving that and do you care to guess how high it could potentially go?"," Well, I'll start with your leasing question. On the leasing part, I think, it comes back to the fact that people can afford half a car, more than they can the full car, and leasing is really being able to drive a new car and your payment – and it's really matching your payment. So there's just more of an attraction to leasing in the fact that you get to turn the car over every three to four years, I think, is still part of the American culture. In terms of..."
Ryan Brinkman,James P. Hallett," Okay. And then last question is on online-only ARPU. I heard, Jim, in the prepared remarks say – I think you said it was up like $109, something like that. When you think about – when growth in online-only was preventing the incremental volume from flowing through to physical, which is no longer the case, I remember you were asked on these calls if there is anything you could do to help get increased fees from online-only, and your response then was kind of like, we're trying but it's really, really hard. So I'm just curious how you're able to take up that online-only ARPU and what the outlook for that is maybe going forward."," I think, Ryan, the biggest opportunity there has been what we've been able to do in the open sale. When that car goes from close to open, then we're able to expose that vehicle to a whole new buyer base beyond the franchise dealers. And I think that's where we're able to increase our fees. As you know, the economics get much, much better in the open sale, and that's where we've been able to increase the average fee or the average revenue per car on those online sales."
William R. Armstrong,James P. Hallett," Good morning, gentlemen. In Insurance Auto Auctions looks like the declines in revenue per vehicle are getting less negative. I was wondering if you could just discuss what you're seeing in terms of scrap pricing. Is that starting to become less of an issue? And you were mentioning cycle time is reducing. Is that helping your revenue per vehicle in any way?"," Bill, as I said, I don't think scrap prices can go any lower. So, anything is going to be an improvement. And we are seeing a slight improvement in scrap prices. Also, Eric mentioned we're seeing a slight improvement in currency as well. And then – so, yes, that is helping mildly I would say, very mildly at this point in time. And certainly, the improvement in the cycle time is just moving these cars to the system quicker."
William R. Armstrong,James P. Hallett," Does that cycle time improvement really – does that help your revenue per vehicle, or is it more maybe a help on the gross margin side?"," Bill, to the extent that they get a higher auction price because it didn't further depreciate, there might be a slight tick up in the buy fee, but that would be the only way you'd see it."
