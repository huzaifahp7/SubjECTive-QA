Harlan Sur,Ford G. Tamer," Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good to see the reacceleration in the business here. Good to see the -- you're PAM4 Polaris and Vega products still on track here Q2 and second half of this year. Are you guys still anticipating double-digit incremental revenue contribution this year from these products? And then if you look at your Polaris and Vega design win pipeline, roughly how many opportunities have you won so far with these products?"," Thank you, Harlan. So the first question, are we expecting double-digit revenue this year? Absolutely, we already have tens of thousands of units on order, firm orders for the year. Second question …"
Harlan Sur,Ford G. Tamer,How many opportunities have you won in this whole …," Yes, sorry the second question -- yes, the second question on the number of opportunities as in tens of opportunities, Harlan, we win in excess of 50."
Harlan Sur,Ford G. Tamer,Got it. Thank you. And then last call you guys mention the initial ramp of 400-gig long-haul Metro using a 45 and 64 Gigabaud coherent driver and TIAs solution in the second half. Is that still on track and roughly how many customers are you ramping these new solutions into?," Thank you, Harlan. So, yes 345 Gigabaud and 64 Gigabaud products are on track. We're renting it to over 10 customers and or intends of different design wins at those customers. And we are still very positive on both the TIA and driver for the 45 and 64 Gigabaud generations."
Harlan Sur,Ford G. Tamer," Great. And then just one housekeeping question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. So the team is anticipating given the mix of business and growth in the second half to get gross margins into that kind of 71%, 72% range in the second half of the year. Is that what I heard"," Yes, that's correct. Based on the M200 shipping and production, and the higher gross margins with the coherent DSPs buoying up the gross margin, so that’s 71% to 72% range, yes."
Jeremy Kwan,Ford G. Tamer," Yes, thank you guys for taking my call. Just wanted to follow-up briefly on ZTE and expectations there. You mentioned that there is potential for some market share shifts to go there. Can you give us a sense of maybe potential timing for that?"," Jeremy, if we could answer this question, I wouldn’t be working. So I would say that’s a very difficult question to answer. I’m not sure we know the answer. It's a geopolitical question and that’s beyond my pay grade, I think."
Jeremy Kwan,Ford G. Tamer,Okay. And maybe just to follow-up …," Maybe you can ask the question differently. As far as trying to determine whether this is going to be resolved or not, it's a very difficult question. I think what we’re doing is, we’ve been conservative. We’ve taken the ZTE out of our 2018 forecast and we’ve different model scenarios for 2019, where we assume that if this doesn’t get resolved, this could go to customers that either have the DSP, the TIA and the driver, all coming from Inphi or it could go to customer that have the DSP coming from either their internal effort or a competitor effort. So we’ve got a whole range of different models for 2019 that we will be happy to discuss on a one-on-one, but 2018 to be conservative we’ve taken it out of the revenue."
Jeremy Kwan,John S. Edmunds," Understood. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And maybe just switching gears, I guess, then to the balance sheet. Just that uptick in the CapEx, is this -- do you see this as a kind of a one-time thing or is it kind of an indication of more sustained capital investment ahead from your product launches?"," Yes, thanks for the question, Jeremy. Basically we do see CapEx in particularly investing in mask sets as kind of an ongoing part of our spending. And as we -- today we’re shipping and taking out things primarily in CMOS, in 60 nanometer. So I think for this year, we'll see some additional tape out expenditure in 60 nanometer and then maybe late next year we will see or probably in the first half of next year we will see a 7 nanometer tape out at some stage. So obviously gets more expensive as you go down geometry and you have to factor that into your capital spending plan."
Joe Moore,Ford G. Tamer," Great. Thank you. I know your guidance is sort of ¼ a time, but last quarter you had made some comments about the shape of the year and sort of getting back to Q4 '17 levels towards the end of the year. Is that still generally the way you’re feeling about things, and I’ve a follow-up."," Yes, Joe, we still feel the same way about the year minus the impact of ZTV we just discussed."
Joe Moore,Ford G. Tamer," Okay, great. And then I guess just the ZTE, just to make sure I understand, I mean, you talked about the exposure levels. Is that -- how solid is that number and I guess -- because I guess when we had the Huawei situation, I, at least had underestimated those exposures because it was not just what you’re selling to Huawei, but what you’re selling to people upstream from Huawei. That 1% to 5% is sort of comprehensive, that’s the total impact that you would expect from this, right?"," Thank you, Joe. Yes, so the 1% is a Q2 impact ramping up to 5% over Q4 impact and that's our best estimate of this point for both direct and indirect sales. So that would be directed to ZTE and directed to the ICR vendors that would use our TIAs and supply back to ZTE."
Mark Kelleher,Ford G. Tamer," Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just follow-up that last question, maybe ask in a different way. I think you indicated that COLORZ came in a little stronger in the quarter than you had anticipated. Is that just fluctuation or is that sustainable?"," The business with COLORZ tends to be a little lumpy based on a construction schedule. So it may have been slow depending on the timing of the project and so forth. So in general the business there is solid and sustainable over the next couple of years, which is what we’ve conveyed to investors."
Mark Kelleher,John S. Edmunds," Okay. And just to kind of step back, if I look at all the new product introductions that are coming out this year, and I look at the two key markets, the long-haul Metro market and the data center market, which one do you think with all these introductions, which one do you think is going to be stronger this year?"," Well, I think you have a couple of things going on there more so. One is the long-haul and Metro business is going to recover in China, and then we'll see the M200 and the coherent DSP launch in there as well as a 45 and 64 Gigabaud technology. So I think they all do nicely this year, and then on the data center side we have the PAM businesses that’s driving forward, elucidated earlier with several different products launching and driving growth in that area. And that's really just the beginning of that particular cycle, so we'll see more PAM growth in the next several years."
Mark Kelleher,John S. Edmunds,Would you say more visibility on the data center side?," Not necessarily. I think we have good visibility on both sides. But we have obviously data center has a lot more volume and sort of interested parties and so it tends to have a greater allure that way, but the long-haul metro size is very solid and very profitable."
Mark Kelleher,Ford G. Tamer,Okay. Thanks.," Mark, if I may. This is Ford. I did go through a enumeration of the different growth vector on the PAM side. So if you don’t let me -- allow me to do the same for the Metro long-haul to give you a bit of a feel for what's going on there. So currently we're -- our bread-and-butter is really the 32 Gigabaud coherent TIA and driver. They continue to be number one. 400-gig and both MSA and CFP modules. So that's really the major volume shipment today. The second wave after this is our 45 Gigabaud product, our non-mass production and those are going to allow us to build the 200 gig module for MSA and CFP2 module and that will continue to ramp in the next several years. The third leg then is our 64 Gigabaud product. And again, these are doing extremely well, 10s of customers in terms of design wins and those are being designed for 400-gig and 600-gig platform and line card, daughter card, CFP2, OFFP, QSFP-DD modules. And so that again we will start renting in the second half of this year and going to be a workhorse for many years to come. So you could see even in the Metro long-haul we’ve got now three legs of growth if you wish. Our current 32 Gigabaud business followed by the 45 Gigabaud and then the 64 Gigabaud just getting started. So we're as bullish as on the Metro long-haul as we are in the inside data center having multiple legs on both side."
Paul Silverstein,Ford G. Tamer," Thanks. Ford and John, can you give us any update on -- I recognize there's sensitivity, but given how big Microsoft has been with -- for you historically with COLORZ, what is the outlook there? Is there any chance of a meaningful softening at the particular customer. I was hoping you could also tell us what the ClariPhy revenue was for the quarter?"," Thanks, Paul. We are on track with Microsoft and let John take the question on DSP."
Quinn Bolton,Ford G. Tamer," Hey, guys. Let me eco my congratulations on the finding the bottom and the nice 15% recovery in Q2. Ford, I guess, I wanted to start. Obviously, that ZTE shipment ban has impacted the business I think specifically for you. On the M200 ramp, can you give us some sense how important that customer was for the M200 ramp and without that customer how do you now see the M200 ramping into the second half of the year?"," Thank you, Quinn. So the impact we discussed was including that new M200 win that we had one from our competitor. And we were expecting this to be about when we discussed a 5% impact to our Q4 revenue, you could think about it as about half of that -- 2.5% to 3% of that’s coming from DSP and the balance coming from the TIA and driver, okay. So the way we're thinking about it, it all depends how long it takes to resolve this ban at this point where assuming we took the revenue out of the year assuming the ban takes long to resolve. The DSP revenue is not one that we could get back if the ban takes too long to resolve, but the TIA and driver is potentially revenue. We could get back if the business gets driven to another Inphi customer. So that's how we’re looking at it at this point, Quinn. I’m not sure if I’m answering your question, but hopefully that gives you some color."
Quinn Bolton,Ford G. Tamer," Maybe, Ford, just a clarification. I mean, I guess, was ZTE sort of will you clarify -- characterize them as perhaps the lead customer for M200. I mean, could they have been the biggest customer for that DSP or do you have a good set of M200 design wins that you still see a pretty good ramp of that product without ZTE?"," Thank you, Quinn. So we have about 10 M200 customers, ZTE would've been probably the third in line if you wish. There are two customers, one European and one Chinese that are ahead of them from a volume and revenue point of view. And then we've got other North America, European, and Chinese customer that make up the balance. So it's a diversified base, ZTE would've been probably the third in line from a revenue prioritization point of view."
Quinn Bolton,Ford G. Tamer," Perfect. That’s what it is like a printing. Just a second question, as you look at what happened a couple of years ago, when ZTE first had their shipment ban, Huawei went into a fairly significant inventory accumulation phase for probably six to nine months after that have you seen any response from Huawei? I know it's only been -- probably a couple of weeks since this news hit, but have you seen any change in purchasing behavior from Huawei given the ZTE shipment ban.",At this point we have not seen any change in Huawei behavior and we're being told that there will not be any change in Huawei behavior.
Richard Shannon,Ford G. Tamer," Hi, Ford and John, thanks for taking my questions as well. And also a question on 400-gig data center. You talked about a ramp or at least multiple ramps happenings with the 400-gig PAM4 related products latest early next year. Ford, do you think that is derisked in terms of other ecosystem constraint switch chipsets etcetera or do you still see some risk there?"," Thank you, Richard. Good question. So really what Inphi is about is at this point providing solutions for the whole range of customers. And as I said we're seeing the market divide up if you wish into three different buckets. The first bucket is going to be the early -- earliest customer to go to production on PAM. It's going to be 200-gig and 400-gig along was Polaris and a 50-gig PAM and that will start in Q2. Then the second and third leg are going to be the 100-gig and 400-gig. So we’re seeing actually some customers decide that the 100-gig modules are cost effective and deciding to stick with CWDM4 module is 100-gig so they take these 12.8 terabit switches and 428 ports of 100-gig and there we sell our Vega retimer. While other customers are deciding to put 400-gig modules and there we settle our Porrima chip that goes into 400-gig modules. So you could see customers supporting 100, 200 and 400, and we support all three. The other interesting thing for us is we're discovering -- there is probably even a bigger market for short reach application than for long reach and we're supporting that as well. And we finally have some customers that are interested even in 50-gig type of SFP type of modules and we support that was Polaris, and that's a pretty nice application. So you could see we are multifaceted and have solutions that fit all the customers as platform solution, not justly dependent the DSP or retimer, but it also goes with TIA and driver to complete the platform."
Richard Shannon,Ford G. Tamer," Okay. Thanks for that detail [indiscernible] other questions I might have asked otherwise. Maybe my follow-up question, Ford, will on COLORZ. You’ve talked about some development, say, outside the United States, I think in China. Any updates you can give us in terms of business development there?"," Yes. Thank you, Richard. So as far as the next business development for COLORZ, we’re still working in all geographies. We have actually interest from China, from North America, and from European customers. As you mentioned, the lead cloud customer right now as the second potential customer, it's a China one, but we actually have another one that’s a potential U.S cloud customer, still working on it. Then we’re working with networking OEMs that are serving both the enterprise market and the service provider market and those are in all geographies, in China, in North America and in Europe. So this is where the next business development will come from."
Ross Seymore,Ford G. Tamer," Hi, guys. Thanks for allotting me ask a question and congrats on finding the bottom in china. So Ford, I really wanted to ask about that first. It sounds like you’re going to have the expected rebound sequentially albeit off of a slightly smaller base. Any more color about the sustainability of that as much as that possible in that sector?"," Yes. Thanks, Ross. I think the course for the rebound is that China Inventory off Coherent TIA and driver has returned to normal. In particular, our direct ICR customer as well as indirect OEM sharply cut the coherent TIA inventory by more than a factor of two, so it's not slightly below one quarter demand which is normal for industry considering the log manufacturing lead-time that we have. So with that, we feel more confident also on the driver inventory is even lower and matches up with demand in lead time, Ross."
Ross Seymore,Ford G. Tamer," Great. And I guess as a follow-up, switching over to the data center side of things, you’ve a lot of new products that you rattled off earlier. Can you just give us a some rough chronology of how you think those will contribute to revenue through the end of this year and into next year, whether it's the DSP side of things, within the data center COLORZ customers, any sort of color on that would be great?"," Yes, thank you, Ross. So the first time will be our 200-gig and 400-gig Polaris PAM DSP. That’s a DSP that is based on a 50-gig PAM, 50 gigabit for a second PAM standard which is a 28 Gigabaud for the TIA and driver for the optical speed. So that start shipping this quarter, driven first by a non-switch application that are one of our major cloud customers. And then it continues to ramp and then we expected towards end of this year, early next year to ship along with the new 12 point ET or 12 point in terabit switches that we go in production. So that’s the first one, Ross. The second one is that same product, that same Polaris DSP. We expected to start shipping in Q3 of this year with an InfiBand customer and again to rent from there moving forward. Then the third vector is going to be our second product, which is the Vega 200 -- 400 gig retimer again based on a 50 gig Pam (50) gigabit for second Pam or 20 Gigabaud TIA driver or optical interfaces. And that start shipping along with switch customer. It was first switch -- first shipped on line cards in the second half of this year. And then we have a new application now of that retimer where it can be used reverse gearbox to drive along with 12 in Tb switches to drive 128 ports or 100-gig. Optical modules and that we have a lot of interest in that application. We expect that to again ship into this year early next year. So that’s the third vector. So, first, Polaris found. Second Polaris, InfiBand, third Vega retimer, fourth is Porrima, which is our new 400 gigabit, Polaris -- Porrima PAM DSP. This is based on a 100 gigabit per second PAM and then the equivalent 56 Gigabaud TIA and driver. And that we expect to ship along. Again, was 12.8 terabit switches early next year driven by cloud customers wanting to go to 400-gig modules to go on all the switches. So a longer answer, but hopefully that gives you the chronology almost."
Tore Svanberg,Ford G. Tamer," Yes. Thank you. So I was stuck there for a bit, but I'm back on. So I may have missed some of this, but, Ford, could you just talk a little bit more about some of the Porrima time lines and perhaps even inflection points that we should be looking for? So, I think the current consensus is that maybe you start to see some revenues from Porrima first half of next year, but if you could go through some of the timeline and some of the milestones for us to look after, that will be great."," Yes. So, Tore, just to clarify, we had a detailed question where we went through Polaris and Vega will ramp this year and then Porrima next year. Do you want me to go through Polaris and Vega, or your question just is focused on Porrima?"
Tore Svanberg,Ford G. Tamer," You know, I already heard the answer to that question, so this is exclusively about Porrima."," Okay. So Porrima exclusively really is starting first quarter next year. There'll be some samples revenue this year that will not be insignificant, so we will be shipping samples quantity this year, but you could take off Porrima production in Q1 '19."
Tore Svanberg,Ford G. Tamer," Okay. And can you put some framework around that in relation to the Tomahawk III. I mean there's lot of speculation back and forth, but based on what you can tell is that product is now sampling too and on schedule?"," As far as we know, the switches are sampling on schedule. There are switch silicon sampling from Broadcom plus another vendor that is also sampling and I think people now with Innovium. So we’ve got at least with this point there are two switch silicon sampling. Broadcom and Innovium are both sampling 12.8 terabit switches. And the market today, both on track. As far as the customers, so far as I said, one major cloud vendor has publicly discussed they’re going to go to 200-gig module and then the 400-gig with 2x 200. Another cloud customer has publicly discussed the fact they’re going to go with 100-gig modules, and the third cloud customer has discussed the fact they’re going to go with 400-gig module, and the rest is still deciding. So I think you could see a split in the market as far as who is going to do what, which plays to Inphi's strengths, because in order to service those three cloud customers, you need a Polaris, you need a Vega and you need the Porrima. So each one of those three configuration I just discussed is going to require a different DSP or retimer, and at this point as far as I know we’re the only one sampling all three flavors to customers today."
Tore Svanberg,Ford G. Tamer," Okay. That’s very helpful. And then just last question back to China long-haul Metro, so I understand Q2 is obviously sort of getting back to true consumption. But do you have any data points or anything to share with us on consumption scheduled for the second half of the year?"," What we can share, Tore, is we expect the port count growth in China to be approximately 20% or so this year and consistent with other third-party forecast. So as an example, Cignal AI is forecasting the worldwide coherent port growth to be about 27% from 388,000 ports to 494,000 ports. So it shows the growth is resuming in China in 2018 and this is a worldwide forecast, China is about half of those ports. So our current forecast is actually less aggressive than Cignal AI. We're currently forecasting 20% versus Cignal AI of 27% and that would drive growth in the second half."
