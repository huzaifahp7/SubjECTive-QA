David Gold,Dennis Kakures," Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, can you walk us through a little bit of the guidance. What's embedded it may or by way of California budget? Is that predicated on the five proposals that you are looking for to pass?"," Actually if you look at the California budget situation currently we feel for the remainder of 2009 this impact whether that passes or not or probably minimal of the key item for us thus far is in the fact that bonds were able to be sold in March and April. And what that did was fund about $2 billion worth of about $2.5 billion of school construction related project that had been put on hold. They were either “shovel ready” projects or projects that were just starting off as they have frozen. So when we look at the rest of this year, although we would love to see the initiatives pass on May 19th, its less critical to this year than it is to the 2010 school year in our mind."
David Gold,Dennis Kakures,So presumably the bonds that have been sold basically provide all the funding that you would need to sort of to get to that range?," Let's put it this way, the fact that the December 18th stalled projects are now up and running, at least the great majority of them. That was a very important item."
David Gold,Dennis Kakures," On that note, I guess if we go back a quarter ago on that call you pointed to looking for the budget to pass and basically without it, I think you said something along the lines, there were some [stalled] projects like you said, presumably with some [retained] projects? So now that the dollars are out there, you are withholding guidance. Is that to say that your money hasn’t come through maybe as quickly as a matter of -- in other words if the situation is better why wouldn’t guidance be given now?"," Well the situation I'd say is better. It turned out that having those initiatives passed in May became less important once the bonds were sold. The bonds were the key to be able to fund the 50% that the state needs to provide for these modernization projects. So that was what was most critical and I would still say that fact of the initiatives passing on May 19th, that also important buts it’s a longer term, that has a longer term dynamic until -- and if they don’t pass, we'd expect they've got – they will sit down and figure out another approach. So, I would just say that what occurred with the bond being sold was -- we believe that the state would find a way to make things work. Now, it turned out that it was a fact that they sold bond before they had a formal balanced budget with the initiatives passing. So,  one happened before the other and that really satisfied what we were looking for in our plans for this year."
David Gold,Keith Pratt," Okay. All right. That's fair. And then sort of another piece of that, the way of G&A I can tell that you're managing that quite tightly? And just curious, if there is more potential progress there or would you use the first quarter as the good run rate?"," Yeah. I go back to what we've said in February, I think it still holds true. What we said in February was to remind everyone where we spend $58 million in SG&A for the total business in 2008. We said our goal was to really hold the line at SG&A in spite of the fact that we are funding some new organic initiatives and really see the incremental SG&A just be tied to Adler. And you’ll see in the press release, Adler was appropriately $1.8 million of s incremental SG&A in the first quarter. And what we said was for the full year '09, we were expecting SG&A somewhere in the $8 million to $9 million range for Adler. I think that still holds true. We are going to be adding incrementally some additional personnel at to Adler over the course of this year, some of that we've already begun. But I think, in short what we try to beat that goal and manage cost to tightly as we can, absolutely. So if we can do better then the $58 million of last year with another eight or nine added to account for the addition of  Adler which takes you into the $66 million to $67 million we are in for the year. If we can beat that, we will and we are very focused on careful management of cost and we are very focused on looking at business activity levels in all areas and making adjustments if we need to."
David Gold,Keith Pratt," Hi. Can you give a little bit more detail on the CapEx in the period? I guess, it sounded like it was pretty close to last year?"," Yeah David, for the first quarter just looking at the cash flow statement we spent 24 and .4 million on capital and that's comparable to last year, a little bit lower. The thing I would say about our outlook on capital spending, first of all, as we had suggested in the past, our capital spending would be diverted more to the new initiative areas. So, that would include Adler Tank rentals, it would also include portable storage and environmental test equipment and well over half of what we spent in the first quarter was directed towards those new initiative areas. The other thing is because they are new initiatives, I think the capital spending will be more [towards] in the first half of the year for those and then probably tapering off a bit in the second half of the year. Really the capital we need to put in what I call the traditional modular and electronics businesses, that is very low and it really reflects the fact that utilization of the equipment pools is low compared to where we would like it to be."
Jamie Sullivan,Keith Pratt," Wondering can you talk a little bit about Florida. It sounds like, that market was holding up a little bit better commercial, construction was actually doing fairly well and giving you a new entry. You just commented on what you've seen change in the marketplace and also in the class size reduction initiative; I think you had a comment that there have been some delays or some non-renewals of that initiative, could comment there?"," Certainly, first on the commercial side, I think the prepared remarks really centered around what a difficult market it's been this year especially on single and doublewide type rentals. So just to be clear on that, that was a very tough market in Q1. commercially. On the educational side, what occurred with class size reduction for the 2009, 2010 school year is the constitutional amendment on class size reduction with having the ratio is being met on the classroom level rather than on a school level. They went from district to school to classroom by design when they initially put together the legislation and what the state did because of that very tight budget situation in Florida is, they differed districts having to go to that until of the 2010-2011 school year. So class size reduction is still fully in place, they just got a one year reprieve so to speak and next year, in 2010-2011 they would have to go to make those reductions at a classroom level."
Jamie Sullivan,Dennis Kakures," Okay. And how much of Mods today is in the Mid-Atlantic, is it less than 5%?",Yes. It's very small although I will say that we’re making some good initial steps there with our new product introductions. Its small buts it’s a longer-term growth item for us but again good progress to-date in terms of getting the seed planted and getting the few nice orders here recently.
Jamie Sullivan,Dennis Kakures," Okay and then just I guess on cost measures, have you -- what have you done to-date is that part of how you're able to maintain the outlook here based on little bit deeper cost control then we talked about a few months ago."," We're highly focused, as Keith mentioned a moment ago, I mean without -- based upon our volume driven for each division, we take cost out as we need to on the production side and processing side based on volume. I mean I spoke to some of the cuts on our call earlier this year about salary freezes, reduction in bonus levels, a reduction in equity grants and those types of items. So, we've taken a very surgical approach to things and really tried to do things smartly and we’re continuing to monitor this very tightly to take cost out of the business as warranted."
Jamie Sullivan,Keith Pratt," Okay and I guess just on interest rate, not the interest rate, the interest expense that came in a bit lower than expected, is that at a level that could be sustained for the year. Do you expect to continue to pay down debt, how that creep down assuming interest rate stays the same."," They key to it is LIBOR. Most of our borrowing through a revolving credit lines and essentially we pay a margin over LIBOR. We're typically borrowing one or three months LIBOR. And over the really the last couple of months, there are at historical lows, that's benefiting us. So interest expenses was around 2.5% in the aggregate for the first quarter. Really if LIBOR stays low, if credit markets conditions do not deteriorate, we do not see a tightening or a spike. It is possible we could stay right around door levels that we saw in Q1."
Jamie Sullivan,Keith Pratt,Hi. Couple of quick questions. On the income statement rental related and other lines that was up year-over-year. Is that related to returns and pick ups and things like that?," Not specifically. When we have the rental for modulars, the rental related services, those revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the initial contract. So it might be over one, two or three years whatever the appropriate time frame is. So when you see movement in that line item particularly from modulars it can simply relate to the ebb and flow of particular projects being really running their course in terms of the initial contract and the revenues associated with them being recognized."
Jamie Sullivan,Keith Pratt,Okay.,And we also announced line items for modulars. We'll periodically have a customer request that we move some buildings or classrooms to a new location and you can think of that as a project where there is no new units put on rent but there are revenues that are come to us to do that work.
Jamie Sullivan,Keith Pratt," Okay. So if I look at the line did you combine, those were 15% year-over-year?"," Yes, keep in mind there is some dollars in this as well for Adler. So you will see in the segment reporting, we've broken that out for you."
Jamie Sullivan,Dennis Kakures,Okay. Alright and then just how much is Texas of the modular business?,We don’t break it out. What we have done here. Well we'll just tell you historically and currently probably about 65 to 70% of business is California based and the balance of Modular's is outside of the state and that's in a trend that's been moving lower -- that percentage of California business has been lower. It's been impacted by the California business level as well as increases in other states.
Jamie Sullivan,Dennis Kakures,Okay. And the increases will be coming mostly from Texas,Well actually its Texas and the mid-Atlantic is kicking and some in Florida.
Jim Nazareth,Dennis Kakures," Good afternoon everyone. I guess I will pick in the other state, Texas where you have some business there. I am wondering was the drop in activity, you said it was tied to oil. But could you just give us a little bit more granularity as to what you are seeing in that market. I guess on sequential basis?"," Well in Texas a great amount of our commercial side of the business there are tied to oil industry. We provide the structures in office space for a lot of the plants, when they are doing projects, different turnarounds at the plants and those type of items. And when their business gets slower and they get most cost conscious and so forth, that impacts our business directly. And also if it is slower in that area, they are going to be slow in petrochemical plants and other related industries. And in the educational business that we have in Texas is much smaller than in the other states where we believe we had good last three or four years. This year we expect that there is going to be some more economizing in those market. They are just because of the tightness of the budget situations in Texas, I think 40% of the school districts in Texas are running a  deficit in the school budget. So, there are some challenges there."
Jim Nazareth,Dennis Kakures,Okay. Thanks. And just to better understand the dynamic in California as far as -- you mentioned that money has been at least deployed the $13 billion or so of bonds that have been issued. But they've been slow to reach the school districts. Exactly -- is that eminent or is that -- what exactly is driving the holdup there?," Yeah. Its just administratively just how things work in the state and I am not sure about all the $13 billion, I am sure of -- I am aware of that the $2 billion of funding --about a $2.4 billion of school related. It just takes time sometimes and also now the federal stimulus monies, the first are batch of those monies, my understanding is are to be out to the school districts by May 15. So that's another --. California on the education side, I think its looking at about $6 billion and they are going to get a certain percentage of that here by in the middle of May, at least what's been planned. But this is all administrative processes that just take time."
Jim Nazareth,Keith Pratt,And for California the budget issues does that at all affect stimulus dollars coming into the State or is it and we should think of them completely separately?," I believe there are separate items. Now the fact here, the dynamic is such though that the school district is receiving federal stimulus monies and for whatever reason the May 19th initiative don’t pass they may decide to spend those monies on different types of items. So it may alter some of their spending behavior but there are other independent items."
John Gibbon,Keith Pratt," Just walk me through, I got two, three questions about how these different states operate. Just walk me through the initiatives that are in trouble?",There are only six initiatives and about five are the ones that are really key.
John Gibbon,Keith Pratt,Right.," And the best way to break it down here is because I am going just go through my notes just to make certain I don’t miss any salient points here. But if you look at propositions 1A and 1B which are really critical, they really established this rainy day fund for the State and in effect what it does is 1A would extend -- there are three new taxes that were put in place. We have a license fee tax, there was a state personal income tax increase and the sales tax increase. So those three items are in place but they were temporary. This would extend that for I believe four years and then it creates additional revenue in 1B then provide the shot in the arm to school districts to basically get -- it’s a one time infusion of $9.3 billion that's paid over five years beginning in the 2011-2012 school year. So, needless to say those are very, both of those are tied at the hip and if 1A doesn't pass it, 1B doesn't matter."
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures,You said they were behind in the pool?," Yeah, they are behind on the pools, but all five are behind in their pools now. If you want to hear about the others, I'll summarize the other three very quickly. The other is three 1C, 1D and 1E in effect provide more of an immediate pop here and the fact that it allows -- 1C basically is a securitization of the state lottery system. And allows a base of about $5 million in one time event for the state to be able to use right away. And then 1D and 1E are some other mixing the math in borrowing. Its very smaller relative, so that's an immediate pop and whereas 1A and 1B are longer term, but…"
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," Let me kind of turn to other states, I think I've always understood California, but this is usual California awareness but Florida, they don't have anything quite like this. I know a lot of those schools are still funded by local funding."," I'm sorry, in Florida?"
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures,Florida yeah. What’s happened in Florida which is very unusual.,Its both in Florida. They have local sales tax revenue there and you also get operating funds from the state.
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," But there's nothing based on real estate taxes right, Florida?",Now which state would your be?
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," Because you are saying that in Florida, they're reducing the valuations for both commercial and residential real estate dramatically, so it's going to reduce the tax base, which funds all kinds of services in every community there. I am stunned to what's happening. Now let me ask you about Texas. Does Texas have both a state and a local funding situation, because you say, that 40% of the school districts in Texas are running deficits. How they make up deficits in Texas? Taxes do quite….?"," While Texas -- that is three years ago, lower property taxes is down to quite a low level, and that's really starting to impact the school districts there. So they both -- they get state funds and they have local fund so."
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," And presumably both of these states will get something, not as very large, but something from the stimulus program?",Yes.
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," That's perfect, okay."," Yeah. They will definitely get something, but it's challenging. Texas right now, in fact their numbers increased, they are adding about 80,000 new students a year. And they are basically -- I think their funding levels are currently at about 2006 levels if I am not mistaken on the most recent articles that I have read. So, based upon the property they will when they lowered property taxes."
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," Eventually this has to play right in your hand, eventually?"," Well, we've seen an uptick in our Texas business over the last three to four years, so there are some impact there, we'll have to see what happens going forward."
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," Just so s you have this and this is more anecdotal than anything else, but I gather, this stimulus money is effecting other kinds of business, they may affect -- eventually affect your commercial [total] rental business. Because I have already heard from a couple of companies that projects, which are having to do with asphalt concrete structure, they have already started and their prices have firmed up on those things. So that, it will infrastructure part of the spending even though it has not arrived yet, the suppliers are beginning to see the signs of that. Now you hear that's early than what you see, but they are signs of it anyway?"," We very well are benefit from some of the federal money but perhaps more importantly the $30 billion in state infrastructure bonds that was passed November of 2006, we saw some impact from that last year and we would expect if the state is able to sell bonds, we'll see more of those types of infrastructure projects in a reserve waste water treatment plants, dams, bridges. Those types however, are in fact good for our commercial business and larger complexes."
John Gibbon,Dennis Kakures," Somebody is expecting that money for sure, because I am hearing it around in the infrastructure companies?",I would agree with your thinking.
