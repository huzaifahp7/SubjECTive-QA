Hamed Khorsand – BWS Financial,Per-Olof Loof," First one is, how immediate is it that you can see a benefits to the gross margin line from this vertical integration?"," Next fiscal year? I mean, we’ve got to close it first. I mean, we got to – so we expect to close in March and this is a current supplier. So we’re not talking about qualifying. So we will see benefits come in the second half of next fiscal, and overall, it will be about three gross margin points for the year."
Hamed Khorsand – BWS Financial,Per-Olof Loof,Would you be then basically taking all your Tantalum or from the Congo and then sending it over into Niotan to become powder?," Yet to be determined. We think that the Congo has as we improve that activity and ensuring that we can do it comfort free, it could be a significant supplier for us. Yes."
Hamed Khorsand – BWS Financial,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And as far as inventory goes in the channel, how many weeks of inventory is right now in the channel? What do you think your – the goal is?"," I think the goal of our distribution partners is typically to be have a turn, the turn to be between three and four, typically what they want. The catalog guys will probably want to be a little below that, and so they are fighting to get to that level and that we can see as I mentioned, one of our (inaudible) partners saw a quite a bit of burn in Europe right now, and so that's a positive sign. So I think we have another quarter of rebalancing activities in the channel at least maybe slipping into Q1 of our fiscal next year as well. But it’s happening..."
Marco Rodriguez – Stonegate Securities,Per-Olof Loof," Hi, one of the follow-up in regard to the Niotan acquisition. So, given some of the commentary you had in your prepared remarks, I mean, is it clear that you are kind of done with the vertical acquisitions there?"," In Tantalum, yes."
Marco Rodriguez – Stonegate Securities,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And then, as a bit of a follow-up in terms of the supply of that powder to you, assuming a normalized demand environment, would you basically outsourced all of your supply from them or you still need outside sources?"," No. We’re going to continue to use our other suppliers as well to some degree. But clearly, we will move more over to that than we otherwise probably would of course."
Marco Rodriguez – Stonegate Securities,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And then lastly, if you could provide a little bit more color obviously you said that you’re going to have about a 300 basis point improvement in gross margin for that segment. But you did comment that you would see some further improvements in the longer-term. Can you kind of help qualify what that might look like?"," Well, we think that the effect of next year’s activities would be, it’s going to take sometime to get started, may of course not be fully recognized. So I think you cannot completely double that, but it's going to be a significant improvement as we get the whole thing into full screen. So I'm not saying it's going to be 600 basis points, but it will be more than 300."
Marco Rodriguez – Stonegate Securities,Per-Olof Loof,As the long-term progresses?," Long-term, yes, absolutely, absolutely."
Per-Olof Loof,Anthony Kure – KeyBanc Capital Markets," Hi, good morning."," Hey, good morning gentlemen. Just a couple of questions on the book-to-bill numbers. Could you comment on what those were actually in January across the segments?"
Per-Olof Loof,"William M. Lowe, Jr.",Let me just give him…," So we are about – we’re a little below one overall, but a very differently between the different units. And basically Europe is closing in a one. Asia is a bit lower, but then again Asia has the New Year. So that you have a week more than a week, lot of activities there, so that affects that. And America was around one too – backup…"
Per-Olof Loof,Anthony Kure – KeyBanc Capital Markets," I think there is some disparity between the segments and we’ll see lead-time is being pretty stable now actually. Maybe increasing a little bit, but pretty stable."," Okay. And then as far as the restructuring, you had an announcement back in November sort of there is going to be obviously some restructuring savings in fiscal ‘13 and then more pushing to ’14. Can you review sort of the dynamics around that and thought process or just sort of the moving parts? And then maybe talk about what the expected savings are in fiscal ‘13 again and the expected savings in fiscal ‘14?"
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank,Per-Olof Loof," Hi, thanks. I just had a couple of clarification questions. On the SG&A comment, $25 million to $26 million next quarter, is that excluding the non-GAAP item? Should we use that in our model or would that, or would you exclude some stuff from that?"," Well, that’s probably above the non-GAAP number. it could be a little lower than that as we work through for the quarter, we’re working to reduce it, be it somewhere in the same range the other lower end of that range for the next quarter, but I would consider that to be the non-GAAP number."
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank,Per-Olof Loof,Okay.,We don't typically have too many things that run through SG&A that we’d backout for non-GAAP anyway.
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank,Per-Olof Loof," Okay, so that number goes up a bit versus where we are this quarter."," Well, just a little bit..."
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And then, typically you give operating margins for F&E in the Ceramics business, I know you give it for Tantalum. can you give us operating margins for F&E and Ceramics?"," The operating margins for ceramics, top of my head is about 20%, and the operating margin for F&E was slightly below that."
Sherri Scribner – Deutsche Bank,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And then in terms in the machining revenue that declined sequentially, can you give us a sense of how much it declined and know it was?",It declined about $5 million.
Unidentified Analyst,"William M. Lowe, Jr."," Good morning. Bill, I was hoping and I apologize to go back to this, if you could just clarify how would you say the benefit from the acquisition would be 3 basis points, but now it sounds like its 300 basis points to go..."," (Inaudible) its 300 basis points. When I’m talking about points I meant percentage, not the basis points."
Unidentified Analyst,"William M. Lowe, Jr."," And then, I guess I’m still trying to understand that seems like you cumulatively you’ll pay above $85 million for this deal. Just trying to understand like, how do we think about the return for this investment you’re making? I’m still a sort of struggling to see…?"," Well, I think Per’s comments said, two to three years payback."
Unidentified Analyst,"William M. Lowe, Jr.",Okay.," And of course that depends on about how volumes pick up here and what speed they pickup, but I think you can do the math on that one."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof," Yeah. And then, where exactly did you get this 300 basis point uplift from?",From the fact that we’re able to source at better prices of course.
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof,Okay.," And we can stabilize our supply and we can also lower the costs of this activity and that’s where the basis points, that’s where improvements come from."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof,Got it.," This has been part of our strategy for several years now, including the – starting with the manufacturing of wire, then making sure that Africa can work, and now the final one being our ability to control our own smelter. But we’re able to sell to our other customers as well; we’re not going to prevent our friendly competitors to buy from them as well of course."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof,Do you give any sense to what percentage of the overall market you will basically control with the Niotan acquisition?," That’s a difficult one to say. And we really don’t want to comment on that actually, because there are so many factors that will impact that. How other smelters react and what the market demand looks like and so forth and so on. And also what types of powders are going to be mostly in demand and so forth. So there are many factors that impact that, so it’s not a short one-line answer to that."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof," And Per, do you have just going to your segments quickly ceramic, tantalum, and F&E, do you know what ASP did in this three segments respectively?"," Yeah, ASP was pretty stable actually."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof,Is that quarter-over-quarter?," Quarter-over-quarter, yeah, we’re not seeing a lot of ASP version."
Unidentified Analyst,"William M. Lowe, Jr."," And then maybe just last one from me, like what explains like your ceramic gross margins very resilient, but we’re seeing quite a bit of weakening in tantalum and F&E. Maybe you can just help me understand the disparity in terms of margin performance across the three segments?"," Well, I think what explain the difference is the, what the product mix in ceramics that’s really the answer and we had a very positive product mix in this quarter."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof," Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I have a quick question on your cash flow from operations, what is your expectation for Q4?"," We didn't give you a cash flow expectation and just basically gave you a CapEx for the quarter. We've continued to generate cash and reduce inventory, but we're not providing a forecast actually for the cash flow for next quarter."
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. And then maybe let me ask you this. If you may maintain your current realization rates, what is your break-even EBITDA margin? It’s kind of get to a break-even cash flow from operations?",Break-even.
Unidentified Analyst,"William M. Lowe, Jr.",A lot of its…,Or from gross margin as it is easier...
Unidentified Analyst,Per-Olof Loof," Hi guys. Just a clarification and I think you did. I just wanted to confirm again going back to Niotan, the 300 basis point improvement. is that just in the Tantalum segment or where you implying (inaudible)?",That's tantalum.
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,Per-Olof Loof," Hi, Bill. Hi, Per. Can you comment on the acquisition, can you give us some sense of what the annual revenues were for Niotan?"," No, we can’t really, but it’s been one of our suppliers over the several years now and basically we will continue to – they will continue to serve their customer base, but of course we see this as an important step in securing our supply chain."
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,Per-Olof Loof," Okay. Thanks, so what percent of your current powder needs re-sourcing from Niotan and do you expect this acquisition to change that percentage?"," That’s not a public information, we don’t share that, but let’s assume that we will source more from Niotan now than we have in the past. But Niotan has been a significant supplier of ours. So it’s not a small in a couple of percentage a significant supplier."
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,"William M. Lowe, Jr.",Incremental would you need to re-qualify the powder with your customers and what’s sort of timeframe would that take?," There is no re-qualification required, since this is the current supplier."
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,Per-Olof Loof," Okay and again this might not be something that you might be able to share, but does Niotan source ore from non-Australian mines mostly or is it from Australia. I notice sourcing anything from the DRC?"," They actually source, they don’t source ore directly, they actually source KTaF, the second step of the process. So they’re not outsourcing from any of the mines. But clearly where we are laid out now with – the Make Africa Work program as we anticipate that we can actually have a close pipe system all the way from the mines into the smelter itself."
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,Per-Olof Loof," And just to clarify, did you say that there was three points of gross margin impact over the course of the next 12 months and do you see that changing over the longer-term?",That would improve over the long term.
Wamsi Mohan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,"William M. Lowe, Jr."," Okay, that’s helpful, Per. And then last one from me, what was the impairment of the $16 million in tantalum and the quarter related to?"," It was related to assets in our Evora, Portugal, facility that in our view is have been technologically outdated."
"William M. Lowe, Jr.","Matthew Sheerin – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.",Good morning.," So, couple of questions. There were some good details there, that was very helpful. In terms of the outlook for the quarter Bill, you talked about revenue in – I believe you said 205 to 210 range and lower gross margin. Does that mean you…"
"William M. Lowe, Jr.","Matthew Sheerin – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc."," Matt, let me just correct for this – I said, 200 to 210."," 200 to 210, okay, so 205 midpoint. And with some gross margin pressure again would you expect to post an operating loss in for the quarter, and higher SG&A?"
"William M. Lowe, Jr.","Matthew Sheerin – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc."," Yeah, with a higher SG&A, it’s possible. It’s going to be right around that red zero kind of number or just slightly below that possibly. We’ll work to keep put that – push SG&A down lower, but that’s our current forecast."," Okay. And in the press release, you talked about a couple of challenging quarters are ahead. I know there are some [semiconductor] suppliers and the semis tend to lead pass us by a quarter or two, but they’re already starting to see more positive book-to-bill and expectations for a bit of a snap back in the June quarter. Do you see that playing out in the June quarter or do you think that’ll still be relatively depressed for a couple of quarters?"
