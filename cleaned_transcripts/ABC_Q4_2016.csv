Steven H. Collis,Tim G. Guttman," Thanks, Bob, for the question. Yeah, firstly on Express Scripts, we don't – we're subject to negotiation. We've always tried to do more. We haven't really been successful. There's a new CEO there who we actually worked with when he was at Accredo. So we are always optimistic, but there's not going to be a big headwind from the renewal of this contract because at the moment, it's primarily brand, and we have been very successful in improving the overall scope of relationships in almost all of our contract renewals so one would hope that this would be the same. And then the second part of the question?"," Rite Aid, I mean..."
Steven H. Collis,Tim G. Guttman," Oh, the Rite Aid. Go ahead."," No, I would just say, I mean, I think our Drug company is excellent at execution. They're very good and onboarding customers. Certainly, that's a little premature, I mean, they – certainly, Walgreens has to get through FTC, but again, I think we would work hard and diligently to onboard as quickly as possible if they were successful."
Steven H. Collis,Barbara A. Brungess," Yeah. I just would add that – thanks, Tim – that WBA needs to honor its existing contract agreements, but it's not like we're not aware of what could occur again. We have been very planful. So thanks for the question, Bob.",Next question please.
Robert Patrick Jones,Steven H. Collis," Thanks for the question. Steve, I appreciate your comments on how there are differences between the three wholesalers' mix of customers, but I think many of us have operated under the assumption that the market's very efficient, just given the consolidated nature of the wholesale channel. So just trying to get a little bit more comfort around how more severe pricing commentary from your peers – seemingly more severe pricing commentary from your peers, wouldn't eventually be a reality for everyone in the industry?"," Yeah, I mean, we've got a lot of, we think, heavy lifting on our contracts behind us. We talk about – six months ago, I think we discussed this and we reflected in guidance, which we took very seriously. Of course, since then, the inflation rate in brands and deflation rate in generics has changed, but let me talk about it this way. I mean, my comments on – are I think very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen. I can't talk about the others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way. The environment is probably more challenging, and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You've got a lot going on the M&A side with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone is facing cost and efficiency challenges. And I would say our customers are more consolidated, more informed and have always been very sophisticated and quite adept at demanding value from us. And I think our industry has been responsive, and maybe we just haven't had as many tailwinds as we usually have, but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years. And we pointed in my script towards working within our customer base. So, I think that's a key point for us, and getting more compliance from those relationships. Tim, you want to add anything?"
Steven J. Valiquette,Steven H. Collis," Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Tim. So, there has been some mixed views on how much the earning sensitivity may be for drug distributors related to brand inflation. So, I guess just with your change in your view from what was 10% to 12% previously to 7% and 9%, is there maybe just any way to give a little more color on how much of a role that plays within your shift in the EPS growth from – Looks like about 4% to 6%, to 0% to 4% for fiscal 2017? Without getting too granular, just wondering is that a big part or a small part? Just any more color would be helpful. Thanks."," I'll let Tim comment, but I just would say, most of the growth has come from the specialty drugs, most of the unit growth, but they tend to be very expensive products, of course, not that many units. And then, there has been a relatively high rate, at least in 2015 of brand price appreciation, which was in the mid-teens. But, we saw it ramp down very significantly and current trends would indicate even a further step down. We do think that an overall industry growth rate is very helpful to growing our top line and our bottom line. But we're confident we can grow in this 6% to 9% range that we expect. We said 7% to 9%, but I'm just saying within 1% or 2%. If it comes a lot below that, we think that that will create some challenges that we will address, but we don't think that that's possible in the next 12 months. Tim, would you agree to that, anything to add?"
Garen Sarafian,Steven H. Collis," Good morning, Steve and Tim. I wanted to get back to the competitive landscape that's been such a big part of the conversation lately. First, just to be clear, are you maintaining the same pricing structure and strategy for your independents on a like-for-like basis? And secondly, you provided some commentary in the beginning, Steve, but you guys have always prided yourselves on having solid pricing data analytic capabilities. So any insights from the analytic work that you have done to sort of help us reconcile on what the various distributors are saying? Thank you."," I would say that the consolidation, although they don't acquire them, our independents are largely characterized – almost all of our independents now belong to buying groups. I came into the Drug company in 2009 and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in specialty, the wholesalers usually owned or were very involved in at least in oncology with our buying groups, and the same is true of say, Besse Medical. So, this is a function of the market, and for the most part we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups. That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example. So, as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high-teens generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last, because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing, and how that's going to change over, say, a nine-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that, you have to be thoughtful of that, because ABC is always thinking about the long-term and what does that nine year contract look like. And just because in the last nine years contracts have invariably improved, it doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same ways. And that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies, and that's a lot how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics, and then it's an important question. So, I'll let Tim also comment. But, as the groups consolidate, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts. But to the independent practice, we would say that 2,000 are very important, very critical, and that they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or, in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well. So those are the sort of discussions that we think are important. But they're not new. They've been going on for a long time. Any comments?"
Steven H. Collis,Ricky R. Goldwasser," Hi, Ricky."," Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the comments. I have a quick follow-up here. So, first of all, just to confirm, does guidance assume any new share gains from independent groups beyond what you already have gained year-to-date? That's first. And then my second question is if you can just give us a little bit more color on the branded inflation. I know in past quarter, I think, you mentioned that I think, now only 10% of your contracts with manufacturers are tied to or contingent on inflation. Can you maybe give us some more color on what percent of EBIT is tied to these agreements? Thank you."
Steven H. Collis,Tim G. Guttman," Our growth rate in independents – when we talked about it, I mean, we're talking about really growing by 1% or 2%, which is really just making sure we get our fair share of wallet with our contracted customers. We feel that we have mutual respect with the customers and we've given them we think fair pricing contracts and in return we should get all their generic compliance. And there has been some, you can call it interlopers in the market, where they come and maybe even slice off some brand products and that makes the generic compliance look better. We're saying to our independent customers, we want all your business. We're contracting with you. And that's where we've been focused. And those, I think, are very legitimate and bilateral discussions that we should have. And I think that's where we've made progress. As far as what the amount of brand contracts that are covered by fee-for-service, essentially all of our contracts are covered by fee-for-service. There are some where there's an outcome that could vary depending on the rate of inflation that they experience in their own portfolio. We are moving quickly to close that, as the market changes. So, we are in those discussions. We don't think that that reflects the current market, or the sort of bilateral mutually respectful agreements that we should have with our large branded manufacturers. So, those discussions are ongoing right now. Peyton Howell and her team are on it, and I think we're making progress there. But still more work to be done there for sure. Tim, anything to add?"," Yeah, we'll be consistent with what we said in the past. Typically, we've said that about 10% of our gross profit dollars are under those contracts that are – Steve talked about kind of the non-traditional, the type that are – have an element of price appreciation, and Steve mentioned we're working hard to reduce that number. So I think..."
Eric Percher,Steven H. Collis," Thanks. I think I'll follow the same line, but maybe a few items that were implicit, let's make explicit. So one item you mentioned that you look to gain share back with the lost buying group from 2015, was that effort limited in scale to APCI (55"," Yeah, I'll make a quick comment on each of those three. We did lose a buying group customer. It was a customer where a lot of the members were GNP members and a lot of them chose to stay with us. But I don't want to get too much into specifics. It's not that overall material. I think it's always interesting, lose a relationship with a – and I think it's a shared relationship, between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why that having long-term contracts is extremely important, so that we can work together on what – the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script. So I think actually that last year is a pretty good example of that and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC, but not – it's one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything, or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independents is very – I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we've signed. And we did work to try – keep some of those former buying group customers that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market, because again, people talk to each other. It's an efficient market, so we want to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the telemarketers, I would say are struggling a bit, because I think ourselves and our peer companies are looking at that compliance factor and have better tools to manage that. And there's not the growth that you had from so many new product launches. And I talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, no need for you to order from a telemarketer. We're going to get that product to you first. And that's one of the examples, Eric, of an enhancement we've made to our business. I think, Tim, I've covered everything. So we'll probably move on to the next question."
Lisa Christine Gill,Steven H. Collis," Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to go back, Steve, to your comment where you talked about different pricing strategy for specialty, and you have new long-term contracts now in place with a number of your customers. My understanding is that historically, it was a branded bucket, that specialty was included in a generic bucket, and now trying to break out specialty. Can you talk about what the new pricing strategy looks like? And am I correct in thinking that when it was in the branded budget, you were discounting that, similar to branded where maybe it's WAC minus 3%? And what could the new economics look like in the new separation of specialty?"," Yeah, Lisa, I mean, I'd say essentially you're accurate on my commenting on the WAC minus 3%, but you're essentially accurate. I mean, we had such a good surge in generic compliance and generic rates that maybe our industry was not as thoughtful about this as we should. And then we had that really fall off and specialty products increase so much, which are very expensive. And there is an argument with the manufacturer, there's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market-based fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult time, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend and we're working hard, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important weighting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that there's a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service. So it should be a differentiated brand markdown, to respond directly to your question."
Eric W. Coldwell,Steven H. Collis," Thanks very much, and a whole lot of mine have been covered, but I was hoping we could just get a data point that I think a lot of people have recently scrambled for, which is could Amerisource provide an update on the number of independent pharmacies that you work with, and maybe where that is today versus the past? And perhaps provide some definition around how you would include an independent GPO in that count. Just trying to get a sense on where independents are as a percent of your total revenue, or number of stores, or some additional metrics. Thank you."," We have a very tiered system. We haven't picked up a lot of new customers. It's essentially flat. Sometimes – we can't speak for what our buying group customers go to get new members. And they sometimes fold in smaller groups, but we're essentially flat. We think our market share might be – it depends on the different data points you use, but it's maybe stable to up 50 basis points. So we're not seeing anything really significant, except – the only big thing that happened to us in independents is that we were fairly successful in retaining some of the members of the buying group that we lost last year, and most importantly, we signed a long-term contract with CPA that is our largest buying group customer, and that we think is a leader in innovation and service. So, Tim, anything else?"
Charles Rhyee,Steven H. Collis," Yeah, thanks for the question. Steve, at the beginning, I apologize – I kind of missed a little bit – my phone was cutting in and out. But you were talking about these buying groups, and then – is it that you were saying that you were – you anniversaried sort of the new pricing that you're seeing in some of these long-term contracts, or was there still some more as you work with the actual members that that still has to filter through? Just to clarify. And then in terms of what you were just talking about in terms of your wallet share as a prime vendor, can you talk about how much that's changed over the last year or so, like kind of what kind of share of the wallet are you getting currently? And how much more room do you think there is for improvement? Thanks."," Well, I go back to our fiscal year 2016 planning process, and we looked at a small erosion that we'd experienced in the last few years in our GNP share of wallet. And we just – we said, okay – I mean, Tim and I sort of challenged Bob Mausch and our team. We said, listen, we're investing in Elevate, we're investing in business coaching, we're investing in First to Shelf. We've got our highest full (1"
Michael Cherny,Steven H. Collis," Good afternoon, guys. So, I think all the pharma questions have been answered. Maybe a little bit on PharMEDium and some of the performance there. You said you'd been thrilled with the integration. Can you just talk a little bit about how you can use that as a potential leading source to drive incremental revenue, incremental customer bases. Has that introduced you to any other new customers that you didn't already know?"," We can do better there. And in fact I was talking to one of our health systems VPs just this week. I feel we can do better there. It's about a year, and we've had some leadership changes there. I think we're very comfortable with the team. The focus at PharMEDium has really been on making sure that we maintain the high regulatory standards that FDA and others expect of us, and we're working very hard. And I think you'll see ABC and PharMEDium management team having the right orientation there. That's going to be very, very important to continue to lift the standards. So that's been a lot of the focus, and we've been through a lot of the integration. They have had some benefits from some new product launches. Their pricing there is definitely a different environment than the rest of the generic environment that we see. Their market share is very, very good. They work with 2,000 systems. And their biggest opportunity is really to just do more – a bigger share of wallet with their customers, but, their pricing is so differentiated than our overall health system GPO customers that we haven't really looked at integrated offerings. And probably shouldn't really, because it's not – you're sort of mixing apples and oranges. But we are always mindful of, absent the whole Wells Fargo mess, we're always mindful of cross-selling and looking for those synergies with customers. So, appreciate the question on PharMEDium. Thanks."
Greg Bolan,Steven H. Collis," Hey. Thanks, guys. Sorry. Hopefully I didn't miss this – a little late to the call. But, so, it sounds to me that the strategy towards the community pharmacy, independent pharmacy market really hasn't changed a whole lot. Sounds like – we know that obviously you guys have been trying to kind of steady your position there, reclaim market share over the past several years. And so I just wanted to kind of clarify that. And that's actually all I have. Thanks."," No, no, well said. I think we've given pretty exhaustive comment on it. I don't ever remember working so carefully on a script just to make sure that you get exactly that message, that ABC is being very thoughtful, very responsive or very planful reacting to an environment that's more challenging. And that's really our message for today. So we appreciate the question. Just – Barbara, I think I'll make my closing comments now. That was the last question."
