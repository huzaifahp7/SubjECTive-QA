Anthony Stoss,Rick Neely," Hi guys, just wondering if you are – what you are hearing from your customers in terms of order push-outs model that you guys were expected to be in, also if you could comment on the network market, has there been any share changes? And also if, Michael, if you can give us a sense of how many new products do you might launch in 2009? Thanks."," Okay, Tony, hi. I will start a little bit – the issues of the push-outs were a Q4 phenomenon that a lot of – when Michael said November, December what happened was all the orders that came in were matched by orders that got pushed out to the next quarter. So that was why the end of the year was bad for everybody in the business. We haven’t, after those push-outs there we haven’t seen as much of that this quarter. It sort of hit the bottom. But – so I don’t see any more of that right now. That was more a Q4 phenomenon. I will turn it over to Mike.",,,,,,
Anthony Stoss,Michael Hsing," Okay, and then also if one of you guys could comment on where you stand share any changes at all that you can tell?",No there is a – I think that the worst time is around too fast and customer hasn’t really reacted that. And as far as we see we haven’t lost any socket.,,,,,,
Dan Myers,Rick Neely," Hey, Rick, just a housekeeping issue. You gave non-GAAP OpEx of $12.5 million to $13.5 million and then litigation of $1.5 million to $2 million.",Correct.,,,,,,
Dan Myers,Rick Neely,Is the litigation inside the OpEx?," No, that’s additive. I mean the $12.5 to $13.5 million is your R&D, SG&A –",,,,,,
Dan Myers,Rick Neely," Okay, and so you don’t consider litigation as part of this – it’s – so we should look at a total of $14 million to $15.5 million?",Right.,,,,,,
Dan Myers,Rick Neely," Well, you’d like that litigation to be zero someday.",That’s exactly my point. You got it.,,,,,,
Doug Freedman,Rick Neely," Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your results, DC to DC converters down 20%, really outperformed the LED business there, the – backlighting business. Can you talk a little bit about what contributed to sort of relative strength in DC to DC or are you seeing new wins that are starting to ship in sample volumes or is it just that the end market that that sells into weren’t down as much or there wasn’t as much inventory? What explanation can you offer?"," Well part of it, Doug is – as Michael talked on the new products – but part of it like we said, we generated 10 – over $10 million of new product revenue in 2008 from MiniMonsters and battery charges that was zero in the year before. So that helped contribute with those types of new products. Michael?",,,,,,
Doug Freedman,Michael Hsing,Great. Can you talk a little bit about sort of tracking your design wins and maybe a little bit more color on the relative value of the design wins that you’ve achieved in the last quarter?," In the last quarter, in the DriverMOS and obviously the new product that we beta tested in many customer place. And we had very good feedback. Our customers are excited about it and so we are continuing to work with them and try to get some design wins. That’s one area. The other area lower current levels, 4-5 amp current levels and we are designing into many different places and if I mention one of them it will be a small percentage. So I just mention one just for information. Again, the TV, okay, we continue to win design wins in the TV side set top box in Europe and among other industrial applications. So, every one of them are very – contributes to very small revenues.",,,,,,
Gus Richard,Michael Hsing," Yes, thanks for taking my question. Michael, can you characterize the designing activity that you are doing currently? Is it mostly for new products or is it more for cost reductions for existing products?"," It’s not a cost – okay, actually we do both. And – but I have to correct my – correction to your question is that okay, it’s not a cost reduce and cost it’s – we increase the dollar content to replace our existing product. Our product especially in the DC to DC and our unit price will slightly increase and to cannibalize our older generation. The reason we can do that is because we need to bring in more components. The newer product, of course, and I am excited about the DriverMOS family and this opens up another market, which we don’t – we didn’t have before.",,,,,,
Gus Richard,Rick Neely," Okay and then Rick, just a couple of quick ones. Currently the order rate is very spotty. Is that just the fact that customers are ordering from just immediate need and you know even if they don’t kind of thing?"," I would say that’s correct. I mean what you saw obviously in January was quite because everybody was on vacation either in the U.S. or when we got back everyone went on vacation for Chinese New Year. So, yes, we’ve seen some more regularity in February, but again, it’s just a few weeks. So, I think given the situation of the ODMs and so forth I think they are ordering when a customer screams at them and they order from us. But it’s pretty much hand and mouth as far we can tell. That’s why it’s erratic.",,,,,,
Ian,Michael Hsing," Hi guys, this is Ian [ph] in for Craig. Can you talk a little bit about, I think Michael you made the comment that you are seeing more opportunity because of this dislocation. Can you talk a little bit about where that is either by channel or customer or product?"," I think our business is 80% to 90% is (inaudible) own design. Our channels don’t do that design, okay, and is all MPS. It’s actually across the board. And from industrial application and set top boxes and even TV so we so lot more demand. And from the – particularly from – not, sorry, not demand, the design win – the designing activity and particularly from these – the product that we released in the second half of last year.",,,,,,
Ian,Rick Neely," Okay, thanks. And then just Rick, with the cash moving up, can you tell us how you are thinking about buybacks and sources and uses of cash in 2009? Thanks."," Well, we did one in last year, but this is the year where everyone – cash is king, so we are going to keep our $150 million this year till we see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. So we don’t have any plans to do that this year.",,,,,,
Johnny Brown,Michael Hsing," Hey, Rick and Michael, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that you are 90% booked to the low end of guidance currently. I was wondering if you’d be willing to give your lead times. I imagine they are pretty low right now. So where are those running currently?"," It varies and the order that we got in the last few weeks or few days, are rush orders.",,,,,,
Patrick Wang,Michael Hsing," Yes, hey guys. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions here. First, hey, can you talk a little bit more about inventories here just I guess expectations is as if – if your channel inventory does get any leaner from this point, then also if you can give us I guess what finished goods and maybe quantify the reserves you guys took last quarter."," Yes, in a normal climate I’ve said it many times – I said many times before that our inventory level is not usually related to our future business and sometimes we strategically pile up more inventory than other. So this time in – our inventory in the channels are extremely low and we may or may not increase and depend on if we – - depend on our customers – our customers’ demand. So at this time it’s not clear.",,,,,,
Patrick Wang,Michael Hsing," Okay. And also just to get some clarification, I guess, Mike, on your comment there so is it fair to say that a lot of the inventory burn in the channel is over with at this point?"," Yes and they declined slightly from the last quarter and so – but we want to and we believe, always believe, we can manage inventory a lot better than our distributors. And so we still keep them lean and so at the same time we’ll try to find out what’s our customer demand.",,,,,,
Patrick Wang,Rick Neely," Okay, got you. And as my follow-up here, I just want to ask you a little bit more about gross margins here. I know that I guess Richard said that was it – about three or four points was lower due to the inventory reserves and under utilization. If we think about Q1 gross margins here, and I know that you said that a lot of that’s due to under utilization here. Beyond that, if we were to back out the charges in Q4, we get to kind of like 61-ish gross margin. Is that the fair normalized level to think about for Q2 and beyond?"," Yes, maybe I read it too quickly, but part of my script was that our base line gross margins remained about the same. So if you took what the – take away the extraordinary capacity or inventories we’d be 61-62 without those extraordinary situations.",,,,,,
Rick Schafer,Michael Hsing," Hey guys, I had a couple of questions for you following up I guess the first is just on – I know you – just a little more color maybe on eh order patterns you guys have seen since October. I know – Michael I know you have mentioned it’s gotten better this year but since Chinese New Year, could you give us an idea sort of the magnitude of the uptick in bookings or is – or what you’re trying to say is that bookings are just declining at a less bad rate or they are becoming less bad. I mean how do we think about your order patterns?"," It is much less bad compared with November or December. The November-December is in a – particularly December is going backwards. And now in January and as I’ve said after Chinese New Year the orders go forward. We had a pretty good bookings Richard can talk about it, but still the booking rate is still very erratic, as I’ve said.",,,,,,
Rick Schafer,Michael Hsing," Okay, so you usually give us number I mean can you give us an idea of the like sort of the level of turns you need to make let’s say the midpoint of the top line guidance."," Yes, we usually don’t give any details, but this is unprecedented and I think it’s – we should tell our shareholders lot more clear. We have currently about – the booking at the 90% our lower end – lower end of our guidance. But we – it’s very difficult to – for us to forecast what’s next week, because as I said very erratic.",,,,,,
Rick Schafer,Rick Neely," Okay. That’s great and then – okay, so that’s great. And then just a second question. You’ve done a nice job cutting costs so far and kind of keeping up with the revenue declines, but I mean it seems like ’09 revs are probably tracking to little more than $100 million this year give or take I guess, which is similar to a couple of years ago. I guess what would you guys need to see to sort of take a harder look at cutting cost or how much could you really cut from here without jeopardizing future growth? Can – any kind of idea of magnitude or do you quantify that at all?"," Well, I’ll start off and then Mike will probably finish it. I mean as you can see from the decline in operating expense, we have a large variable component to our expenses, primarily bonuses. We have some obviously moves we took, we had a shutdown in December, that helped out. We have (inaudible) travel down like most people, but primarily it’s our bonuses and so what you see in Q1 if you look at our guidance, Rick, that reflects pretty much no bonuses. We operate in Silicon Valley unlike some other companies, I guess. We don’t make any money, we don’t pay any bonuses. So that’s what Q1 reflects. However, if business picks up we’ll – we will pay some bonuses if it picks up. If it doesn’t, we won't. So I don’t really know how to answer your question of trend. I can just tell you in quarter like Q1 where it looks like we will be marginally profitable we don’t pay any bonuses and that helps operating expenses. In terms of how long we would have to go to make any structural changes, Michael can probably speak to that.",,,,,,
Rick Schafer,Rick Neely," Okay. And then just one last question I guess on the P&L. Rick or Michael, do you guys anticipate a further inventory charge in the first quarter? I mean you said gross margin will be below the target range a little bit again. Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of how much below maybe and if it’s just – is it just reflecting under utilization or is it also – is there a further inventory charge coming?"," Yes, the inventory charge will depend on how demand looks for the future. The primary outlook right now is under utilization as – as you know our test here in Chengdu, most any test areas are very heavily fixed cost and a lot of the machines in there and depreciation. So, it doesn’t matter whether you run them or not, there is a certain amount of cost. And that’s reflected in the – the gross margin impact this quarter is primarily going to be from the model is primarily capacity utilization. We would expect that to turn around of course, as business picks up.",,,,,,
Sukhi Nagesh,Rick Neely," Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Rick, just a couple housekeeping questions here. What does your – what do you expect the interest income and your tax expenses for the first quarter?"," The tax rate for the year we expect to be between 10% to 12% although that depends on profitability. If we don’t make any money, your tax rate will drop real bad. If – on interest income, unfortunately treasury rates are quite low and overall interest rates are low. So we would expect to probably decline. Even though our cash balances are larger the interest income percentage is lower. So we probably are right now looking at less interest income in ’09 than ’08.",,,,,,
Sukhi Nagesh,Rick Neely," Okay. That’s helpful. And then on the revenue segment for the first quarter if you were to rank the three segments that you usually give out, how would you rank them in terms of which one would be better than expected – better than the other segments."," Well the – of the three segments, as you noticed even from this year where we grew DC to DC 32% and the Company average was 20%, almost all of our new products in the last few years and all of our technology expansion has been in the DC to DC area. It’s also the area which is a $6 billion market for power management. We have a long ways to go to continue to gain market share. Backlighting, which was our traditional market, that was the first market for the Company, is a smaller, more restricted market, and that’s flattened out and we didn’t expect much there. We expect most of the growth in DC to DC.",,,,,,
Sukhi Nagesh,Rick Neely,Got it. And then a follow-up to that. Are the margins in DC to DC better than CCFL? And how should that – how should the mix play out?," It depends. The newer products tend to have better margins but older products, even an older DC to DC product; we tend to have margin compression. So, it’s more of a mix issue than not. As CCFL products tend to be older, their margins tend to be a little bit lower. And that’s another way to look at it.",,,,,,
Tore Svanberg,Michael Hsing," Yes, thank you. First question, just coming back to the (inaudible) bookings I realize it’s erratic, but any area that’s relatively performing better than others at this point."," No, we have a pulling and some new products in – across the – or our across product family. And these are just spikes.",,,,,,
Tore Svanberg,Michael Hsing," Very good. And Michael on the 8698, which you just launched, seems like a pretty good product, and you mentioned graphic servers and notebook as a house for that product, but which of those three would you start to see the first revenue and when would you actually materialize the revenue?"," This product is only for the – is the first product we released in a family, which is for the notebook application. We have other products for servers and graphics cards. So the revenue I expected will be from notebook first.",,,,,,
Tore Svanberg,Michael Hsing," Great. And lastly on the legal expenses, they continue to be quite lumpy, so how do we model – how should we model those expenses going forward.",It’s always very difficult and Tore you know and you have been with us for – cover us for many years. The legal expense is really controlled by the court and by our outside lawyers and I really can't – can't really give you a very accurate description and so – we just leave it like $1.5 million to $2 million in first quarter.,,,,,,
Tore Svanberg,Rick Neely," Fair enough. And then just lastly on the gross margin and without the – an inventory – a potential inventory or non-inventory reserve this quarter, gross margin will still be up sequentially, right, Rick?",Are you talking Q4?,,,,,,
Tore Svanberg,Rick Neely," No, in Q1. So –"," Q1, I mean the biggest issue in Q1, Tore is some under utilization capacity and we have our test facilities mostly in fixed cost, it’s mostly a building with a bunch of machines and so you’ve got that cost whether you run them or not. So, the biggest impact to gross margin this quarter is the – three or four points on the capacity side assuming we get back to a normalized run rate soon that will go back up.",,,,,,
Vernon Essi,Rick Neely," Thanks for taking my question and I apologize for beating a dead horse here on gross margin gain, but I just want to ask a point of clarification. Rich are you saying you are not going to have any reserve charges in the first quarter."," Well, no, I said I don’t know.",,,,,,
Vernon Essi,Rick Neely," You don’t know, I am sorry, okay."," So, that’ why we guided where we did. So I – if you look at just the numbers, remember what we are doing – you just take the midpoint of our guidance, it’s about half of what we were doing six months. So obviously our factory, we can't downsize it by half. So, there is three or four points. About three points that hit the gross margins from that. There may or may not be any change in inventory reserves, I just don’t know. It’s a four month forward look for us and we do it. We’ll figure that out when we get to the end of the quarter.",,,,,,
Vernon Essi,Rick Neely," Okay, sure understand that. Thanks for clarifying. And I’ve heard your comments on this but how did pricing hold up and what’s your outlook on sort of how things are out there in terms of environment."," Well, Michael will answer that one.",,,,,,
Vernon Essi,Michael Hsing," Okay. So you mean you’ve always been pretty good at balancing that on the foundry side. So you are in a zone where you feel that’s not slipping faster on the pricing side versus your cost side, correct?"," No, I said that that foundry side, of course, they are in a very empty too, so they really want like any other company want us to starting wafers and with a favorable cost, and the same times our customers also ask the price down. And so – but my point is that the new product that we’ve released in the last – second half of last year, usually will contribute the – to a favorable gross margins but in – during this times we can't really see whether – how, we can't really predict how fast our customer would adapt To the new solutions.",,,,,,
Vernon Essi,Michael Hsing," Okay. And then just my last question here. If you were to rank your end target markets in 2009, trying to – if you can work through the noise level of an inventory rebuild, what would the – would you sort of say would be your top end markets going into the end of 2009 from a demand perspective? I mean I am trying to get a gauge here on your design activity. I mean where do you see the most robust dollar content opportunities right now?"," Obviously – we can't increase our notebook content from a year ago from last year maybe a couple of dollars and get to $5-$6 and we keep increase the content in TV fro $3 or $4 to even more $6 to $7. And the (inaudible) area and we have a new DriverMOS product and we are expecting doing well and start to – start second half of this year’s or early next year. So, I don’t know if you – if I answered your question.",,,,,,
Vijay Rakesh,Michael Hsing," Yes, hi guys. I am just – you just said the litigation expense was kind of a wild card here. But as we look out for the year do you have any idea of – do you expect this to kind of flat for a couple of quarters. I know there is – I mean do we have a court date or do you expect that span two quarters?"," The court days – the problem in my experience, the court days always change and so I – and it really then depends on the court days and so I can't really give you like which quarter is how much.",,,,,,
Vijay Rakesh,Rick Neely,Okay. So conservatively kind of hold it steady for a couple of quarters is what I think?," Yes, yes.",,,,,,
Vijay Rakesh,Michael Hsing," And when you look at your product segments I know you said you had a couple of wins in TV on the CCFL side and TVs for the year, but most of the traction is on the DC to DC side. So for the year do you expect exiting the year kind of DC to DC kind of to be much higher like 75% to 80% of revenues and the audio should be significantly lower from where it is as a mix?"," From – yes, from the past history, that’s the trend and we – majority of our product introduced in the last year is mostly are – these are DC to DC products. Yes, your assumption is correct.",,,,,,
Vijay Rakesh,Rick Neely," Got it. And one last question here is obviously with the kind of the macro the top line is coming down a little bit, and pretty much in line with peers. But how can we get some leverage in the model. I know (inaudible) rate is coming down but the litigation is going up a little bit but where else do you have the – what levers do you have with the model to get some earnings leverage?"," Well the main thing we are doing we are controlling what we can. We made major steps in dropping our operating expenses. We dropped inventory, we improved our working capital. So we are doing all the right financial moves we can do. That’s a thing that affected everybody is if nobody is buying cars from Toyota or electronic products from Sony, we are not going to sell any chips either. So, the problem with the worldwide demand is affecting everybody. So what we – we can't affect the top line near term. That’s the situation. So we are trying and take a leverage where we can control it. We are keeping our costs lean and dropping off the excess, that’s what we can do.",,,,,,
