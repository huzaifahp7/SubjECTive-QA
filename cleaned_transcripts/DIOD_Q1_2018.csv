Gausia Chowdhury,Emily Yang," Hi, good afternoon. This is Gausia Chowdhury on behalf of Shawn. Congrats on a solid quarter and guidance. First off, can you give the POS versus POP? I think you said POS is down slightly. Could you give more details, please?"," Yeah. So, this is Emily. So, our POS is down slightly compared quarter-to-quarter. POP also down slightly quarter-to-quarter, that's based on our guidance. So that's how we look at the inventory level as well, right? So, still within our range as defined normal between 11 to 14 weeks.",,,,,,
Gausia Chowdhury,Emily Yang," Okay, thank you. And then can you reconcile your view on the auto and industrial strength that you're seeing given the weakness that was cited by some of your peers. And then also your view on Pericom within these markets. Are you still bullish for 2019? Any further detail will be helpful. Thank you."," Right. So, if we look at automotive market overall, the consensus is actually from the demand point of view is down. So, where Diodes is actually gaining is really based on the past demand creation effort and also the content expansion. So even though the overall market is down, we're still seeing very good growth rate, 7% quarter-over-quarter, 23% year-over-year growth. So, that's specifically related to automotive. And then related to Pericom, we're also seeing a significant growth contributing to our Q1 revenue and we expect that growth will continue into 2019 and the rest. This is really based on the demand creation pipeline and also the information that we received from the content expansion point of view.",,,,,,
Tristan Gerra,Keh-Shew Lu," Hi, Dr. Lu. During the earnings call, I think it was in October of last year, Rick was highlighting the potential for Diodes to reach 38% gross margin by the second half of this year. And then it sounded like your outlook for gross margin early this year was more muted to about 36%. Today, your Q2 gross margin guidance is 38%. That's even ahead of last year expectation. And at the time one could contend that the end demand environment was stronger than what you're seeing today. So I know you mentioned Europe and automotive but could you go more into details about the catalyst for gross margin? What makes it better than you saw it earlier this year? Maybe quantify how big Pericom is as a percent of revenue and how sustainable you think this gross margin outlook is into the second half?"," Okay. Tristan, you know I've been emphasizing if we grew the automotive and industrial revenue, automatically the gross margin will be improving better than our expectations. And so you can see the result, automotive, while the market went down, our sequential still go up 7% and year-over-year is at 20s high, 28%. So you can see the effort due to the past design win plus the company increase as I have been mentioning to you several times. This strong growth has enabled us to reach 10% - now 10% of our revenue and we continue to improve the automotive performance. And that is the one key thing to improve the gross margin better than expected. Another one is the industrial. Now this quarter, industrial is 29% of our total revenue. It is an indication of a significant growth in the industrial area for Diodes. While the market kind of slowed down and that's you're seeing through other people's earnings conference calls, industrial is actually slowed down a little bit, but for Diodes, we continue gaining the market share. So if you look at my long-term strategy, I've been talking about I want to improve the industrial and automotive to 40% of our revenue. We already reached to 39% and we'll continue our long-term goal of getting higher and higher automotive, industrial - industrial applications. And this will enable us to continue improve our gross margin. One more thing, due to our Pericom acquisition, our Pericom products result in the frequency control or those kind of the IC products contribute a significant growth, contribute to our margin. If you remember, our Pericom products typically have a 50% GP or higher. And so, if that sector grows very faster, then it again enables us to exceed our gross margin guidance. And if you look at the Pericom product concentrate on the data center, cloud computing and servers and automotive applications, all those is good and big growth effort for us and contribute better than average growth in Diodes' business. So, I'm still very confident we will continue effort to benefit from these three key areas, reaching high GP and change our product mix towards the high GP products. Even if we get some pressure from the low-end commodity type of product and the price pressure is there but due to our effort on the other market segments I mentioned, then our GP still able to continue improving.",,,,,,
Tristan Gerra,Emily Yang," That's very useful. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, the market share gains, we can certainly see that and understand it's in automotive because your ramp started or your exposure in autos have been smaller than some of your peers but in industrial, you do have a very meaningful percent exposure. So what would you say at a high level is driving the share gain? Is that packaging? Is it pricing? Any particular sector that you could emphasize."," I think - this is Emily, let me address the question, right. I think it's really about content expansion, right? So, even the market may not be growing from the total demand point of view but we've seen significant content expansion within that industrial area, right? The leverage between the Diodes and also the Pericom product line that we've seen are significant push in this area for us.",,,,,,
Gausia Chowdhury,Keh-Shew Lu," Hi, again. Can you talk a little bit about the TI fab acquisition? What is associated with that within your guidance? And then any details you might be able to provide on the expected accretion or impact to margin or OpEx would be helpful. And then also having to do with the acquisition, how does the fab affect your CapEx profile? Thank you."," Okay. The TI acquisition, one of the elements is we will provide TI with a wafer supply agreement, but it's immaterial or is not material. So, it's not big compared with our Diodes' revenue. Okay? Second, we keep emphasizing it's accretive, even their margin is not as high as our average, but it's accretive to our business. And we're going to use and we are, like I mentioned, we are aggressive now to qualify our own process because we want to use it to support our future growth. Okay? So we are kind of pretty tight on our wafer supply and we have a lot of wafer need to outside and control by other foundry business, foundry people. So what we want to do is increase, again our own supply. So it's helping us in the future for the growth.",,,,,,
