Alexander Klein,Shane O’Leary," Good morning, gentlemen. Just a few questions here. Just wondered if you could give us some color on the production that was curtailed here in Q2, as a result of the pump failures and workovers, where did this occur and how much production was actually curtailed? And then as a follow up, is that production back online now and if not, why not and when will it be?"," Okay. I’ll address that. In Argentina, we are down about 200 barrels a day, that’s just due to accessing service rates and weather conditions that have been bad in the areas we are producing, so access has been an issue. In Columbia, C-1 went down and we had to work over and recomplete that as well and we lost. That was quite a significant well, lost about 1000 barrels a day there. And J-1 has been declining due to scaling problems and so we’ve had to work over that rig. Some of these workovers have led us to the conclusion that we need to be able to access more than one service rates, which we – the only one, we currently have been working in our area. And that’s proving to be an inadequate. And then, of course, the OTA was down for seven days and although that was for a very long period, when you start averaging sub sounded, it hurts. So, okay, backup and J-1 is being worked over, we decide to frac at that well at the same time, so it’s taking a little bit longer to get back online and C-1 has been re-completed. And so we’re fully expecting to – on a yearly average basis, produce within our guidance from 14 to 16,000 barrels today corporately.",,,,,,
Alexander Klein,Dana Coffield," Okay. Thank you. And just follow-up on the exploration side, with regard to Pacayaco and Costayaco East-1, from a geological perspective these similar kinds of, structures to Moqueta and Costayaco. Are you targeting the Caballos and Villeta reservoirs? Can you give us a little color on that please?"," All the prospects in the Putumayo portfolio are targeting these reservoirs. The prospects where the structures are all similar and trying to reverse those, the Costyaco East is actually a different type of truck. It’s a footwall truck, relying on the plateau [ph]. It doesn’t, after all consistent, cut back at same reservoir, same oil wells…",,,,,,
Alexander Klein,Dana Coffield," So given the success at Costyaco and preliminary success at Moqueta, do you see the probability of success of those two wells being higher than they’d normally it would be or were they completely independent?",They are independent.,,,,,,
Alexander Klein,Dana Coffield," So what are we looking at, 20% chance of success?"," Individual cross explorations, 20% to 40% chance of success. The average program is probably around 13.",,,,,,
Alexander Klein,Dana Coffield,Okay.,30%.,,,,,,
Cristina Lopez,Shane O’Leary," Hi guys. Just a couple of quick questions, one is with respect to the capacity from the Guayuyaco line to Morado [ph] where you have sufficient capacity with new discoveries on the Chaza Block or are you looking at now on expansion as well from (inaudible) that was the big bottleneck."," If we make modest discovery or small discovery, what we probably knew is that expand our trucking capacity. If we have to make a large discovery then we would twin existing pipeline. Those two segments, we may twin one or both depending on the scale of a new discovery. Any breakeven in say field side that would trigger that is kind of grey area that twins on productivity and floor rate and such. Just, despite to say that was a small discovery, we would just expand trucking capacity, large discovery; we would have to twin the pipeline.",,,,,,
Cristina Lopez,Dana Coffield," And I may have missed the answer to this one, but it seems like there is a Sarbanes-Oxley, the Argentina Caballos, I’m just curious is that just cost over runs on the workover on the Valle Morado Block or if it is related to something different?",This is higher. This is costly sidetrack. It is higher than we originally budgeted as one item and then we’re doing additional facility upgrading of the gas processing plant. And those numbers are higher than we originally budgeted.,,,,,,
Cristina Lopez,Dana Coffield," And then finally in Peru, with the delays in receiving the EIA approval then drilling. Do you expect now that you will some of the seismic interpreted for the 2-D seismic or is it going to be just to start wells drilled off the Rio Mag."," No. We’ll have some of the seismic interpreted, but it won’t influence the location of the wells. That’s being redefined with the environmental furnace we have.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary," Yes. Good morning, everyone. Referring to the shortfall of Q2 over Q1 with respect to production, I just want to explore a couple of things, how much did the pipeline shutdown contribute to the shortfall? I mean, obviously, seven days storage on a gross basis could amount to something like a 125,000 barrels. But how much storage was in fact available to you, so that you could basically store your production and then subsequently evacuated?"," There wasn’t that much storage. I think, we were able to produce for about two days and then we had to shut-in.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary," Okay. The obvious follow-up would be, do you guys plan to add any further this spoke storage to cater for such events. I mean, those seven-day shut-in, I know, that the intervention on this pipeline have been reduced in frequency of late, but nevertheless, shut-in are shut-in, would you plan to add any storage?"," No. I don’t think so, I think, we’re comfortable with the level of storage we have and as you mentioned, this incident seem to be coming fewer in frequency than more so also.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary," Okay. And you did speak about the – the question regarding the nature of the recompletion and work hours, and you spoke to that. But, I guess, my question would be, given that, well, of this past, are any of these wells recompletion associated with depletion of the Villeta sands. Are you opening up any fresh sands at Costayaco and did that form any part of the recompletions in Q2?",No.,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary,Or they were all caused by problems with wells?," Yeah. Expect for, we did open up with C-11, we opened up a new area of the field but not with the recompletion, no.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary," Okay. I think, well, in fact, that forms a question. What is – can you speak to what production you’re getting from C-11, because is that coproduction with both sands?"," No. It’s only producing from one sand, its producing about 1000 barrels a day and it’s only going to be briefly because we did drill that’s to be an injector. And but we didn’t, if you start injecting water right away, you’re going to be stranding some reserves. So, we’re trying to deplete a little bit of the area, before we start injecting water to get the benefit of the oil in that area. So it will just be a temporary thing.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Shane O'Leary," Okay. And temporary, meaning, what a matter of months?"," Yes. Say two months, something like that.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield," Okay. And there was question that, I think, Christina asked regarding pipeline capacity. You don’t stood around what the hurdle rate would be for a pipeline versus trucking, perhaps in terms of speaking to size of discovery, perhaps if we just deal into the off take well productivity, what level of production would be required from a new discovery or discover is for you to basically invest in additional pipeline capacity?"," 10,000 barrels a day.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Okay.," Below 10,000 barrels a day, we would drill 10,000 barrels a day, we expand trucking capacity more than that, we’d have to think about pipeline economic.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield," I mean, perhaps, you can remind me, how much that capacity does actually exists within the pipeline network downstream at Costayaco, first of fall, within your own time pipeline, but second within the network there after than Orito?"," The north-south segment to our self point has between 5 and 10,000 barrels a day, they are classic.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Yeah.,From Santana West to Orito they were zero.,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Yeah. That was always the checkpoint.," From Orito Peidemonte there is a big around 45,000.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Martin Eden," Yeah. Okay. If I may, a question of detail. On DD&A, I know that the units DD&A felt significantly from 1Q to 2Q and I know, was on a gross barrel basis from some 2,250 to 1,850 per barrel. Now, while the reserve base and you talk about this in the press release, while the reserve base would be different from year-on-year comparison, I would have thought that the first quarter, second quarter reserve base would be have been identical, so perhaps, can you speak to the decline in the units depreciation second quarter to first quarter, essentially what should be the – what would your guidance here will be?",June – first quarter we had to write-down on our Argentina assets.,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Martin Eden,Yeah.,… so $8.7 million that affected the rate in the first quarter.,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Martin Eden,Okay.,The second quarter rate would be what you anticipate going forward.,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield," Fair enough. And if I may, one last question, you spoke earlier to the delay to your drilling program in Columbia, and indeed I have no problem with delays to exploration with appraisal of success, but I do note the permitting raises its ugly ahead, yet again, and I see that reference in a number of the wells, if I just pick one, Rio Blanco just as an example. I mean that was being spoken about I know within your presentations mid last year, probably early last year. I just want to get a better feel as to what take so long with regard to the permitting. Because I was under the impression there was a fairly well understood and transparent process within the regulatory authority for such permitting?",The environmental permitting process is very – it's very well defined in Columbia…,,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Yeah.," … this month, it can become complicated or extended basically goes up and then a year along attention if that was own community to identify. And thus, they can have expensive delays and then it was also here in a coastal area, there’s additional permits required, forestry permits for cutting the trees for locations. So these are additional factors that can change permitting schedule or timing for different work.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield," Yeah. I mean, I guess, if I was to play devil’s advocate, my bold question to you would be could or should any of these various institutes have been anticipated given that unless I’m mistaken a good number of these prospects have been in your inventory and planned in your drilling plan for some time. And essentially anticipation of such things you may have been able to sort of albeit the delays that we’re now seeing."," Well, there’s two things that has which could have productivity because we’re now seeing requirements to consult within this communities outside their areas. So if you’re looking at operations near, average on community area being here, now requires concentration.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Okay.," And the other is of course, sea waters change and that is one of our blocks that was the case where we firstly portion what is where on the maps, what the maps there were and thought we’re not correct.",,,,,,
David Dudlyke,Dana Coffield,Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for all your answers to my question. Thank you very much.," Thanks, David.",,,,,,
Frederick Cozak,Dana Coffield," Good morning guys. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to explore though, something that may or may not being impact to you guys. Petrominerales put up their press release month or so ago that they were having an issue with the ANH on their – on the interpretation of the contract, exploitation areas versus the block for the high price royalty, given that you’ve got Costayaco, now discovery on Moqueta and are still doing exploration on the Chaza block have you had any conversation with the ANH on this topic and what is your view of what you have in terms of contract and the potential for dispute with ANH for high price royalty?"," No, I don’t see any dispute with ANH. Our contract is very clear. The high price royalty is on exploitation area, by exploitation area; those are almost at a cost like completely outside the exploitation areas, Costayaco, we don’t see that as an issue.",,,,,,
Frederick Cozak,Dana Coffield,Have you actually have the conversation with the ANH about that?," Personally, I haven’t. No, I know it really help write the contract our company manager.",,,,,,
Frederick Cozak,Dana Coffield,Okay. That was – do you have an update presentation that you’re going to post that shows Costayaco East or Pacayaco location on your Chaza Blocks?," I was afraid you’ll ask that. So I guess, I have to yes, we will, it’s not really yes but there will be.",,,,,,
George Toriola,Shane Leary," Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on the production profile, particularly, out of Costayaco. What I’m wondering here is what type of exploitation activity do you have of that support – essentially holding production flat here, maybe you can just provide some color into what you’ll be doing, assuming between the Caballos and the T-sands. That’s sort of thing."," Well, the field is relatively young. So it’s in its plateau phase and based on reservoir modeling, we are projecting sort of a two to three year plateau. The types of things, we will be doing more off is water flooding. Going forward, we are starting now to drill water injector wells and we are going to be injecting water – starting in September in C-5 and then later on into C-11 as part of our reservoir modeling. We need to inject water into the T-sand. We will be adding development wells over time. We think we’ve got enough wellbores into the structure at this point in time to maintain plateau. So going forward the production strategy is to increased water handling, inject water, drill development wells as needed and hold plateau as long as possible.",,,,,,
George Toriola,Dana Coffield," Okay. Thanks. And secondly on the – I’m just wondering on the Rio Magdalena Block, Popa-3 well, just wondering why that – why are you drilling that now as against everything else is just – is this licensing, why does it sort of come up at the top of your drilling priority right now?"," It’s a good prospect and we wanted to drill it before license expiry, which is this year. They wanted to drill before it was (inaudible).",,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Shane O’Leary," Good morning. Couple of questions around the new budget. Just looking at the increase, I think it implies that you’re going to be spending around almost $90 million per quarter from Q3 and Q4. I don’t think you’ve been spending anything close to that today. Obviously, you’ve been staffing up and getting ready for this for long time. I’m just wondering with the timelines, how realistic is that uptick in our activity and particular with regards to some of the new locations that you’ve added to the program. Are those all permitted locations approved and rigs secured?"," You’ll be willing to know that initial capital spending, not on staffing but it is on operation. There has been a significant delay in our operations particularly with Peru which is where significant slippage in budget has occurred. But the delay in permitting for the cyclic and drilling. Right now, often running, so we’re going to execute that program. We added well in Moqueta development wells and again in the rigs working in a production plate so that additional expenditure is going to happen, So I might – I guess the short answer to your question is yeah, there has been slippage in capital spending. Our capital spending has increased and it is – I'm trying to get it done this year.",,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Shane O’Leary,And a couple of details. There was a well at Florida West that seems to have disappeared from the schedule.,Yeah. This has been dropped; just the other momentary prospect has taken this place.,,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Dana Coffield," Okay. And can you say why Costayaco East has popped up as near-term drill ready prospect, something changed in your utilization of that area?"," What we’ve been doing is advancing our mapping or continued our mapping, not just that but a broadly worked prospects in our portfolio. And mapping reached a point where we’re comfortable drilling it. It is very perspective and we have a permit that we can drill a location front, so we can put it into the schedule and accommodate for the slippage to some of the other prospects. And just to comment, mainly to the east on the other side of wall (inaudible) both of the Costayaco field, so it’s a separate prospect, but it’s very close to Costayaco field.",,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Dana Coffield," Hi. Thanks. Just following up on Rafi’s earlier questions. On these, some of your earlier announced asset disposals – if I recollect correctly, the Rio Magdalena disposal went hand-in-hand with the Mecaya disposal. Just wondering that disposal was still going ahead, is that correct?",No. It’s not.,,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Dana Coffield,So you will be returning the interest in the Mecaya Block. And I guess related to that there were letters of intent for multiple blocks including the Garibay Block. I’m just wondering if we should consider those as cancelled.,Those are not yet sold. The Garibay and also the un-doubling on the blocks in the far north had good blocks. Those transactions are not yet closed.,,,,,,
Jamie Somerville,Dana Coffield," And sorry, just lastly on this – obviously you have taken an additional 4% in Rio Magdalena, which assumed that that was for no consideration?",Correct. Okay.,,,,,,
Martin Molyneaux,Dana Coffield," Gentlemen, I take it as 7 kilometer trying from Moqueta. You’re looking at taking kind of six to eight months to get this in place I think, the challenges here, the environmental approval and then you’ve got the river crossing to undertake also."," That’s correct. The environment premise has to get certain light. There is a river crossing as we said. And then there is also a land acquisition to three pieces of what to be done at the process you’ve already started. And of course, we haven’t decided the design, the diameter of the (inaudible).",,,,,,
Martin Molyneaux,Shane O’Leary," Gentlemen, we have now seeing specific (inaudible) chemical industries announcement, that (inaudible) is seeking a Columbian listing. Have you wrapped your mines around this and any thoughts on that in the future?"," We are considering it, but we have not made any decision. There’s strongly a lot of interest in Columbia for Columbian names, but we have not persuaded at this time.",,,,,,
Neal Dingmann,Shane O’Leary," Good morning, guys. Let say, first question, I was wondering on – you mentioned in the press release about likely drilling a significant well in Argentina, I was just wondering your thoughts about the pricing environment there. If you are becoming more encouraging, after this as well, will you continue to become more active in Argentina going forward?"," Yeah. We are actually very encouraged by gas prices in Argentina. You are also seeing some major companies come in just to pursue gas opportunities now. But when we look at the product, the potential productivity of this well and getting to see somewhere between $4 and $5 in MMbtu, this thing can be a real cash scale for Gran Tierra, potentially generating $30 million a year for a long period of time. So it’s definitely worth pursuing.",,,,,,
Neal Dingmann,Shane O’Leary," Got it. And then I was wondering, as far as in Brazil, you mentioned about opportunities there but I think in the press release, you didn’t mentioned, but potentially drilling wells, I was wondering sort of the near term any plans or is it more just on size, looking that sort of thing or is there some wells or there is some sort of site that you are starting to identify."," We are looking at half a dozen opportunities at any one-time in Brazil. We are continuing to evaluate those. Well, at this point in time, we do not have any acreage in Brazil. So we are evaluating the number of opportunities and hope to have a position here in Brazil, sooner than later preferably.",,,,,,
Neal Dingmann,Dana Coffield," Okay. And then it appears, after the results that you are seeing so far in the Moqueta-1 and 2 that – now, you are drilling six wells. I mean, again, how fluid, Dana, is that sort of CapEx so that – those plans based on sort of its results, if those wells cumbered, you will drill six regardless or could that change this year or even going to next year but depended on results."," We are going to proceed to drilling of all the wells that we’ve talked about. That uncertainty would be on timing, interpreting what experiences here, as we have others, because of the Moqueta success, we kept the rig there so that delayed through the drilling. We actually added three wells to the program. We’re constantly high grading in the portfolio. So well, we are constant, reflect those – additional wells been added and perhaps one or two been drop. So currently, (inaudible) drill, essentially, if we don’t program, we laid out, plus these additional three wells and it’s just going to take a little bit more time to do drilling. There are no wells that we had budgeted at beginning of the year.",,,,,,
Neal Dingmann,Martin Eden," So it sounds like lot of potential there. Last question maybe for, Martin, just – around that FX loss this quarter, I mean is there anything sort of going forward to add something where you can lock in that to maybe mitigate some of this FX or is there just anything to do around that. I guess one part is that you’re trying to model that."," We thought about hedging, but especially it’s an accounting loss actually. When you go into the expensive, taking how to hedge, which has real costs just to try and hedge an accounting loss. So it’s basically, whatever the exchanges rates do, it will impact our net income going forward and we probably will predict what this is going to be.",,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," Yes. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First of all, congrats on few things, Moqueto probably being the biggest one. Question on the Rio Mag Block, I’ve noticed that you’ve got back 40% operatorship and there are another sort of 4%, you got the proprietary drilling. You mentioning oil prospect, I always thought that it was more gassy, especially in the months of that formation. So just curious as to what the – though on the oil in the sphere and then may be more general, was that sort of the rationale in getting the Block back versus having opted to sell it sort of late last year."," That’s a prospect we’re drilling is not an old prospect, Popa-1 and Popa-2 as you know found out, this is actually such a prospect at a shallow level, unfortunately it was already named with Popa-3 well, because of shower that’s why I was expecting to find oil, of course, the gas, we’re also looking for oil. I can’t really comment on details that how I likely got the interest back rather than to say that we had got the interest back and the prospect for doing this one is that was mapped and defined by the Gran Tierra team.",,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," Perfect. That’s actually – okay. You can’t comment, but fair to say that you guys saying the block are definitely worth having, or else you probably wanted to take it back.",Yeah.,,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to, sort of, circle back a bit on the exploration program, Dana. The six remaining wells could be drilled now and earlier on, we had 23 million barrels risks for seven wells in Columbia. Of those six, we’ve got a few new ones and few ones that got pushback to 11 of the six that are left to drill. Are we still looking at $23 million on the risk – sorry, a risk – if we do include, if we consider Moqueta has not yet been drilled or theoretically, keep the number in there I guess as a risk number, are we still at 23 or is it higher or lower?"," Well, for the program it would be the same and so the wells have been deferred into first half or first quarter, perhaps next year plus these three new ones, the risk number will be higher. We’ve got three more prospects. Resource potential lease is consistent with the other, so we add approximately 9 million barrels of net risk resource potential to the program.",,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," And if we stripped off Moqueta from that total, what do we get?"," We are still trying to figure our outlook. Moqueta has a bit – take it out but the net risk resource potential, it’s probably around three or so.",,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," Thank you. So let’s follow up some of the production question that George was asking. Most specifically, can you tell us if you saw anything positive pressure wise, once you brought the wells that were shut in back on, Costayaco-1 being one example, the second sort of link to that question is, senior term what two to three years plateau production – if I can very simple if we take the two pee reserves booked at end of ’09 divide them by current production. I can’t get to two or three years. So are you seeing something that gives you confidence, you’re going to see some of the possible bumped up or are they’re going to produce some of the possible?"," Well, first of all, I don’t write it as a model. It’s not the same as GLJ. We make our decision on what – on our reservoir modeling. And we saw, I mean we see that there’s more outsider reserve then GLJ there but, of course all we’re allow to do is to report GLJ reserve. Well, if you’re using the GLJ reserve from last year, it’s not surprising you’re coming to that conclusion. It’s been on plateau year already.",,,,,,
Rafi Khouri,Dana Coffield," No, exactly and so I guess to sort of may be rephrase my question, do you think there’s anything data wise especially that you did have well shut in, so we’re going to see some nice, I am assuming we might have seen some less pressure built as well. If there were the case, do you have any data that you think as GLJ revises their reserve at the end of 2010 for Costayaco, they should be giving sort of an increase in 2p reserves obviously exploiting production that you will have this year?"," Well, I mean the Caballos reservoir has a very active water rise. So it’s been very low depletion of pressure in the Caballos. The T-Sand it does, it has some water dry by not as active and that has been the target of water injections. So we didn’t really see anything that surprised us in shutting in the wells. I mean, we don’t see much pressure depletion in the Caballos, for example. But I don’t – we’re not expecting, today I can’t say that will have reserve addition from GLJ at the end of the year, based on anything that’s going in the field.",,,,,,
