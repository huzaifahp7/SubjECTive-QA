Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson," First, Dennis on the military segment you said the system remains challenged there, can you give us an idea on how the broader military commissary system is trending on sales right now?"," Actually, as we turned the calendar quarter, [indiscernible] performance seems to have improved. Now, we don’t have numbers yet for January, but our numbers are showing growth through the first eight weeks of the year which is different than what we experienced all of last year. I suspect DeCA is probably showing some growth as well. It’s modest growth but it is growth. We’ve done a lot of hard work in this segment. We’ve got a great leadership team in place. We’ve won some new business over the past six months, and we expect that will show up in the revenue stream. As such, Dave indicated we’re forecasting positive sales in that segment this year.",,,,,,
Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson," I know you personally have been spending some time on this segment, give us an update on your longer term thoughts on maybe expanding beyond just the commissary business as you get into thinking about troop feeding or base exchanges? Is any of that moving forward or are you still kind of in the early stages of planning for that?"," We very much believe that the entire system would benefit from a more efficient distribution platform and frankly, we believe that we’re that solution. We are a worldwide solution to the commissaries. We also believe that the platform is perfectly suited to do far more business both in regard to troop feeding, and a lot of that goes overseas and we’re the preeminent supplier to Europe and Asia with our partner Coastal Pacific so we know that game plan very well. We think the exchange opportunity is a significant one and we continue to mine it in there as well. I think there’s plenty of upside to organically grow this business by getting into those additional segments.",,,,,,
Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson," Then on the backend of that business on the supply side and efficiencies there, especially as you combine your wholesaling management as well as the military sourcing, maybe you could talk about the opportunities on the backend?"," I think we have in the past year actually done a very nice job bringing the core SpartanNash merchandising and procurement team into a tighter working relationship with the MDV supply chain. We’ve already begun to see some benefits of that and part of that is just in the way we go to market as we talk to our customers in the space which, as you know, are the really the CPGs. I think we’re well on the way to using the full width and breadth of our offer to grow that military business.",,,,,,
Q –Shane Higgins,Dennis Eidson," Just looking at the retail EBITDA margins year-over-year, and I know they’re not exactly comparable, I see that they’re up about 20 basis points, was this primarily due to the merger synergies and the store closures?"," It was a little bit of both and it was also probably a little bit of how we’re working the segment numbers. When you look at how we’ve treated the profitability of retail in the past we had it pretty much as a standalone entity where we treated distribution as a full profit center. This year, and we’ve adjusted the history last year so it’s not much of a factor, we’ve kind of changed that now to where we put a lot of the profitability into the retail segment versus the distribution segment and so we’ve equaled that out. That shouldn’t change a lot year-over-year, but just so you have a better understanding how we’re doing it. I think the store closures certainly helped that EBITDA margin as well.",,,,,,
Q –Shane Higgins,David M. Staples, What about the margins just looking at the legacy Spartan stores? I know you guys talked a bit about some of the initiatives that you’ve been rolling out there and you hope to roll out west. How to margins really look on a year-over-year just within the legacy Spartan segment?," We’re really not breaking that out anymore. The business continues to morph together and become one, breaking out the segments isn’t something we’re really going to do going forward.",,,,,,
Q –Shane Higgins,David M. Staples," As we look out modeling the segment for next year, are you guys thinking about margins improving a bit? I know you’re closing some stores and obviously you continue to benefit from the synergies. How should we think about margins for the segment in ’15?", Maybe some slight improvement but overall the margins will be relatively consistent but a little bit upside across the company on margins.,,,,,,
Q –Shane Higgins,David M. Staples," Then switching over to cap ex, the $75 million to $80 million guidance, is that mostly for the remodels and rebannering that you’re doing? Could you just give us a little bit more color on that?"," If you look at how we do that, slightly more than half typically goes, probably in the $45 million or so range goes into the retail group. The rest is spread out between distribution, and systems, and corporate. Then when you look at the majority of that $45 million, certainly a very significant component of that would go into the remodeling efforts.",,,,,,
Q –Shane Higgins,David M. Staples," Then just one final one just to clarify, you guys are looking for year-over-year sales growth in the food distribution and military segments, is that on a 52 week comparable basis or does that include cycling the 53rd week?"," Well, certainly on the 52 week basis is how we’re looking at that for the most part?",,,,,,
Ajay Jain,Dennis Eidson," The weather headwinds that you mentioned had a lot of impact in December, I think you guys mentioned, but I just want to confirm do those weather comparisons improve since December or not necessarily?"," First of all, is should have said this before I took the first question. I want to thank all the analysts for bearing with us going through this first year and all these adjustments and merger related. You read the script and it’s hard to follow and I appreciate that and we’re looking forward here to getting to a clean 2015 and having these numbers be a little easier to digest. The winter weather we’re talking about really was about last year the state of Michigan had I think it was the number two all-time snow fall and we got plenty of snow storms and a lot of snow. West Michigan got 107 inches of snow, we normally get in the 70s range. When we started to cycle that in December, we started to see the comps fall off a little bit. We just couldn’t get that pantry loading replaced with this year’s weather. In fact, in December we had 31 inches less snow than we had the prior year December and through the middle of February, December, January, and February we’ve got 61 inches less snow than a year ago which almost is like the annual season snow fall. We were kind of like the opposite of Boston, they’re getting it this year, we got it last year. I hate talking about the weather as it relates to the sales, but when it’s that significant it was clearly a contributor. We are seeing it moderating a little bit as we move through January and now into late February and early March.",,,,,,
Ajay Jain,Dennis Eidson," Would you be able to confirm your quarter-to-date comps? I also wanted to confirm how long the price freeze that you mentioned, how long that’s been in effect for your wholesale business?"," I don’t think we’d be accustomed to giving comps but I think, as Dave pointed out in his remarks, that we feel these headwinds in the quarter and so you would expect to see that and we also guided to flat EPS versus a year ago for Q1 with regard to headwinds. The price freeze program is a program that we put in place several years ago and it continually gets refreshed. We typically do it on a seasonal basis so we’ll have a winter group, and then a spring group, and then a summer group, and the weeks will sometimes change, but think of it almost in an orderly basis we change up the items in the price freeze program. Although, some items have been in the price freeze program for the full three years. It’s a little bit of a blend and a mix and we think it’s helped us do a better job with price perception in our value score as we track that from consumer feedback.",,,,,,
Ajay Jain,Dennis Eidson," On the store closures that you talked about, did those stores fall in a particular region or is it more broad based? Also, can you comment on whether they’re more specific to the legacy Nash business or are they more in Michigan?"," We obviously aren’t going to get into the locations, but the store closures will be primarily domiciled in the western store base.",,,,,,
Ajay Jain,Dennis Eidson," If I could just ask one final question, I know you’ve had a lot of super center exposure over the years in Michigan, but in terms of the recent square footage growth with neighborhood markets, are you seeing any kind of incremental impact both from the standpoint of your wholesale customers and with your own retailing operations? It seems like there’s been a lot of growth in that format very recently and I think they’re also comping in the high single digits?", We’re seeing those numbers being reported. We don’t have any neighborhood markets in the Michigan marketplace. We have experienced the neighborhood market activity in the Nebraska marketplace and they actually recently expanded with neighborhood markets in the past couple of years. I think the total number of neighborhood markets I think in the Omaha market is up to seven or eight right now and they’re all relatively new.,,,,,,
Mike Otway,Dennis Eidson," You guys are now I guess kind of 15 plus months past the close of the deal with Nash and as you guys think about the last year or so what the team has learned, some of the positives, the prizes, some of the hurtles, are you more excited about certain opportunities now than you were maybe a year ago, or on the flipside are there things that are taking a bit longer to play out than maybe you had originally anticipated? Any color there would be helpful."," I think we are really on plan with regard to 15 months in, I’ll start out by saying that. You may recall, a year ago at this call we laid out some guide posts for the business for this year. I said we expected sales between $7.9 billion and $8.0 billion and you see we delivered on that number. We said we were expecting synergies of $20 million. I’ve told you consistently that we’ve beaten the synergy number. We said we expected EBITDA between $230 million and $239 million, the number here today is $234 million plus in EBITDA, right there in the middle of that range. We actually guided EPS of $1.65 to $1.75 and yet we’re reporting $1.85. You think about beating that number and being in the range, I think you’re going to understand why we feel pretty good about being able to call where we were going to be able to come out despite the fact that’s not an easy modeling exercise to do. Then you take the $1.85, on a 52 week basis it’s $1.80 as we pointed out and you look at the guidance next year and we’re saying we’re going to go 5% to 10% more than that already accelerated number from the original expectation, I think you might glean from that we’re feeling pretty optimistic about where things are today and where we can go. It really is only 15 months in and there is a full three years’ worth of work in the integration. There’s a lot left to do, but I think we have fundamentally transformed the company and I think we’ve built the foundation as truly a platform for growth and as I look at the space I don’t feel any differently than I did a year ago with regard to their will continue to be opportunities to consolidate the space as scale and size become more and more important. That maybe is a long winded answer, but I’m feeling good about the outlook.",,,,,,
Mike Otway,Dennis Eidson," Then maybe kind of switch gears in terms of the Nash Finch stores and the focus on getting those comps and that business the desired level. Are they under penetrated in terms of private label, organics, is there some low hanging fruit that as you guys roll some of these initiatives through that there are some things that you can kind of see relatively quickly? By quickly, maybe in the next year or so? Then, how are you thinking about pricing in those stores?"," I think the story on the Nash legacy retail is it’s a combination of things. I might start with under [indiscernible], so in Spartan I’ve been here 13 years and when I came the store base was in need of a lot of investment and we got through that and turned our fleet of stores into a meaningful chain. I think in the case of Nash Finch there just has not been that amount of capital redeployed into the stores over the course of the past decade and so we need to catch up. Some of the stores are just not going to fit and we outlined having store closings in fiscal ’15. Some of the merchandising I would say probably was not as robust as we would have seen in the historical Spartan legacy but that isn’t to say that everything is broke. I think they’ve got a great private brand program in place and that private brand business continues to perform well. It over indexes the national average. It’s a little bit softer than the Spartan numbers. We think there’s opportunities there with regard to the fresh parameter where Spartan has put a lot of emphasis on produce and meat private brand items. We think we can get some low hanging fruit there as we move forward. Many of the stores haven’t been remerchandised in a while. We think we’ll get benefits from reflows and remerchandising. The Dickinson and Fargo markets that we talked about earlier were getting very nice top line sales increases as we’ve remodeled and rebranded those stores. I don’t think there are a ton of quick hits. There are some that we’ll get but it’s really more blocking and tackling, and I think we have the right team to do it and we’re anxious to make some real progress this year.",,,,,,
Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson, Just another question on that difficult year ago comparison from the snow storms last year. Do you think the Michigan retail comp could be positive in the first quarter?," We really haven’t guided that. We indicated that Michigan was .9% for the year, that was the comps. We have also said that our comps are going to be slightly negative to slightly positive for the full year for the total retail enterprise. I would tell you that our expectation is that Michigan over performs that .9% comps in fiscal ’15 and we think we can get better performance in the Michigan retail than last year’s .9%, yet we’re cautious about guiding anything different than slightly negative to slightly positive for the entire retail base.",,,,,,
Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson," Also on the acquisition front, you talked about the merger being a new platform for acquisition driven growth. I think when you originally announced the deal you said maybe 18 months after the acquisition you could start thinking about doing acquisitions. We’re kind of getting close to that milestone. Where do you see the opportunities? Is it more on wholesale or retail? Then maybe if Dave could comment on where you’d be comfortable moving the financial leverage if a new deal came up because right now you’re at 2.4 times debt-to-EBITDA, where could that move up to if you saw something sizeable?"," I’ll take the last part first. We’re at 2.4 times, I think we started the year at 2.9 times, so we’ve gotten that leverage down. We’ve discussed in here we’ll try to get this down to two times leverage which we feel very comfortable at. If you watch Spartan and really under Dave’s leadership over the years, we’ve levered up and we’ve been very diligent about paying down that debt. I think the answer is really it depends. It depends on the kind of transaction that we’re looking at. Could we get into the high threes and feel somewhat comfortable? I think yes we could for the right opportunity, for the right strategic opportunity to grow the business. I don’t think that kind of leverage would concern us whatsoever. Dave you can chime in if you’re feeling any differently about that. On the opportunities, I think they continue to exist and we are getting closer to the 18 months and we’re always opportunistically looking for the right acquisitions and we think that with 18 months or so behind us we will be better equipped to do it. But, we’re not going to do an acquisition for the sake of doing one. We’re going to find the right ones and they’re going to be out there and we’re going to take advantage of them as they come up.",,,,,,
Mark Wiltamuth,Dennis Eidson, At this point do you think they’re more smaller regional platform enhancing or are you thinking some more bigger transactions?, I think it could be either.,,,,,,
