Drew Crum,Maureen O'Connell," Good morning everyone. Maureen, I had a question on the free cash flow. If you look at where you were in fiscal '15 and what you're guiding to the fiscal '16, you've got a number of puts and takes there, kind of one-time items. What is the more normalized free cash flow level that we should expect for the business going forward, now that Ed Tech is not part of the mix? And then on a related note, where should we expect cash -- your ending cash balance to be at the end of fiscal '16? Thanks."," Okay. So Drew, as far as our ongoing cash flow, the transaction-related fees are 20 million, that's a one-time item, and the 10 million of Ed Tech cash flow contribution, well, that will be out of our numbers. So I think you can expect going forward that our cash flow would be very similar to our historical levels, but 10 million less for Ed Tech.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Maureen O'Connell, Okay. And the CapEx that you're guiding to this year is elevated [ph] obviously. What is a more normalized run rate for CapEx going forward?," Also, I should say that our definition of free cash flow in 2016 does not include the $186 million tax payment related to Ed Tech sales. So that is not included, which would write down our cash balance at year end. As far as the normal CapEx, I think the range that we are guiding to today is more normal. If you look at our historical levels that would be the range we are normally in. The last two years we stopped CapEx, particularly in the technology area as we assessed what our corporate level needs were. And most of what we spent last year in technology was expense, as opposed to capitalized, because we were in the design phase. Now we will start capitalizing as we go live with certain systems.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Maureen O'Connell," Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just moving over to the international business, do you have an expectation for growth ex-foreign currency in terms of sales? And you guys did some investment spending in fiscal '15, does that continue in '16, and how much of a drag is that on profitability?"," So we do expect to grow ex-currency about 4% next year. And this year we grew ex-currency about $7.5 million on that $400 million base. So in real terms, the market currencies are -- the local markets are growing. We're seeing strong growth in Asia, and continue to see double-digit growth. And then single growth in Australia, and the U.K. Canada had some headwinds this year, so they didn't see the same level of growth.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Maureen O'Connell, Okay. Just one more question. It's unclear to me what your sales expectations are for trade. It looks like you've got a pretty good pipeline of content coming. Could you frame up what you're assuming in terms of the growth for the business?," Well, we had a great success this year with our Minecraft books and series. And so we have to replace that next year. And so even though we have a very strong outlook in pipeline of new products coming out in 2016, we need to replace the revenues similar to what we did this year with Minecraft replacing some of the Hunger Game revenues.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Dick Robinson, Okay. Thank you.," Thanks, Drew.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Maureen O'Connell," Great, thank you and good morning. I've got a host of odds and ends, if you don't mind. Maureen, you touched on some normalized numbers earlier, what would be the normalized overhead burden that we are looking at going forward?"," I think right now, the way that we are driving our technology spend we leave it all in overhead, and we're not allocating it out to our divisions. So in absolute terms, overhead only went up for technology by 3 million. So overhead -- I'm sorry; the whole company's technology spend only went up by 3 million. Within our overhead, it looks like a $27 million increase. It is offset primarily in the children's books, with a decrease in spend. So next year you will see flat overhead year-over-year, but remember that's about $25 million, $27 million that sits in overhead that used to sit in the divisions.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Maureen O'Connell," Okay. And the restricted cash that's sitting on the balance sheet, when those restrictions get listed, or is it somehow tied to these payments that you'll be reimbursed for by the Houghton?"," So the way that the restricted cash works is most of it is tied to our service agreements and meeting certain standards of service. And the money begins to be released in August. It's about $2.4 million will be released in August, and our expectation is that escrow will be released during the year. Right now we are meeting all service level requirements, and we feel we are in a good place with our service agreement.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Dick Robinson," Okay. One on the business and then capital allocation, you touched base on Goosebumps and the movie that's coming out, anything special, I'm sure you're doing some specials. I hope you can provide a little color as to how you prep for that, and what would be the anticipation in terms of revenues or the benefits thereof from the movie?"," I think that Ellie Berger will answer that question, Barry. Thank you.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Ellie Berger, So that's part of what you are banking on to replace Minecraft I take it?," Yes. That's some of the excitement we have coming into the fall, yes.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Dick Robinson," Okay. Maybe more for Dick now; on the capital allocation, you're talking $315 million net cash after taxes, the restricted cash comes back closing at $350. And then you've got the building. And I don't know, Dick, $50 million repurchase of authorization feels a little skinny."," Well, I think the board wanted to respond to the fact that we do have increased cash and we do want to return cash to shareholders. However, we're going to do in this in a measured fashion. And so we chose to do opportunistic stock buybacks as opposed to plan. But we'll keep looking at this, Barry, and knowing that our shareholders are certainly interested in the whole question.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Dick Robinson," Okay. I mean the cash is certainly a drag at -- with practically zero interest rates, it doesn't help performance. Not that we're asking to rush out the money, shouldn't burn a hole in your pocket. Obviously it's not, but it is a drag. And on the building, anything further in terms of color; you've certainly mentioned often enough that the SoHo district is on fire. What are some of the issues that are impeding or swelling the process? I don't want to say impedingâ€¦"," Well, having just completed the Ed Tech transaction, Barry, with those cash which you say is drag, we're not necessarily in a hurry to bring anymore drag into our picture. But as we discussed in our last conference call, we've not entered into any agreement on real estate here in SoHo, but the commercial real estate market as you suggest remained strong for both retail and office space, and interest remains high in our real estate for sure. The purchase of our headquarters location last year was very timely and well executed we think, and we believe our real estate is going to help the company and our shareholders substantially over the long-term, but we're measuring carefully what we want to do with it, and we'll obviously continue to keep you informed when and if we have a plan.",,,,,,
Barry Lucas,Dick Robinson," Great. Thanks very much, Dick."," Thank you, Barry. Good to talk with you.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Dick Robinson," Okay, thanks. Just to follow-up to Barry's question on capital allocation; Dick, can you talk about the board's position on buybacks versus dividends, and philosophically how you approach that? I can appreciate that the $50 million addition to the share buyback, but I know in the past you guys have been reluctant to buyback more stock and -- concerns around reducing your liquidity further given the large buybacks you've done in the past. So can you just address philosophically how the board looks at dividends versus buybacks going forward?"," Sure. Well, I should remind you that since 2006 we have returned like $560 million to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends. So we haven't been bashful about this over time. The board really didn't stop to consider our dividend policy at this point, Barry, as for this board meeting. I think we're looking to talk about this in our September meeting to figure out for our next year of operation what our dividend policy should be short and longer term. So the lack of an increase in the dividend is not a statement on our long-term attitude toward dividends. At the same time, we are -- sorry, Drew, this is in response to your question, not to Barry. In response to the buybacks, I think again, we will come back to you with a program on the stock buybacks that will be clearer over time.",,,,,,
Drew Crum,Dick Robinson," Okay. Thanks, guys.", Thank you.,,,,,,
