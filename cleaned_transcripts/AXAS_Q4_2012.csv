Noel A. Parks,Robert L. G. Watson," Just a couple of things. The last thing you mentioned was the Bakken sale, and you are not going to go through the transaction unless you're happy with the price. How long a process do you envision collecting bids and so forth before you think you'll decide one way or the other?"," The data room is scheduled to be opened about 4 weeks, 5 weeks. Bids are expected toward the end of April, maybe early May. I don't know that we've -- I'm sure we've set that date. I don't recall exactly what date it is. And then a close, late May, early June.",,,,,,
Noel A. Parks,Robert L. G. Watson," Okay. Great. And in the Eagle Ford, we've heard some other folks in the industry talking recently about continuing to have success staying in zone as they drill the laterals, and also recently heard something about another McMullen County operator saying that they actually were narrowing their target to a pretty defined interval that they were going after there. Can you give any insight on targeting on laterals, especially in McMullen there?"," Well, as you know, Noel, we do spend a lot of time staying in zone. We think that's of utmost importance for a successful completion. So yes, we do have a narrow target in the Eagle Ford that we are very comfortable that we're capable of staying in. Our geologists and -- are geo steering these wells 24/7. They've done an excellent job of staying in zone, and that could be one of the contributing factors to the very substantial success we've had on our wells so far to date.",,,,,,
Noel A. Parks,Robert L. G. Watson," Great. And can you sort of define maybe or break out the time periods where if we look in a well today and we compare it to a well, I don't know, how many months or a year ago, to sort of get a sense of before and after effect of the targeting?"," We have stayed in -- attempted to stay in target from Day 1. We just recognize that's very important in drilling these laterals. So I wouldn't say that any of -- none of our wells have been out of target for a substantial area yet. And I think on our website now, we do have our Eagle Ford type curve and the actual day-to-day production of all our wells. And you can see that all of them are performing well above the type curve that we've been given reserves for, and I would say that that's a pretty good proxy to the benefits of staying in zone.",,,,,,
Noel A. Parks,Robert L. G. Watson,Got you. And just one last one for me. Realized pricing was a little bit weaker than I had expected for the quarter. Was there anything going on there? I think it might have even been more pronounced on the gas side.," Probably was. Actually, I thought we were a little bit higher than consensus. And that would probably have been the impact from the Brent-like pricing that we're getting in the Eagle Ford, which is currently about $12 or $13 above WTI. And certainly, as we add Eagle Ford wells going forward and that Brent-like pricing remains, our differential should squeeze considerably. So I guess our expectations, we did better than we thought. I'm not familiar with yours exactly. So it's hard to address why we busted what you thought.",,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson," I know it's probably minutia, but just to get a number, the production on the May clearinghouse package, do you guys have a number on that?"," Yes. It's been the -- it's in our offset data, I think. It was about...",,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson," 2.9 million, thanks.",That was the dollars. What was the production associated with it?,,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson,I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm talking about the one that you mentioned doing at the next clearinghouse auction.," That's a smaller amount of gas volumes. It's all gas, though. There's no oil in the May auction.",,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson," Okay, perfect. And then, am I eyeballing the type curve right to say that the Raven 2H is going to be about 500 over its first month and then the 3H will be north of that when you say that it's meeting or exceeding?",I don't have that right in front of me. I would say that the Raven 2H is -- do you remember? Right on the curve orâ€¦,,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson," Okay, perfect. And then one last one, and I know this is kind of old news because you guys had already released that 6.1 number, but obviously with the well result, it becomes a little bit more important. Can you give us a reminder where that -- those savings were coming from to get down to the 6.1?"," Well, pumping costs are down substantially, and our drilling efficiency is up substantially. We're using considerably less days to get these wells drilled. Our bit selection is excellent. We're getting most of the well drilled with one bit. So when you can do that and avoid extra drilling time, you can really save a lot of bucks.",,,,,,
Welles W. Fitzpatrick,Robert L. G. Watson," Perfect. So now that's coming from design, then?"," We're always tweaking our design, but I think our design is dictated by what we've tried from a mechanical standpoint in previous wells. And what's working, we're implementing in newer wells, and that's speeding us up that much more.",,,,,,
J. Curtis  Brewer,Robert L. G. Watson," I just had a couple of questions. One is, I was reading an article recently about -- I think it might have been Devon, but I don't recall exactly who it was, one of the larger producers, that they have gone through experimentation to a process of drilling the laterals from drilling long 3,000-, 4,000-foot laterals to drilling much shorter laterals kind of on a radial basis around the core borehole. And in some cases, have been able to get flows of upwards of 6,000 barrels a day. For how long, I don't know, but is that technology something that we're looking at?"," Well, we're following it, Curt. I don't think it's applicable in the shales that we're working in. I'm not aware of it anywhere in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken. I think they're experimenting with that in some of the West Texas shales. So certainly, it's something -- we're always looking at what the industry's doing. It's not always easy to get that information. Some of the bigger companies keep it pretty confidential. But I think we're on top of what's going on in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, and that's what counts for us.",,,,,,
J. Curtis  Brewer,Robert L. G. Watson," Yes, it sounds like it when I see the flows that you're getting, well above your anticipated curve. The only other question I had has to do with, again, the result of some study of -- seeing quite a bit being written now about the Permian, that there are now 400 rigs drilling there and a lot of excitement having to do with the Cline Shale indicating that perhaps there's another 35 million barrels of oil down in there on top of the 35 that have been taken out of the play since 1917 or whatever. And I know we have activities in the Permian. Are we in an area that would include the Cline Shale and is what I'm reading viable or is it a little bit of hype?"," I think it's certainly of interest. It's still early stage. And specifically for Abraxas, 2 of our rather large held-by-production acreage blocks have now been offset by Devon, Cline Shale wells. One of them is on production. We're getting daily production from that well. It appears to be very commercial. It's within less than one mile of our Millican Reef held-by-production acreage. Our Spires Ranch has been offset by a direct offset, 500 feet off our lease line by a Devon, Cline Shale well. And at our last report, they were installing artificial lift equipment on that well and building a tank battery. It's not quite on production yet, but we're certainly watching them very, very closely.",,,,,,
