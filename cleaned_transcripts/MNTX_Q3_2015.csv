Chris Sansone,David Langevin," Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my call. So, exiting 2015, what percentage of your sales do you think will be ultimately energy related?"," I would have to say if you exclude utility in that, and certainly we're going to have sales in 2015 on the utility side. It's going to be a very low percentage for 2015."
Chris Sansone,David Langevin," Right. So, I tried to put together the numbers for what it looks like in 2014 and I came up with $130 million of energy related revenue on of course $480 million of total revenue."," If you have pro forma with all the businesses, you're right."
Chris Sansone,David Langevin," Yes, right so that gave you energy of 27% so exiting 2016 where do you think that number is?"," You certainly going to have some business, I mean I was thinking about it as you were summarizing that Chris and I mean you’re going to have some business because there is maintenance business going on so it's not going to be zero but it's not going to be 27% obviously it's going to be much closer to a 10% range I would think on a estimate. We are preparing 2016 but as now will enter that in much for us over the next couple of weeks, all the operations have been working on per weeks but we’ll start to get more actively enrolled. So I have a better REIT for that at the next call but I would say it's somewhere between zero and 10% I would guess, I don’t know Andrew if you have any thought on that but."
Dale Hefner,David Langevin," Hello guys. Well, I have been waiting here I have been crunching a couple numbers here. I guess my question is on SG&A. I see that like through the first nine months there was - say 250 point increase in gross margin, it looks like the SG&A got worse by about the same amount.",That’s right.
Dale Hefner,David Langevin," So I just wondering if there is, if you are looking at any potential improvements on SG&A I realize it you probably inherited SG&A structures with PM and ASP there were higher than what you historically had. But I was wondering if there was going to be any opportunity if you’re looking at improving that?"," Thanks Dale, thanks for your question. I would say but we have historically been in the 10% to 11% range but we ran very – ran rather simply when we were basically a North American oriented company. And now that we have expanded, we have more international obviously we’ve talked about the branches that we now own, those all add. So now we’re in the 13% to 14% range, it is probably more normal and we really miss clearly we should be running $125 million a quarter instead of $100 million a quarter. And if you do that math and obviously we’re down to the back to 10% to 11% range and you can do that, you can go from $100 million to $125 million without adding G&A. The other issue that we've had this time around is - it was much easier in 2009, it was very difficult because of the economic events. But from an operating standpoint, all reflects like crazy just everything went down. Well now of course you can possibly very often engineer, we need all the engineers we can if you laid off an engineer today, he has got a job tomorrow, he or she has a job tomorrow. So you have to be – you have to be very prudent and careful with - because you want to make sure the franchise is protected and the growth is when the markets it is very – we have very isolated situation that we are experiencing right now. So I would say in the short run, you should see some improvement but it will be more on the sales line rather than on the G&A line because we should be able to add sales and G&A much G&A increase."
Dale Hefner,David Langevin," Right. So you will grow your way into it eventually, right?"," That’s what we are going to do I think from now, yes."
Dale Hefner,David Langevin," Okay. And just one more and then I will get off. My second question involves on the capacity of that Texas plant. Obviously right now you are not manufacturing too many cranes there, so you could pick up through the next year - pick up some of that PM crane manufacturing there, but what happens when the straight mast market improves and then there is a lot more demand, is there going to be enough capacity there to do both?"," Yes it’s a very good size facility and we really flex it tremendously and we’ve been on the crane business as high as over $140 million in sales there and we’ve been as low as $20 million. So it’s quite a range and when we’re doing $140 million, we are running one shift. So we’ve never added significantly a significant second shift there. So now obviously we’re running at reduced work weeks at that facility. So we’re very anxious to get more production into that facility. And again I can't wait to have a high class problem like that again."
James Goodfellow,David Langevin," Hi guys. Good afternoon, just jumping on for Kristine here. Thanks for taking the question. We'd love to hear any updates, I know you kind of touched on this in your closing remarks, any updates on your intentions or activity in terms of streamlining the portfolio and I don’t know how you are looking at divestitures of non-core businesses going forward, any activity there, anything anecdotal would be very helpful."," Sure James. Well you know the process is not a quick process, it want to take some time and I would say that we are very far along on one of the companies and products that we have determined is something that we may entertain other opportunities and offers for. And I would say after that if we finish – hopefully we can finish something between now and the end of the year but that is not guaranteed and then I would expect us to take another stab at it again next year. But again it’s a certainly very important part of our strategy we built up. This company with a number of different products and companies and now that we’re at certain size will concentrate on our highest margin products at our highest margin companies and peel off the few of the lower ones which will do better in other circumstances, get more attention, get more resources. And we‘re also doing the same thing with our working capital because obviously as you look on our balance sheet, we have - and as Andrew summarized we have cash receivables and inventory in excess of $200 million and we need to turn all those quicker and faster and more importantly in that group we have $25 million of finished goods, so that is something that historically we never had anything at that level because we generally built order. But with the braches and the operations we have now, we do have more inventory and we do want to flush out inventory through the system and probably try to do as much as we can in the near term."
James Goodfellow,David Langevin," Okay. Thanks, that's helpful. Moving onto the oil field overhang if you will, some of your competitors have spoken this and you touched on in your prepared remarks, we would love to hear anything anecdotal or anything that you’re seeing in interaction with dealers or directly with customers in terms of where you see the process of clearing the used channel standing today?"," It’s still there; it is not as prevalent as it was last quarter. It’s less, there is more – there is more activity on the core side but I don’t expect it to end between now and the end of the year but we certainly hope that we have – if we have continuation only in the first half of the year and not the second half but again that’s very hard to determine. We just look at what we’ve sold in the marketplace, what we all have sold in the marketplace in the last two years 2013 and 2014. How much we are selling this year but we know the market is much larger because of the construction side. So you know if you just run some averages you have to have absorbed much of that overhang during this year. But I'd still think we will have some carryover into next year."
James Goodfellow,David Langevin," Okay. And then in terms of knuckle boom opportunity, can you speak to any specific end market reads on the European side of things, and any specific opportunities you've seen there?"," Well, the European market has performed much better this year, it continues to form well. They never had the rebound that we had because obviously they don't -- generally speaking, have the energy markets that we have. So, we didn't have the construction rebound after 2009, we had only energy rebound. Now we're seeing the construction market rebound, which is good because it's absorbing the downturn in the energy. But there over there, they're now are experiencing the construction rebound also because companies that have survived and have grown or are now starting to grow, have very old equipment. So, you have just the replacement cycle that you would normally would have every four or five years are now finally starting to kick in Europe. So, we're very optimistic that Europe this year has seen some growth and will continue to seem some growth as Andrew referred to in his prepared remarks."
James Goodfellow,David Langevin,Is there any specific among the geographies within Europe that you're seeing.," Well, U.K. is the strongest but believe it or not even places like Spain which were dead -- again the people have survived the awarding new equivalent. So, we generally see expense in our new orders coming in for -- we have branches in Spain, Germany, U.K., France, obviously the modern states are performing better. And so we have lot of exposure now to Europe and it's not so bad to housing exposure right now."
Les Sulewski,David Langevin," Just two -- hi, how are you? So, just to kind of work on the questions early about the markets raising productively, and you mentioned in the past and you were probably like nine months away and on the inventory kind of weaning out, I mean are we closer to maybe the three to six months away, can you comment a little bit more on that or what the inventory are in the marketplace?"," Sure. If you look at, we try to do those analytically. So, because it's a very hard, it's a very large market, it's hard to try to capture. But if you look at sales through the markets or units through the markets in 13 and 14, was roughly 3,000 units. And we assumed, at that time we were assuming and making statements that 50% of that was going to energy. So, it's 1,500 units. So, those 13 and 14 units were lot of times purchased in anticipation of additional growth beyond what they needed right now because I wanted to make sure they got their equipment because as we know, there was a tremendous lag -- I mean we were taking orders in 2012 and producing and shipping in 2013. So, there was a lag of when they were ordering versus when they were receiving their shipment. And so if you assume that this year you have another 1,500 to 1,800 unit market because of the increase in construction, so the increase in that market would normalize the straight mast boom market this year to be in the same range it has been over the last two years. We're really experiencing something closer to 2009 level, which is 600 units. So, you have somewhere around 900 to 1,200 units coming into the market from the energy space absorbing, absorbed or absorbing the growth in the construction market. So, that would tell you that you still have some more room to grow with that. If that analysis is right, then one could question whether that's right or wrong but that's we're trying to put some mathematical analysis around something that's very hard to do. And so that would made us to believe we have somewhere around six months you have to go, but again we'll see."
Les Sulewski,David Langevin," Yeah, thank you for clearing that up. That's helpful. Regarding the ASV side, you did $27 million in the third quarter and this is kind of a slow run rate, we would expect for the fourth."," Andrew might speak to that because you're closer. My overall assumption is slightly better but I -- you know production and what's happening there closer than me. Yeah, you're right in that statement. I've -- we're targeting slightly higher performance than the third quarter. Hopefully we'll some of the year end activity that often comes into the market. Also we get a little bit of pick up we'd rather relate it to sales and it's now clearing that type of activity. So, you're right, slightly above the quarter three numbers."
Les Sulewski,David Langevin," Overall, I guess on the gross margin side, is this the sustainable rates looking at next year?"," Well, we've been at those range now for little bit and certainly in earlier downturns especially ones that were as dramatic as what we've experienced at Manitex, we saw quite a bit of deterioration in the gross margins. But we seem to be able to with our diversification and with our cost reduction programs which have been very nicely implemented around our company, we seemed to be able to withstand higher margins. But then on the other hand of course as we've also commented, we have higher fixed costs, somewhat a couple of points here fixed costs is what we've experienced in the past. So, we need to have more sales like we've had in the past. So, we're hoping that 2016 will return back to some growth levels throughout our Company and not just in the PM and ASV areas."
Les Sulewski,David Langevin," Okay. I guess the last one on the PM side too, any kind of measurable savings that you expect from moving the manufacturing to Texas."," Well, we've always done very, very well out of that facility. And so what we expect is the efficiency, the absorption, and the renewable cost is not such a huge component for us in our cost of goods sold, principally, over head, indirect, and material. So, I would expect that plant to perform well as they have in the past. So, I would expect that any business we bring in the North America, sell in North America, make in North America, is going to be very profitable business."
Matt Koranda,David Langevin," Hi guys. Good afternoon. Just wanted to spin back to the repurposing of the straight mast boom truck fleet into construction from oil and gas, and just was wondering if you could comment on the pricing environment, I mean obviously that's put some pressure I would assume on pricing but maybe you could talk about the environment and what you're seeing there, and also maybe the dynamics, the competitive dynamics there as well, the implications for that just given that you guys are generally lower priced than some competitors, is it impacting some of your competitors more drastically seeing the lower price environment relative to you guys?"," Thanks, Matt. I will say generally the competitors, we have great competitors as we've said on many occasions. Everybody wants to make money, but it's a very, very difficult environment right now because you have some energy providers who just want to clear out inventory, just want to turn it into cash, and if you were a dealer and you had a job or you had a customer who wanted to buy a 40 ton crane and you could buy a 40 ton crane from the used market for half with very hours on it for half of what you can buy a new crane from us. It's no wonder we sell any cranes right now in the straight mast area because it's just very competitive and it's very competitive for everybody in our business. So you have to find pockets and we have some of those in utilities and other areas where they're not going into the used market, they're only buying new equipment's, and of course there are always pockets like that in the United States. But it is very competitive and it really drives our margins down to very, very low levels, which is why we're reporting what we're reporting. But that won't continue forever, that's going to turn around of course."
Matt Koranda,Andrew Rooke," Got it, very helpful. I was wondering maybe if you could just comment for 2016 and I think we've seen a lot of commentary on the call in ASV and PM and straight mast, but are the pockets of strength relative to the other businesses for 2016?"," Thanks so much. I'm glad you brought it up, because we need to speak about some of those things. Obviously, Lifting, we mentioned in my remarks that Lifting is now starting to produce some of the contracts that they signed quite some time ago because as you know there's a lag from the time that you sign a contract to the specs are signed off by all the department heads an the product goes into production. That's started in a limited way in the third quarter, that'll expand in the fourth and then it'll carry over into next year. As I mentioned, Sabre, has done an excellent job of changing the product profile from an energy based profile to a non-energy based profile, that will continue to grow into 2016. We mentioned that Load King has done a very commendable turnaround and is now on solid footing for next year. CVS has always done, although quite a while, has been a very consistent performer certainly in the -- you don't see the port business right now, when you look at containers any place in the world, it's not a growing business right now. But CVS has done a good job of taking market share and expanding it's business regardless of what's happened in the market. So we would expect that to continue."
Matt Koranda,David Langevin," Just on the quarter on gross margins, I mean year-over-year improvement was really nice, it looks like about 240 basis points of improvement, could you just talk about how much of that improvement was due to mix versus the cost reduction efforts that you guys have put in place?"," The biggest positive to that addition or to that growth was PM. The mix around the rest of the companies were not generally favorable that I can recall, Andrew, I don't know if you have any more clarity on that but I just, I would say the main provider was cost reductions and PM growth or PM addition, but certainly not Manitex because it didn't have it, Lifting had a little bit better."
Mike Sulewski,David Langevin," Couple of questions here, can we - ma be I have to go back and do my math again but when you guys said for PM you are looking about $100 million this year of revenue, looking back it was in the first two quarters is that kind of just a pretty solid fourth quarter here."," We did 23 in the last couple of quarters. Obviously we bought it in January of this year, had a short period in the first quarter. So that was in the low 20s and we should be - we believe with production and it's always difficult to try to pick production in the fourth quarter because of holidays and those are obviously especially and severe in Europe but we believe we will click over above the $25 million in the fourth quarter."
Mike Sulewski,David Langevin,So the hundred include the positive – but it was not part of your –," Yes, part of when we were – when they weren't part of us. We are trying to frame obviously Mike where we are internationally right now with that business and again we have business in the U.S. it's up essentially this year on North America but principally in the U.S. But again our ideas are we are trying to show that we want to expand that in the U.S. and continue to expansion in Europe and around the world as Andrew mentioned on the opening of the conditional branch."
Mike Sulewski,David Langevin," Got it. And then back on your core mast crane business, I guess maybe you can give us sort of overview of - I guess first it sounds like your language or tone was little bit likely you were bottoming here in that particular business may not got out any time soon but perhaps we reached a level where we can just kind of wait for things that on come back. I guess that's question would you agree with that. And then I guess part two of question is, I mean should we sit here and wait for the rig counts to improve before we see any increase in the core mast crane business."," Thanks Mike for the questions, I appreciate. I don’t think we were so concentrated on the rig counts because all that was again was just trying to demonstrate the decrease that we’ve had. We all know in – you and I and the other analyst have tried to figure out how can we analytically take where we are in the movement of energy equipment into the construction markets because clearly as we all know the construction market in North America is performing much better and so we know that and we see it every day and the auctions and then the used inventory market that start to used cranes that were produced in the - and are picked cranes produce in 2013 and 2014. Specially starting in the second quarter we are pouring into the market, absorbing the growth that you have on the construction side and those are first construction growth we’ve seen since 2009. And so if we try to analyze that and do any kind of measurement, it seems to be that while the order, the core activity and the activity that we have with customers is improving, we’re still not varied and that is such a big impact as you know in 2013 our crane business which was that time was $200 million - our total Manitex business was $200 million but crane business was a substantial portion of that. We earned over $0.80 a share. So we want to look at now and say, we’ve got PM business that’s growing, ASP business that's growing and when the Manitex business runs through with the energy overhang we should be in very good shape."
Mike Sulewski,David Langevin,Okay.," I don't know if that helped you, but it's not really rig count, it really can be a rig count because I just don't expect - we are not expecting rig count to significantly improve for sometimes. So it's really the construction market which is where we were always based prior to the energy changes in the North American market."
Mike Sulewski,David Langevin," Can I ask you this way perhaps, so you think that your core markets might improve before the big crane markets starts to improve?"," Well generally speaking, yes generally speaking we do only because obviously our cranes are 300,000 or 250,000 and not $2 million. So they’re going to move faster up and down then the larger - the people that deal with the larger cranes absolutely. So you’ll see, we lead and we lied because of the – or we lead on both sides, we come down faster and we grow up faster because of the sensitivity of the price."
Mike Sulewski,Andrew Rooke," Great. If I can just squeeze in one last follow-up here on that topic, I just want to make sure, do you get a sense in your core crane business - core mast crane business not the rest of it that you are maintaining your market share or is that also a concern to you?"," I think we’re holding up in the 30s, the low 30s. I think we should have all market, I think we should do better and I think we should continue to expand because we have the best product and the best distribution in the area and that's where we concentrate. But I would answer the question it seems like we are holding up our market share but obviously the market right now is unbelievably low for new cranes – for new cranes and the straight mast cranes not knuckles but straight mast cranes. We always have to distinguish that now because obviously PM is now a bigger part of our business than Manitex, we just want Manitex to get back to where they were."
Unidentified Analyst,Andrew Rooke," Terrific. Listen, just turning to the balance sheet again here, you've done a pretty good job here. The six months you knocked $20 million off the debt, another $3 million in Q3. At this pace, what do you expect this debt to EBITDA ratio? It's pretty gaudy 5.9X to adjusted EBITDA. Do you think that can get down to what's your normal, 3X to 4X?"," Well, before this latest round of acquisitions we were in the three range. We obviously want to get back to that, but realistically though what we said last quarter is if can double that $80 million, what happens is you have seen the schedules that kick in 6 and 12 months. So I expect that we'll have -- I don't suspect, I know we'll have some more payment schedules in this, in December time period that will kick. So, we'll have some more reductions in our debt. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a significant amount of inventory that we -- much more than what we normally carry. And we will try to, we have ways to move that through the rental channels especially in the fourth quarter. So, our plans to move more than what we did in the third quarter. More in line with what we did in the first half. Certainly we take the starting of the year to 11, if you take down your hope somewhere between $30 million to $40 million for the year, again, that's a hope not a, we'll take it, but that's what we're trying to do. And then obviously if we have enough of sale, that helps, and the next year we do the same thing. Then go back and we do a better or we have better markets and better improvement on our EBITDA, then our ratios are going to fall back into line than what has happened. And it's also part of the calculation and that movement from 5.4 to 5.9, and has been certainly improving or not improving, but detriment during the year is the fact that you have some pretty decent EBITDA numbers last year and the year before. And that was primarily Manitex driven. And of course now, Manitex, is way down. So, you're kind of losing part of the engine that really drove the EBITDA numbers."
Unidentified Analyst,Andrew Rooke,Sure.," So, the calculation is being affected by the fact that your EBITDA numbers are down."
Unidentified Analyst,Andrew Rooke,Right.," Our overall EBITDA is up. We did $20 million last year, we did $23 million through the first nine months year. But that's all from the -- primarily from the new acquisitions, not from the old Manitex, Company."
Unidentified Analyst,David Langevin," Yes, turning a little bit to ASV's for a moment, just my second question here. These 50 locations you add and going to 100, that sounds like a very aggressive plan to me. ASV if I recall is a huge company before the 2008 depression kicked him in the pants. Can you give me an idea of the competitive landscape for ASV in the U.S."," I wouldn't say it was huge, but it was a substantial company before the great recession. And Andrew, do you want to talk more specifically about the expansion from 50 to 100, you certainly are closer to that."
Unidentified Analyst,David Langevin,All right. Thank you very much.," This is David again. Building of a brand or the rebuilding of the ASV brand and the rebuilding of ASV distribution, it's -- we're not apples. So, you're not going to see Andrew dancing on TV commercials trying to build the brand. But the way we do this is obviously some of these announcements that we've made in the last month regarding ASV, it's just trying to bring more attention to your brand in the marketplace. And to build the spirit and the opportunity that you have for our dealers, and as I see this, people want to become part of it. So, that's why we're trying to really bring as much attention as we can, and as Andrew said, the team has done a great job of building and rebuilding the brand."
