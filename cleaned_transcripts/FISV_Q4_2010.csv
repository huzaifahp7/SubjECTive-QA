Glenn Greene,Jeffery Yabuki," I guess, the first question, just wanted to ask, talk about sort of the market, the macro sales climate and sort of the industry growth expectation. At your Analyst Day, just back in October, you sort of talked about 3% growth for the market. It kind of sounded like maybe you were tempering that a bit. I'm not sure if I heard that right. And if it is still 3%, I was just sort of curious that the midpoint of your internal growth is sort of smack in the range there."," Sure. So Glenn, when we were at Investor Day, we talked about our belief that over the next few years, that IT spending for the sector would average around 3% over that period. But that would build over the next several years, and we didn't expect that to be a flat line over the period and we see 2011 building into that average. So if you just use some simple math, you would expect it to be arguably lowest in 2011 and highest in 2013, just if you were seeing that kind of a bill. And our guidance contemplates that kind of a bill. Arguably, we've seen more optimism in the space over the last few months than we've seen really all of last year. That was apparent in our pipeline. It was apparent in our sales results, and frankly, there's a good level of optimism. I think we're taking a more measured and pragmatic approach, knowing that we need to see more than a month or two or three to believe that's enough to base all of our guidance on. So we're really using data points that stretch back from what we saw during the majority of 2010, what we're seeing more recently and the sales results that we had during the year. So all of that measures up to be, we would say, we're slightly more optimistic or I would say our clients are slightly more optimistic than they were several months ago. And we'd like to see that continue over the next quarters or two.",,,,,,
Glenn Greene,Jeffery Yabuki," And then different direction, maybe a little bit of commentary related to Durbin as it relates to exclusivity, just sort of what you're hearing coming out of D.C. and sort of potential for you. Or how are you sort of thinking about the opportunity as it relates to exclusivity, specifically on PIN side?"," Sure. So I mean, clearly, the first cut at the Durbin rules made that about as clear as you could be that that's going to end up being the standard. Now perhaps that will change, but certainly the first cut looked like that. And we believe that given the success that we've had with the ACCEL/Exchange network over the last few years and the conversations that we're having right now, I would say that's one of the areas that we would say there is reasonable opportunity. And we will continue to work with the marketplace to try to take advantage of those opportunities where it makes sense for the clients and us. Again, I think it's too soon to call that, but we feel good about the conversations that we're having today and again, believe that to extent there's benefit to be derived from the marketplace, it will be one of the beneficiaries of that opportunity.",,,,,,
David Koning,Thomas Hirsch," First of all, I just wanted to look at the margin progression. This year, the FI margins were up about 100 basis points for the full year, and Payments were down about 40 basis points for the full year. I'm just wondering, if you can just review that again. I remember, I know on different calls you talked about that, but now we have a full year under our belt. Maybe you can just talk about that a little. And then, how do you look at the segments going forward? Would you expect both to expand in 2011?"," Yes. Absolutely, Dave. That's a great question. I would say of the Payments side, as you highlighted, our margins were down. I think that is the area that we have made more investments. And as you know, most of our investments continue to run through our income statement, our P&L, because a lot of that is headcount-related. And Jeff went through some of the items, I think, in his remarks, but around ZashPay, around mobile, in our debit business, in our bill payment business, in our online channel, online banking business, which, as you know, we've had some second wins there; in our Biller solutions business, which we kind of highlighted at Investor Day. So those areas have been incremental areas of investment to really drive longer term growth. So we have invested in there in those opportunities, and we'll continue to do so going forward because we think that's very important to drive growth in 2011, '12 and beyond. And so I would say it's really a higher level of investment in there. Nothing's really changed from the margin characteristics of that business. But again, we just continue to invest more there because there are more opportunities to really grow our top line in that particular area. In the Financial segment, we just continued through our operational effectiveness initiatives, et cetera. And also the check processing business, which I know we talked about before, as that kind of electronifies, we kind of pick up on the margin end. But we also have very good scale businesses as you know, Dave, in the Financial segment in our account processing area. As we continue to sign those core clients and put them on to our platform, we really have some good scale businesses there. So we're going to continue to see good increases going forward. Our guidance next year is 50 basis points plus depending on the level of investment. But we're going to continue to see good margin expansion. As you know, we've done about 700, 650 basis points over the last four to five years, had a good year this year, and finished the year really at a record level from a margin standpoint in the quarter. So we feel good about that going into next year.",,,,,,
David Koning,Thomas Hirsch," And then two real quick ones, just term fees in the quarter and will StoneRiver continue to generate about the same affiliate income for you even now that they paid out the $89 million? I guess just those two quick ones."," Yes. Dave, on the first one, yes, we had about $4 million of term fees, which is up, I think, $2 million to $3 million over the fourth quarter of last year. Our license fees were still down slightly over last year. Though also in the quarter, they were down about $4 million to $5 million. But we still had a good quarter sequentially in license revenue over the third quarter. And so good there, but term fees were up very small again in the current year from that standpoint. Regarding the StoneRiver question, to highlight what you said, is we did get a dividend and loan lower repayment of about $89 million, $90 million. We did back that out of our free cash flow, but that should not impact their equity earnings going forward. So as far as their level going into next year, it should be right around the same level or so.",,,,,,
Bryan Keane,Jeffery Yabuki," My first question is just about the Check business. I know, Jeff, you noted that as that business volumes are declining. I guess, can you size that business for us? And I guess going into 2012, is it just becoming so small and it's not going to be material by then?"," Yes. The business is in the $200 million, $250 million range in terms of overall revenues. And the drag, or the percent size of the drag, is pretty material. That's why we called it out this year, but there's another factor. So it's not just that you have people writing less checks, but you have many more people converting those paper checks, specifically at merchant, like converting paper checks to electronic or whatever the case maybe. And so you have not just less checks, but you have less paper overall in the system. And that's really a function of all of the capture, the remote capture, and things like that, that have been moved in the system over the last few years. As that has gotten up to scale, that's tipping or accelerating the level of decline in that business. Now again, that will level out at some point, but it's going to continue to drag on us for a while.",,,,,,
Bryan Keane,Thomas Hirsch," And then I just want to ask about the operational effectiveness of $25 million. I guess that's kind of below last year's objective of $40 million, and I know the goal is, over five years, $250 million. So can you just help us understand, is that number get greater as we go forward?"," Yes, it will continue to build, Bryan. And that really is the same number that we presented on Investor Day, so that $25 million, because the next area of savings in the $250 million comprises of data center transformation and a number of other areas. But that $25 million ramps up significantly to year two to over $50 million. We're not giving guidance on that right now. But clearly, it's going to ramp up, and we have our plans. We're executing alone those plans and continue to refine those to accelerate as much of that as we can into 2011, keeping in mind the quality of our delivery and pacing that correctly over the next few years. So we are continue to refine those plans. Mark is going to be helping a lot in that regard to execute that over the next five years, and we remain very confident in our ability to be able to obtain that $250 million.",,,,,,
Christopher Shutler,Jeffery Yabuki," Jeff, looking at the 2% to 4% internal revenue growth guidance, what are kind of the one or two biggest swing factors, particularly get to the high end of that range?"," Yes, I would say it's the biggest opportunity that exists today. And earlier in 2010, early in the year in '10 -- sorry, I was getting my year straight -- we had talked about the fact that there were some larger transactions that we were in pursuit of. Some of them we could announce publicly, and some of them we could not announce publicly. And one of those happen to be WestPac, and we announced that it was a large transaction. Well, during the year, we ended up winning the transactions we thought we would be able to win. We didn't announce them because they were not announceable, but these are transactions that will be implemented over time. And the constraints that we have are really around having to contend with resource constraints within these very large financial institutions. We have to effectively get into their development queues. And some of the projects that we are working on, to the extent they can be moved in earlier, would have upside into our numbers for 2011. So that's the upside. I think on the downside, to the extent that the economy itself begins to deteriorate down to levels below what we saw last year in 2010, I think that would create some downside in our numbers. Beyond that, I would say that on balance, we would say there's probably more opportunity in our numbers if the economy stays as strong as people are talking about it staying right now. But we just don't see any reason, Chris, to get ahead of ourselves. We feel like we've got a reputation of doing what you say you're going to do, and that's what we're focused on right now.",,,,,,
Christopher Shutler,Jeffery Yabuki," And then second question is actually on e-bills, grew about 2% to 3% this year. How confident are you guys that, that growth rate can materially accelerate at some point either in '11 or '12 off of that base? And then with Wells taking their bill pay in-house, how do you think about the risk of other large FIs doing the same thing?"," Sure. Those are great questions. I'm going to take the latter one first, then we'll come back. Wells Fargo did not take their bill pay business in-house. Wells Fargo, a number of years ago, spent significant money and built their own bill payment system. What they did is they bought Wachovia back in '08, I guess it was, or '09 now, early '09. And they planned all along to convert that. They began converting the Wachovia business over to their own proprietary system, and they plan to complete that in 2010. So that's what happened in that case. And as it relates to others, I mean, we're very close to -- not surprising, we're very close to what's going on in the market. Beyond Bank of America, which is a well known large client of ours, Wachovia was about a 1% client of ours, we have a handful of other clients, bill payment clients, that are, I'll call it, 0.5%. And then beyond that, there's little concentration, and even 0.5% is not material concentration. The great news is we have renewed, most of it, not all of those agreements, over the last 18 months and we feel quite comfortable with that base of clients. So from that standpoint, we don't see any current risks. So that's the good news.",,,,,,
Christopher Shutler,Jeffery Yabuki," And then just final question, on ZashPay. Looks like you're charging, just on looking at the website, about $0.75 per transaction on your own website. But I'd just be curious to hear how you're seeing most of the FIs at this point price the product or, if most, are giving it away?"," Chris, I will get to that e-bill question that I forgot to answer to. I got slapped by Tom for that. But on ZashPay, yes, on the consumer side, we are charging $0.75. But most of financial institutions right now are looking at this. They see it to be a very high-value solution. They think it's going to move into the kind of the daily habits of their consumers, and they see it as a way to build fee revenue. So most of the clients that we're talking to right now are looking at ways to either charge for it. Many of them have already implemented and are charging for the send element. And I've heard some clients talk about, well, if you use a debit card x number of times, they'll let you have Zash transactions. So there are a variety of ways that you can bundle these solutions to try to create more value for clients. So my guess is it's going to become a fee generating item, and I think it will actually be quite helpful over the next several years for financial institutions as they look for that fee revenue. Just a quick comment on the e-bill. We continue to think e-bill is critical, not just for the fact that it unlocks growth, but it's ordinarily differentiating us as it relates to bill payment experience. Tom, I think, mentioned that we are investing in our Biller area and through our SmartConnect product. And so we are investing there. You'll hear more about that over the next year, and we are maniacally focused on unlocking some of the value that exists there. You may remember, we've got, call it, $100 million of embedded latent revenue that's sitting there. And it's a fixed cost business, so there's a lot of opportunity there. So we are focused on that as well.",,,,,,
Greg Smith,Thomas Hirsch," Tom, the tax rate in 2011 is 37.5% about where we should look at?"," I think that's in the range. It's going to be slightly better than 2010, which I'd say which is around 38%.",,,,,,
Greg Smith,Thomas Hirsch," And then the high tax rate in the quarter that clipped you for $0.02, when did you sort of know that, I guess, is the question? I mean, is it fair to say that, that was unexpected by you guys? It certainly was by me?"," Yes, it's fairly -- I mean, we had an item there that was associated with our equity investment, which was fairly unusual. It's a noncash item, Greg. So again, it has nothing to do with what we're ultimately going to pay in taxes. And it just was a FASB 109 requirement, so recorded that. It was offset a little bit by the R&D tax credit, but it's about $0.02 negative impact in the quarter for those two items.",,,,,,
Greg Smith,Jeffery Yabuki," I know it's de minimis, the float income. I guess the question is, what's it going to take to actually move that? Is it going to take the Fed actually raising rates because you invest at all such short term? Is that the case?"," That's correct, yes. So it's going to take exactly what you said.",,,,,,
Greg Smith,Thomas Hirsch,And is there a rule of thumb what's the latest 1% move in the fed funds rate what that would do to EPS?," I think if we give 1% or so, it's $0.02 for every 1% that we kind of have.",,,,,,
David Togut,Thomas Hirsch," First, Tom, could you comment on unit pricing that you've seen in the last six months both in the Financial segment and the Payments segment and then what you see going forward in 2011?"," Yes, I think, David, we appreciate that question. And I think from a compression standpoint, which I think is what you're referring to, is the market continues to be competitive. We have not seen a great change over the last six months as far as pricing goes. There hasn't been any improvements or really any detriment from that standpoint. So that continues on about the pace it was. We clearly run the situations, as we always do, where competitors want to get into a certain client and/or a certain area, and that does happen on occasion where it can get aggressive. But overall, there really hasn't been a significant change in the environment over the last six months. Jeff, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.",,,,,,
David Togut,Thomas Hirsch," And then the second question relates to capital allocation. And specifically, Tom, what is your appetite to buy back stock at current prices? And perhaps, if you could compare that to your appetite to acquire at current valuations."," Well, as you know, David, and as you followed the company over the last several years, from a capital allocation standpoint, share repurchase is our capital allocation benchmark. We continue to be buyers of our stock. We run an intrinsic value model inside the company clearly from that standpoint, and we'll continue to be buyers of our stock because that is really the benchmark that we use. And we continue to look clearly at acquisitions in the marketplace as we always do, but we do compare that. That's our capital allocation benchmark, and I think our history speaks for itself as far as what we've done in that particular area.",,,,,,
Brett Huff,Thomas Hirsch," Two quick questions. One is, can you tell us just more specifically about the very nice margin expansion that you saw in the Financial segment? You detailed a little bit, but I wanted to make sure that I understood exactly all the moving parts on that. And going forward, you called out a few things that will help continue with that cost savings and things like that. But will the thing that happened in the fourth quarter repeat itself?"," Well, I think we don't -- the fourth quarter, let me just talk about the quarter for a moment. We did have a lot of good growth there from a top line. If you compare it to the third quarter right, revenues were up in that particular segment, about $20 million. Most of that dropped to the bottom line. Typically, in the fourth quarter, Brett, we do have some good purchasing from clients as far as license revenue goes compared to the third quarter. So when you compare the Q4 to Q3, we just had a lot of good incremental drop through in that particular quarter because, really, our license revenue in that particular segment was up on a sequential basis. And we had a really solid quarter from that standpoint as far as that drop through goes. And in comparison to the quarter four of last year, again, good mix of revenue. But also, we have some discretionary compensation expenses last year, which did not recur in the current year, which helped that year-over-year comparison. But I think going forward, we look at margins, sometimes these licensees will fall into the fourth quarter, sometimes into the third, sometimes into the second. But overall, we're going to continue to grow our margins in both of our segments. We continue to have a number of opportunities, and we continue to have more outsourcing revenue in this segment. And we have, again, good scale businesses. We have our new $250 million target for operational effectiveness. We have a lot of things going on in our check business with electronification, and so we continue to have some solid opportunities there.",,,,,,
Brett Huff,Jeffery Yabuki," And then last question, on the two large clients that are having a little bit slower growth on bill pay, what's the game plan to address that? I mean, how much help can you provide them? What are the others solutions or things around the edges that you can help maybe restart some of that growth? Or is that just an economy or even just a saturation thing?"," Well, it's a little bit of a different story for each one. I would say on balance, we try really hard to help point out areas of potential growth. But in the case of our largest client, they're at a penetration rate that is probably 1 to 2x larger, right. They're penetration rate is 1 to 2x that of everyone else. So there's a lot of opportunity for everyone else to get up to their rate. For them to really grow significantly, they would have to do some things that would be fairly different. And unfortunately, right now, given everything that's going on in the economy, I don't think people -- the institutions aren't spending a disproportionately large amount of their time focused on how to do move that forward. So I don't think there's a lot we can do there beyond changing and modifying our own experience to make it even more differentiating than it is today and easier to transact. And that's part of how we think about our own technology in terms of doing that.",,,,,,
Darrin Peller,Thomas Hirsch," Just a quick question. First on, can you just help us understand how much payments margins are being impacted collectively by the investments in some of the newer initiatives?"," Darrin, I'm not going to go specifically into that. All I'll say is that our core businesses, both in bill payment, debit, et cetera, continue to have nice pull-through. But from a standpoint of incremental margins, those businesses and how they operate and the incremental drop through margin continues to be very positive. But we are making these critical investments in a number of different areas, and we talked about them already",,,,,,
Darrin Peller,Thomas Hirsch," I mean, I may have missed it, but is that driving the margin drop down and the payments year-over-year, payments margin?"," Yes, that's correct. That's been going on all year end, and that's really where a lot of our investment as a company is focused. And Darrin, I think earlier I addressed this question, but the issue around most of our growth comes through headcount, which is expensed. And if you look back, we were investing in seven or eight or nine different things here that are very critical to us and will help our growth rate as we get into '11 and '12 and '13. So they're critical things, and we're very excited about.",,,,,,
Darrin Peller,Jeffery Yabuki," I guess on the topic of margins, I mean, you put up a nice margin expansion, 70 basis points over last year. And I think that was on revenue growth of about 1.5%. When we consider your guidance of 3% to 4%, and we also note that about 60% of your revenues are transaction processing-driven, like you said, scalable. I mean, I would have expected to see more than 50 basis points margin upside just given the revenue pick up. So that's I guess why I'm trying to figure out, understanding why it wouldn't be more than 50 basis points. Is it just because of the payments growth initiatives?"," Darrin, I would say first of all, and this maybe how we talk about this, I would accentuate the 'at least' part of that. You said at least 50 basis points. We're not saying nor are we saying it will be 50. Try to have me say that again. It's just kind of our normal guidance, we've now just adopted it. So it's at least 50 basis points. So I would not necessarily use 50 basis points as the right answer.",,,,,,
Darrin Peller,Jeffery Yabuki," Jeff, last question for you. When do you see the client base seemingly getting through some of their inhibitions around spending over regulatory reasons?",When do we see the spending loosening up?,,,,,,
Darrin Peller,Jeffery Yabuki," Yes, when do you see the concern by some of your clients abating, I guess, is really where I'm getting at. Where I'm going, I mean."," Yes, I mean, really, it's a rules question. Once there are rules, I think people will know what they can do and what they can't do. And when the Durbin rule, first cut of the rules, were introduced, I mean, there's been a lot of noise in the system obviously because of that. I think we have to get the proposed regulatory changes quantified and have people on -- and as soon as they understand them, I think people will move past. I think really the issue is understanding what is going to happen. If they were final, things would be a lot better, no matter what they are. They just need to be final, and people will move on.",,,,,,
John Williams,Jeffery Yabuki," I was just curious, we haven't really heard a lot in the way of commentary on the larger bank core upgrade cycle. I know a lot of us have sort of hitched our views to the smaller and the midsized banks coming back. But what color can you give us on the bigger banks and those bigger projects? Are you seeing anything different now versus a few months back?"," Well, John, I would say that if the question was directed at the size of projects, there are some magnificently large projects out there. They just tend not to be in the U.S. They tend not to be core-centric. I mean, there are some core changes going on outside the U.S. And frankly, there is one or two large core changes going on here. But in the U.S., we're just not hearing a lot of energy on core. Most of the energy that we're hearing tends to focus around channel, right. So around Internet banking, that's a big topic around the world right now, lots and lots of renewal and these are very, very large projects that are going on. So that we are hearing. But domestically, there is not a lot discussion, real discussion, around core renewal because that's just not differentiating from the consumer perspective. And I think until people are able to move on with the business of banking, I just don't see them putting the energy, and that it would take to do. If you can imagine, one of the top three or four banks doing a core change, I just don't see it.",,,,,,
John Williams,Jeffery Yabuki," Just to go back to one of the earlier questions on PIN debit specifically. I know historically, you guys really haven't been all that active at the point-of-sale. It seems like most of the cards are ATM network-oriented cards. I guess, what specifically can you do if indeed Durbin does disaggregate some of the volumes away from the bigger networks on PIN debit? What can you do specifically to try and capture some more point-of-sale volumes? Because that seems like the biggest way that you guys could actually and maybe make a dent in the industry if you can grab some more of those volumes."," I would say, John, over the last several years -- and when you were making that comment, it made me think we probably hadn't done a good job talking about this. We've actually spent a lot of energy and effort over the last few years in expanding our presence at point-of-sale. I think we're about a 98% or 99% acceptance at this point through the U.S. through our direct efforts and some partnerships that we formed. So we're out there. It's one of the reasons why the ACCEL/Exchange network has been growing rapidly, and it's one of the reasons why we're involved in a lot of the conversations that are occurring around industry right now in kind of what I would call the second network conversation. So I agree with you. There's a lot of opportunity there, and we hope that we will be a benefactor of that as the rules become final and as people make choices, if in fact the rules require that.",,,,,,
David Parker,Mark Ernst," Just wondering if we could actually get Mark to comment on his decision to join the team, and just how he views his role going forward and what he will be focused on initially?"," Sure, David. Probably the thing that I was most attracted to in looking at Fiserv is the management team. I've known a number of folks, not just Jeff, but a number of people who are part of the management team for a while. And so the opportunity to work with people who I respect, who I think have a lot of passion for the business and serving their clients in a way that this management team seems to want to serve clients, was very attractive to me. I also believe that there is a lot of opportunity to think hard and look long and hard about how to be innovative and create new sources of revenue growth for this company. And I find that to be an interesting challenge that I'm excited about. And clearly, Fiserv as I think you know probably as well as I do, is in the midst of a transformation from what it was in the earliest kind of incarnation of the company to Fiserv 2.0. And while a lot of progress seems to have been made, there's still a lot of opportunities. So things like this $250 million expense challenge, this next stage is fundamental restructuring in the way in which the business gets done as opposed to just simply costs take outs. That's fascinating. For a business guy like me, that's fascinating work to figure out how to do that and not just take out costs but enhance quality for clients at the same time. So it's just an interesting opportunity to work with some really good people and do really interesting work.",,,,,,
Tien-Tsin Huang,Thomas Hirsch," I just have a couple of quick ones so you guys can go. Just the capital question I wanted to ask, I think 2.5 turns of leverage, is that still the leverage target you guys expect just to stay true to you through this year or do we see that change? I asked because it could imply heavy repurchase activity again this year absent any deals."," No, our target is 2, 2.5x and we're within that range of that target. We're going to continue to allocate capital, some to debt repayment. But again, we're going to be focused on share repurchase as we have been in the past as our capital allocation benchmark.",,,,,,
Tien-Tsin Huang,Thomas Hirsch," I just want to make sure because your guidance does assume some level of repurchase then, right?"," Yes, absolutely. As far as allocating our capital.",,,,,,
Tien-Tsin Huang,Jeffery Yabuki," Just the bill pay outlook. Jeff, I know you and I talked about this before and I figured to ask it again, see if things have changed. Just wanted your thoughts on what lower debit interchange means for your bill pay outlook. Again, I think I could certainly argue it's positive and negative, but just wanted your thoughts on that."," And Tien-Tsin, are you talking about our classic CheckFree bill pay?",,,,,,
Tien-Tsin Huang,Jeffery Yabuki," Yes, classic CheckFree bill pay, not the walk in or the other stuff, just bill pay and I guess on the tail of that, the e-bill as well. Just with the cost of taking debit being cheaper, could we see more Biller Direct? Or because you have more optionality now with debit, could you see it open up more billers to take it and it all being aggregated under the banks. I'm just trying to get a feel for how that shakes out because I'm still kind of confused by it."," No, I understand, and I think we're all working our way through the complexity of what will happen. At least from my standpoint, I'm still a firm believer in the aggregator model. And so whether debit creates another quasi form of payment, and especially if you can put a rewards umbrella around that and does that begin to help bill pay, I think you might begin to see some different economics. As different economic models emerge, I think you could see rewards end up centering around, not just transactions, but around bill pay and other kinds of services that aren't currently covered by that. So I think the Biller Direct is certainly going to be an option for people who like Biller Direct. But at the end of the day, I think the aggregator model wins. And I especially believe that mobile, as a way to allow people easier access kind of when they want that access, will actually accelerate trends towards aggregators. And as we talked about before, we do believe that bill payment follows bills, and the propagation of e-bill is getting that right. I actually think it begins to diminish the Biller Direct value proposition because you have the amounts and the other relevant information right at your fingertips. So kind of a long-winded way of saying we still believe in the aggregation model. We think Biller Direct is there to stay. We do a lot of that work, but we think that the aggregating model will win even in a period or a time of lower interchange. Depending on if that continues in that form, I guess, will also play a role in the ultimate decision. Well, thank you, everyone for joining. And if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to follow up with our Investor Relations group. Have a good night.",,,,,,
