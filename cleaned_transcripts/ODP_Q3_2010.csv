Asker,Responder,Question,Answer
Mitchell Kaiser,Kevin Peters," Piper Jaffray. You talk a little bit about the Windows 7 launch. You talked a little bit about the windows 7 launch.  Could you just talk about where your thoughts are on the tablet and the e-reader impact on the computing category, and maybe what your strategy is on a go-forward basis?"," This is Kevin. I'll take the question on the tablet. I think the tablet certainly are here to stay with the launch of the iPad earlier this year. There are several million iPad tablets in the market. I think data that's published from a number of sources would suggest that it certainly impacted not only the netbook market, but it's also impacted the laptop, and in some respects, even the smartphone market. So I think it's a choice that both consumers and small businesses will make in terms of their computing needs. So therefore, for us, having a presence in the tablet category, we think it is important. We've picked a couple of tablets that we plan to have as part of our offer in the fourth quarter, specifically for our small and medium business customers. We've also enhanced our offering of accessories both for Apple products, as well as other makers of not only tablets and smartphones. Short answer is tablets are here to stay. I think they'll be an evolution. It seems as though every week somebody is getting in the tablet market, so we'll try to stay at least on pace or ahead of that curve."
Mitchell Kaiser,Kevin Peters,So is the expectation that you'll have those in the fourth quarter here in a meaningful way?,Yes.
Mitchell Kaiser,Kevin Peters,And then just on Florida and California. I think California was the big turn. Could you just talk a little bit what you're seeing in California from the delivery side and also the retail side that suggests that sequential improvement relative to Q2?," I'll take the retail piece and let Steve address BSD. I still think and if you look at California and Florida for the Retail business, it's roughly 25% of our fleet of stores. If you look at unemployment in California and Florida, it's still running about 24% or more, higher than the national average. I think the stores in California are well known. There's still a furlough that I think is in place in public government there. So I don't think California is out of the wood. That being said, for Retail in the third quarter, students and parents don't need to do back-to-school shopping. They still need the supplies to allow their students to go back-to-school equipped. And we did I think a good job, not only advertising the products that we had available for sale. We have attractive price points. And we were fortunate that when shoppers came in our stores, we were able to convert them to buyers. So we're pleased with the results in California. I think, we said they were slightly positive for the quarter. I don't know that, that's necessarily a telltale sign of what to expect in the future. I think, they've got a lot of headwind that they're going to have to navigate through."
Kate McShane,Kevin Peters," Citi Investment Research. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Furniture business? I think you highlighted it, comps positively during the quarter. There's some thought out there that it's temporary, that landlords are incentivizing businesses to move to smaller spaces. Do you have read on the sustainability of this trend?"," Kate, this is Kevin. We're very pleased with our Furniture business. We, Office Depot, for a period of time was in the Furniture business. We lost our way. Our customers have told us over time that Furniture's an important category for them. I don't think we were as relevant as we could have been. So we've made a big investment in getting back into the Furniture business. And it started really a couple of years ago, we've got an exciting private brand assortment, as well as national brands, a real we're focus on seating and modular furniture and very, very attractive price points, not only within the OSS space but perhaps more importantly, even within the broader retail. So I think, we're increasingly becoming a destination for furniture, data from NPD, which is a private source that provide market share, would probably confirm that. And at this point, we don't see any softness on the near-term horizon for the Furniture category."
Kate McShane,Kevin Peters," My second question is on private label. It sounded like it contributed positively to gross margins both in retail and delivery. Did you have a notable increase in penetration of private label? Did that increase as a percentage of sales, or Is it mix and what customers are trading to?",Probably more of the latter than the former.
Anthony Chukumba,Neil Austrian," It's Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Not to sort of beat a dead horse here, but more interested in Steve's departure just in respect of what role did BC partners play, I guess,in the  mutual decision? And then just a follow-up, what role would BC Partners play in the selection of the new CEO?"," BC Partners is on the board. They had the same votes, if I might want to call it vote, because we never voted as such, as all the other board members. So they did not play any role other than as a board member. And they're good board members. This was not a BC Partners issue at all. In terms of the search process, there are five board members on the search committee and Jamie Rubin of BC Partners will be one of the five."
Unidentified Analyst,Charles Brown," It's Joscelyn MacKay from Morningstar. I just had a really quick question for International. With regards to that annual sale, I believe, you said was moved to the fourth quarter of this year versus last year, it was in the third quarter? Would you be able to quantify the impact of that?"," No, I can't quantify the impact. Every year, we have our anniversary sale. And it's a three-day event. It tends to drive -- it tends to be very promotional so the margins are not at the level that they normally are in our retail stores. But it does tend to drive a lot of top line sales. it drives a lot of foot traffic due to stores. So I think the main call out was that we were actually positive despite not having the positive sales percent perspective without that sale, and we'll not have those sales in of the fourth quarter."
Brian Turcotte,Neil Austrian," Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's current expectations concerning future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, could cause actual results to differ materially. A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, during the conference call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as our press release and accompanying webcast slides for today's call, are available on our website at www.officedepot.com. Click on Investor Relations under Company Information. Office Depot's interim Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Neil Austrian, will now make a few comments. Neil?"," Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Office Depot's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. With me today are Mike Newman, Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Peters, President of North American Retail; Steve Schmidt, President of North American Business Solutions; and our International President, Charlie Brown. As most, if not all, of you in the call and webcast this morning are aware, Steve Odland announced his resignation from Office Depot effective November 1, 2010, by mutual agreement with the Board of Directors earlier this week. We want to thank Steve for his contributions to our company beginning in 2005 and through one of the toughest economic climates in memory. During his tenure, the company grew and achieved record revenue and profits, and we've seen some improvement in margins coming out of the depths of the recession. Now that the worst of the recession is behind us and margins are improving, we believe that this is an appropriate time to seek new leadership to make the most of the platform we have in place, return to sales growth, improved financial performance and reinvigorate our franchise.  We all wish Steve well. As you may have read, we agreed to pay $1 million to settle an SEC investigation regarding communications with analysts and other matters previously disclosed. This settlement puts a definitive end and to investigation that started in 2007, and throughout which, Office Depot cooperated fully with the SEC. The company chose to settle, in order to return its full focus to the business and to serving its customers. I want to make absolutely clear that Steve Odland's resignation was not prompted, in any way, by the settlement with the SEC as some have speculated. Looking forward, we're committed to taking the time needed to find the right leader for Office Depot for the future. In the meantime, I'll be very actively engaged in carrying out our strategic plan in helping the company to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll ask Mike to summarize our third quarter 2010 results. Mike?"
Matthew Fassler,Neil Austrian," Its Goldman Sachs. I've got one strategic question for Neil and then a financial question for Mike. Neil, my question to you would be, if you could you talk about the timing of the board's decision, why now? I know you said that the SEC settlement did not factor into your thinking, but to the extent that this is a mutual call by you and by Steve. What did the board see that drove the timing on its end?"," Hi, Matt. Good morning. I think there's basically, never a good time to make a change. And I think in this situation, we were starting to see a return to some of the economic positives that we'd experienced in the past. We were beginning to see margin improvement. We were beginning to see the situation from a total economy standpoint bottom out. Yet at the same time, no one was 100% pleased with the results. And basically, we both concluded that now was a good a time as any. And I want to reiterate, it didn't have anything to do with the SEC issue. If you use a sports analogy, at sometime, you make a quarterback change, and there's never good time to do that, and you're never 100% certain if it's going to work, but on the field, there is an emotion, there's a spark, there's an energy level that the whole team gets from that kind of change. And I think, both of us at this point, felt that, that was probably necessary."
Matthew Fassler,Michael Newman," And then secondly, for Mike, when you look at the inventory dynamic, your inventory growth was a bit unfavorable to your sales trends. And that was, I believe, reversal of trends that we had seen, leading up to the certainty versus where we were last quarter. If you could give us a sense as to what contributed to that and kind of where inventory stand and where the inventory lives right now?"," Actually, when we talk about flow in the quarter and the contribution to cash flow, we're actually really pleased with the inventory levels. If you look at what's driving flow for the quarter, it's mostly driven by increases in accounts payable from last year. But what didn't happen, with that increasing accounts payable was an increase in inventory. We certainly had great sell through on back-to-school inventory. We had great sell through on overstock, in clearance items and inventory. And we also had some operational changes in the way that we're managing the supply chain on ink and toner that we think are going to be permanent. So I'm actually very pleased from a flow perspective, with the payable in inventory numbers for the quarter, principally for those reasons."
Colin McGranahan,Neil Austrian," It's Sanford Bernstein. first question for NeI'll, just following up on Matt's question. As you think about getting, I guess, spark back on the field, what kind of quarterback are you looking for? What are the characteristics and quality, the new leadership that you're pursuing at this point?"," I think the specs are pretty obvious, Colin. I think that you want someone who's an absolute proven leader, somebody who's run a major business, somebody who in the past has not only demonstrated their ability to control thoughts and innovate, but someone that can build revenue. We're not going to cost cut our way out of the problem here, going forward for the next decade. We've got to build revenues. You'd like to find somebody that has both retail, and what I'll call, BSD experience. It's a very tough position to fill. I think we've hired the right search firm in Heidrick & Struggles. They've already gotten started. And our expectations are that given the liquidity we have in the company, given the management team that we have in place and given the starting change in the economy, we're going to find a superior CEO to come in and take the company to the next level."
Colin McGranahan,Neil Austrian," And how important is it that, that best person has any familiarity with office products?"," I can't answer that today. All I can say is as an analogy, I was on the research team at DirecTV when Chase Carey went back to News Corp., and our initial specs to get a CEO were to find somebody that knew the media entertainment or television business. And then out of the box, candidate Mike White, who had been Vice Chairman of Pepsi and the former CFO of Pepsi came in, and he's doing an extraordinary job. So I don't want to rule out anybody at this point."
Colin McGranahan,Michael Newman," And then a question for Mike. Of the $80 million you've identified in OpEx and cost reductions, where are you today? And how much of the G&A reduction that we saw in the third quarter, I think, it was down more than $20 million year-over-year -- how much of that was from efforts that are already underway on the process improvement?"," The decrease to last year was more due to things that are already been in place plus some non-recurring things from last year. Of the $80 million, we're not -- as I mentioned in the script, I really don't want to get into a year-over-year update, but we're making a lot of strong progress. I feel as good as I could feel sitting here looking at 2011 and looking at us making considerable traction towards delivering that $80 million in three years. Our teams are working hard, we've got a lot of buy-in from the organization, and we've got a lot of great process workshops going that my folks are running. And I really feel that as if this thing is getting a lot of traction. I do want to give specifics, but I feel like we're well on our way to delivering that $80 million given where we are today."
Colin McGranahan,Michael Newman," Just on gross margin, it's still an improvement fifth quarter in a row but the least improvement we've seen in a while. But gross margins are still more than 200 basis points below historical levels in the 30 to 31.5 range. I know there's probably a 100 bps there on rent deleverage, but what needs to happen to get the rest of that 100 to 150 basis points back?"," Yes, I think it's general leverage across the company. I think, rent is the key piece. We're talking about a number of programs to take the level of rent down, but it's leveraged across the company. It's also our contract business and we're working hard at looking at improving profitability there. Steve talked about the customer savings programs and some initiatives there, but those are the pieces I would highlight as why we're short based on your question."
Christopher Horvers,Neil Austrian," Thanks, JPMorgan. I want to follow up on the timing question, Neil. And reflecting back a few months ago, I guess, February, March time frame, you re-upped Steve's contract and added a three-year retention package, which frankly, was just kind of exchanging value for his option to leave around this time of the year, given the changes of control costs. So I just want to follow up and really understand the timing, and what's really changed versus six or seven months ago?"," I think, as I said, it's really a coincidence. The contract discussions got started a while back, given the BC Partners investment and the change in control issued. They only got signed in the first quarter, so you're really looking at a time period there, where we've had almost nine to 10 months from the time the discussion started about changing the contract or renewing the contract with the effective  event that we have this week. So it was just one of these things, where as I said earlier, there's never a good time to make a change. Both sides decided that it was appropriate at this point. And again, we want to say, it had nothing to do with the SEC issue. It was unfortunate that it's come out that way, but that's not the facts."
Christopher Horvers,Neil Austrian," As a follow-up, as you compare it to when you brought Steven in 2005, and he did a great job early on and the recession's been really tough. But how maybe is the lens that you're looking through for the search different today versus what it was in late 2004?"," I think it's going to be in some ways, more difficult to find a good new CEO. In other ways, it's going to be easier. It's going to be easier because from my perspective, and that's my lens, there is a far more solid and more in-depth management team here at the company today than when I was here in 2004. And I think that's a huge positive. I also think that the reason it may well take a little bit longer is because of the economy, and because of the fact that we've had two changes in the last 10 years and somebody on the outside may wonder if this is an appropriate time to make a change."
Christopher Horvers,Michael Newman," Mike, as a follow-up on the expense side. On advertising, you drove sales. You drove gross margin dollars here in the third quarter with back-to-school. It sounds like in the fourth quarter, you're looking at advertising again and really causing your operating profit rate to be flat. Could you maybe quantify what the step up in advertising was in the third or fourth quarter? And how are you thinking about advertising, I guess, more holistically, is this now part of building the brand so there's some upfront costs, and you assume it to pay off later? Or do you expect a more immediate term pay off?",I'll let Kevin Peters answer that.
Stephen Chick,Kevin Peters," FBR. I guess, first question is for Kevin. The comps for the quarter being flat, obviously, relative to your history that's a good trend. And I think, to date in August, you'd said, held by back-to-school, that your comp trends were slightly positive at that point. So did they split a little bit? I guess, once you kind of moved away from that back-to-school period? And if you could give us a sense kind of how the trending maybe now, and do you get back to flat for the fourth quarter? Do they need to accelerate from the trend we're looking at here today?"," We talked in August about the comp trends in North American Retail, and we said they were slightly positive at that time. As we continued to progress through the quarter, there really wasn't a material change in the comp trend. They were, if it's possible to say, less positive, and so we didn't have enough of the positive inertia to allow us to round to a positive comp. But there was not a significant drop off in the comp trends, it's just, there wasn't enough tailwind behind us to allow us to round up to a positive one. So I think that's probably the best way to characterize it."
Stephen Chick,Kevin Peters," And so as we come into the fourth quarter here, I guess, if you look at year-over-year comparisons, they sequentially get a little tougher. It sounds like you're on the trend right now to achieve what your guidance is, which would be flat for the period? I mean nothing's really changed much post quarter end?"," Yes, I think that's certainly what we've communicated. I think many of us in the retail space will have to comp over the Windows 7 launch. So we've got plans in place to address that. But that's obviously, going to be some headwind that were going to work through in the fourth quarter."
Stephen Chick,Neil Austrian," Second, if I could, I know it's small and this maybe for Charlie or maybe even Neil as well. But the sale of Israel, as I recall, if I got it right, you had just maybe closed out or exercised a put option against you to buy the minority stake of that in 2008? So was that an asset that you're proactively, I guess, approaching people for a sale or were you approached? And is it a sign of other things you might be looking at or entertaining as you look at other assets and their strategic relevance to you?"," Charlie, you want to answer that?"
Stephen Chick,Steven Schmidt," For Steve Schmidt, just on the Direct segment, the BSD, obviously, flat, it's been an improvement from where it had been. It was kind of the same as last quarter. And I was thinking that Direct would've gotten sequentially a little better. I don't know if you're kind of looking that way as well. But just given the investments that you've been making there, can you talk about what's happening competitively within Direct? And just remind me is that about a third of the BSD business?"," Steve, yes, about a third would be a good estimate. When we look at the Direct business, the combination of, obviously, our activity on the web, catalog, direct mail, e-mail, and when I look at that space, it is a highly competitive space. When you look at page search, you look at what's happening, who the different search engines. We see competition increasing significantly, the number of companies who are actually competing with us from a page-search standpoint to acquire keywords has increased significantly. We see increased activity around catalog and obviously our focus around the web. I would say generally, we're pleased with the overall performance of our Direct business. Obviously, we're involved in the whole back-to-school process, also, highly competitive. So just to see that business kind of trending flat, it is our intention to obviously return to positive growth hopefully in the near future. So no, I was not displeased in any way with our performance. And I think we're doing a good job overall, managing the mix, both products and promotion, relative to our Direct business."
Michael Lasser,Neil Austrian," Barclays Capital. Neil, how long can we expect the process to find a permanent CEO will to take place? And what will be your priorities in day-to-day involvement in the business as you're in the interim CEO role?"," My wife said if we had somebody by Thanksgiving, she'd be thrilled. We both know that's not going to happen. I don;t think we want to set a timetable, because I think we want to find the best person we can. If you look at the last search, it too somewhere, six plus months, plus or minus, I think that's probably as good an estimate as you can make at this point in time to do the search right. In terms of priorities, I think what my plan really is to sit with the team and find the ways we can implement the strategic plan, which I think is the right plan, at the same time, spend more time trying to find revenue-building opportunities as opposed to just cost-cutting, which has to continue. And I really plan, for the next several months, just to listen, to spend as much time as I can in the organization to get a sense from the people as to what we're doing right, and where we can make improvements. I think we've got a very good team in place at this point, which gives me a lot of encouragement that I think we're moving in the right direction."
Michael Lasser,Steven Schmidt," And then a quick follow-up for Steve Schmidt. I think your guidance implies that the operating margin in the fourth quarter will be up to be 100, 150 basis points. A, is that appropriate? Is that correct? And B, what's driving that, and can we expect that to continue in the next year?"," Yes, what we stated was in Q4 versus Q3, that our operating profit would be up $10 million versus prior year. So that is continued growth. We mentioned that we see from our sequential basis, Q4 versus Q3, and while we still see the revenue down, it should continue to improve. And we are pleased with the progress that we're making from a bottom line standpoint. The focus really has been around creating effectiveness and efficiency across every area of the organization. We have streamlined our overall cost structure from a selling standpoint. We are continuing to focus around supply chain. Our mix of products and services particularly on the Direct business, continue to trend favorably. So obviously, our commitment, as I publicly stated, overtime, is to get these margins back into the mid-single digits. And we're making progress on that track."
Michael Lasser,Steven Schmidt,Is there anything unique about the fourth quarter that there'll be a disproportionate amount of benefit?,Nothing that I would want to call out.
Bradley Thomas,Neil Austrian," KeyBanc. Just one last follow-up on the CEO search. Will you be considering internal candidates, or is this external only?"," We're considering everybody. And obviously, internal candidates will always be included."
Bradley Thomas,Charles Brown," Charlies, I want to just follow up on some of the international trends. You obviously alluded to some of the changes in the political and economic backdrop over there, but can you just share more insight in terms of what you're seeing?"," Well, I think what we're seeing is a strong improvement in our contract business. I think we actually mentioned the fact that our U.K. business was up mid-single digits in the third quarter if we took out the public sector, and we're seeing those trends continue. So getting good growth in the regional accounts, getting good growth also in some of our strategic accounts. It's just that the a big portion of our business in our major markets, U.K., France, Germany, Netherlands, depends upon the government. And as you know also, the government is a bigger part of the economy in Europe than it is in North America, so it's kind of a double hit. Retail is looking very, very strong right now, of course. The French business has actually never been stronger from a Retail perspective, and we got good growth going in Sweden as well. So as I think Neil pointed out in his closing remarks, the issue that we have is really in the Direct business, where we have a lot more competitive pressure than we've had in the past. We have plans to address that. And you'll see those start to kick in, in the fourth quarter."
Bradley Thomas,Michael Newman," Just a quick follow up on the business solutions. In the first quarter that operating margin has increased year-over-year and in several years, obviously, the revenue backdrop is getting better. Do you think we're at that tipping point, where we should continue to see margins improve in the division, or do we really need to get sales back into positive territory?"," I prefer not to really give any guidance relative to future just because of the uncertainty around the economy. What I would say though is when you look at the first half of the year, we did invest. We had anticipated an economic turnaround. We invested in sales costs. We added additional resources. We invested behind marketing. We invested behind a number of areas. And at the end of the day, given the lack of an economic turnaround, obviously, that impacted our margins in the first half of the year. What we have done in the second half is really focused around cost reduction, mix, pricing and really driving the fundamentals of the business. And that's why you're seeing the improvement in the overall margins structure. Obviously, what happens from a competitive standpoint, what's happened from the economy are things that we can't predict. So obviously, again, my commitment, and we believe it's attainable, is to return this business to the mid-single-digit margin range overtime, and we'll obviously be committed to delivering that, but how fast and at what rate, yet to be determined."
Bradley Thomas,Michael Newman," Mike, can you give us an update on what you think for CapEx this year? And perhaps, an early sense for 2011?"," Yes, probably, the lower end of the previous range that we've given on CapEx, $170 million to $180 million. As we go forward, we're looking probably -- we've just finished our strategic plan. We're looking at CapEx probably consistent with DNA, in the $210 million to $220 million range. We talked earlier in the discussion about touching our old format stores. We want to take 400 old format stores and put them in the new M format. That will be a significant CapEx driver, going forward. And we're also looking at a common systems platform for Europe, going forward. So those will be two things that we're looking at that'll drive the business. And given where we are, with liquidity, cash flow -- I'm particularly pleased with the third quarter cash flow. That's probably the long and short of CapEx guidance from where we sit today."
