    'We expect to deal and face with inflation' is a 'Defensive answer' whereas 'We are prepared to take advantage of the inflation'
    is an 'Aggressive answer'. In this case you would define an 'Aggression' variable with this answer and any more if needed.
    A few other examples could be: Clarity (vague vs clear) and Optimism (Optimistic vs Non-optimistic).
    Don't include any justification for the labels. Generate your answer in the following format:
    'Here are 10 features based on the quality and tone of an answer:\n\n1. **Aggression:**
    The degree to which the answer is assertive or forceful.\n2. **Clarity:** The degree to which the answer is easy to understand.\n3.
    **Confidence:** The degree to which the answer is expressed with certainty.\n4. **Defensiveness:** The degree to which the answer is
    apologetic or evasive.\n5. **Optimism:** The degree to which the answer is hopeful or positive.\n6. **Passiveness:** The degree
    to which the answer is meek or submissive.\n7. **Politeness:** The degree to which the answer is respectful or
    considerate.\n8. **Relevance:** The degree to which the answer is related to the question.\n9. **Specificity:** The
    degree to which the answer is detailed and precise.\n10. **Tone:** The overall emotional quality of the answer.\n\nThese
    features can be used to assess the quality of an answer and to identify areas where the answer could be improved. For example,
    if an answer is unclear, the writer could be asked to provide more detail or to rephrase the answer in a clearer way.
    If an answer is defensive, the writer could be asked to be more assertive or to provide more evidence to support their claims.' Please note that the examples provided like Aggression, Clarity, Confidence, etc. are just examples and for you to understand how to produce the output.
