Charlie Erlich,Vivek Shah," Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I'm sort of asked a question about the fax business. First added the corporate fax segment to perform in the quarter and then also just from an industry point of view what percentage of the market would you say is cloud fax versus traditional hardware based fax and is the cloud fax portion of the industry growing at all and within that what do you think the market share or what do you think your market share is within the cloud fax business? Thanks."," So we have an interesting perspective into the share of the market that we have because we can see in faxing situations, are we on the other side. 95% of the time we're not. So that tells you that at best and it's maybe a little more than 95%, but at best we have 5% of the volume. Hard to tell you definitively how much of that volume is cloud versus server versus machine, putting server and machine together and just calling that analog. But our own channel checks and understanding of the market will tell you it's a vast, vast majority. Cloud probably is not more than 10 points if even of the overall market. So we see the real opportunity on the corporate side for us to be able to really change the behaviors of those customers on the analog side of the equation. In terms of the corporate business, we're continuing to see it grow. It's becoming a larger share of our fax business and is almost 40% of the fax of the revenue – of the total fax business –",,,,,,
Daniel Ives,Vivek Shah," I know. So let's come back on time. So look obvious you talked about on the M&A side, could you talk more also just organically what's happening on digital media in terms of some of the underlying drivers that are really giving you increased confidence going into the year or even on the subscription side of things?"," Yes, so we've got a few things coming on. So look, the display business is continuing to rebound, so our Q1 year-over-year growth and display between 6% to 7%, which is even better than what it was in Q4. So having that in the mix is really important and is part of kind of the momentum we're feelings. On the same time the subscription business probably on the media side going to be north of $175 million and so it's a significant growth engine for media. So across the board, we're pleased with what we're seeing. The quality of the portfolio is really improved with assets like Humble Bundle, we've talked about a fair amount. We've got a great asset in [indiscernible] and then also on the cloud side the VPN businesses that we've acquired are growth businesses. We really see lots of opportunities to that for it to grow organically as well as a space in which we can see a fair amount of acquisition. We acquired an incredible team. We're really excited for what they're going to bring to the company. So really it's kind of across the board we're feeling very good and then on the margin side, the margins are outstanding for the quarter and so, we feel good about that. Now to Scott's point we are looking to make some investments in some game titles in Q2 but that's the mode we are in. We are in the mode of putting capital towards M&A within the business to drive topline and to drive future outlook.",,,,,,
Daniel Ives,Vivek Shah," So that was actually going to be my question, the follow-up on the everyday health. I mean, is that could you obviously, you have a pretty good visibility there, three, six months ahead. So that continues to just step up?"," Yes, we're feeling very good about the everyday health business and in the components of it. I think, I mentioned this in the call the pipeline at the FDA is very robust, 59 new drugs got approved in 2018. But to Scott's point, we've got in [Dan Stone] an incredible leader to that division and he's put in place a fantastic team and he's now beginning to put in place some M&A and we've had the additions of prime which is a continuing medical education company and getting into the CME space is very important for pharma and pharma are the driver of this business and then we bought a great brand called Castle Connolly. You might know them, they do the top doctors. They do top hospitals and we love the whole rankings and ratings worlds as you know through a lot of the assets particularly on the tech and gaming side of the company. So, smaller asset, but we think a lot of potential. So we like the mix of the portfolio. We like the management team and the results have been very good.",,,,,,
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Vivek Shah," Regarding the dividend suspension and the firepower it gives you, how much capacity do you actually have for investments in M&A right now?"," So there's a couple different elements of that. There's obviously the cash we have on our balance, the cash we generate and the ability to take on additional leverage. So we maintain a fair amount of cash, but I'd say most of that that we have today post the acquisition of the assets from stack path would be working capital oriented. So there's some small amount there maybe 50 million - 75 million that would be available for future deployment depending upon the jurisdiction of a potential acquired asset because some of that money still remains overseas. In terms of leverage capabilities, we still remain moderately leveraged not even taking into account the raised guidance or the pro forma contribution from the M&A we've done this year and I think we can very easily within our structure move to three times debt to EBITDA even if you assume no contribution from either potential acquired assets. You don't give credit for the pro forma EBITDA acquired which means is another close to $500 million of borrowing capacity and then of course we have a free cash flow generation. We generated 104 million a free cash flow in Q1. I would say that with our raised guidance we're probably in the 360 range, 360 plus range for the year. We do intend to make some capital invest we talked about in Q4 which were very light in Q1 but will accelerate two through four. So we've got another 256 million to 260 million of free cash flow that we will generate over the course of the year. We will pay the last dividend this quarter that's about 22 million. So you should take that out of your calculations but if you add all that up you're around 750 million - 800 million without really stretching the balance sheet. Now clearly if demand warrants it, we could temporarily go more for three times leverage and take that up even beyond that 750 million - 800 million. So I think we're in very good shape right now, but the dividend the suspension of dividend does give us relief. Just to give you a sense of order of magnitude we have expended through the June payment coming up about 475 million on dividend payments since it was initiated in August 11, and clearly the circumstances are very different today than they were back then. Some of you will recall, some of you have covered us for that duration. We were essentially a digital fax company with close to 90% of our revenue digital fax and probably 95% of our EBITDA and we were in the very early stages of going into those other cloud services like backup what is now Martech and security and so we thought the dividend was a prudent thing to do to return capital to shareholders not knowing what the M&A landscape would be in those other areas to do two things, to preserve the existing shareholder base that we had built at the time but also to try to seek new investors ideally those seeking a yield. And somewhat ironically almost eight years later we have less than 2% probably closer to 1% of our shares that are actually held by funds that need a dividend for ownership. So the landscape has changed dramatically in that 8 year time frame. We've now got 14 businesses not one. We've got an evolution, the management structure and the demands for capital are quite robust.",,,,,,
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Vivek Shah,Is it a safe assumption to make that you wouldn't have to spend as a dividend if you were able to do what you wanted to do without debt or other financing?," I think if we had lesser demand, I would say this way we have lesser demands on our capital in other words if the dividend and our M&A were funded out of free cash flow we probably would have maintained the dividend, although there's an argument that from a pure capital allocation standpoint you've always got to have that discussion. But the reality has been in the last five years in three of those years we've had more M&A than the free cash flow we generated whether we pay the dividend or not. So in essence, you could argue we've been funding the dividend through borrowings which i think is not a good idea.",,,,,,
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Vivek Shah,Got it. Thanks for the color.," And I see those demands from the BUs use only increasing. I mean to be at a 270 spend rate in the first four months of the year and let's say that I'm right and we're in the 360 to 370 range of free cash flow, I'd only give you that hard this year to spend another $100 million.",,,,,,
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Vivek Shah," Got it and then just in terms of where you're seeing the most opportunity over your 14 BUs, can you give us a relative peak at that the size and timing of where you're going to see the most impact?"," Well, the great news is we got I think 10, actually there are 14 in some degree participating, but 10 that are very active. So it really is across the board. I think you've heard us talk about how to build the Martech business. Obviously iContact early in the year was a piece of that puzzle but that puzzle is far from complete. We've talked a lot about security. The privacy assets are key piece to that. We've got some interesting is going on in the healthcare space in each of our three business units there that could change in some cases even transform some of those business units. So it really is, I think probably the only one that is digesting right now would be the broadband business unit.",,,,,,
Nick Jones,Vivek Shah," Hi, thanks for taking my questions. This is the first one on visit and views, those came down a little but the revenue went up for the medium business. Can you walk through the dynamic that kind of created that situation?"," Yes, hi Nick. So the snapchat made a significant change in app's experience which caught publishers to see a huge drop in traffic, but it really had no effect on our revenues since Snap is less than I think one-half of 1% of our digital media revenues which makes it even smaller across all of j2. So adjusting for snap would be up. There's also been some changes in the source of traffic data we moved from Omniture in some instances to Google Analytics and that's showing some declines and that is hard for us to entirely reconcile and it doesn't split with actual ad impressions which is frankly the statistic that matters for display. So we're investigating that.",,,,,,
Nick Jones,Vivek Shah," Got it. It makes sense, thanks. And one quick follow-up on backup, we know it’s kind of managed decline. What's retrofitting to acquire their that's part of the manage decline so we expect to see more acquisitions in that vertical?"," Yes, look I think we're looking at some of these small tuck-ins that fit our ROI model. So remember we have been sort of on the sidelines in the backup space because valuations have been too high. We're beginning to see that shift at least for smaller assets. So we're going to continue to be opportunistic and then additionally we've made some investments in the business that we think will help drive retention of our existing customers. These are really high-value customers whose data continue to grow which drive revenue growths are just simply retaining customers has sort of interesting financial value. So we're doing those pieces, but we're not, look it continues to be in sort of this manage decline. We think we'll see some deceleration in that decline based on some of these small tuck-ins and investments in account management and infrastructure.",,,,,,
Rishi Jaluria,Vivek Shah," Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Let me start with some of the announcements around the VPN side of the business. I think to start off with, what do you see is the potential synergies with the other security offerings you have like the Viber or the other core email security side and one more follow-up on the VPN?"," Yes. It's a great question Rishi. Thank you. So we think privacy and security are essentially becoming the same thing. So adding VPN to our roster of assets in the space SugarSync and Viber to use two examples, we believe forms a nice foundation for a broader solution for consumers, small and medium businesses where we can solve all of their privacy and security needs in a suite. And so we are looking at ways of bundling. We're looking at ways of cross selling. We're looking at ways to attach multiple of these things to one another. We have interesting channels where in some of our backup businesses we have some channels that were not available to VPN. The same in our endpoint in Viber and so exploring the way to leverage these channels together was part of this thesis. So we see these things as working well together but also independently. So you've got customers who just want each one of these point solutions and we're not going to lose our focus there but we do see them as being highly synergistic. I'll also say that we do see some marketing opportunities on the digital media side given the nature of our audience and that we have many advertisers who are VPNs and so we can advertise our own product and you've seen us do that in other areas as part of what I mentioned in our my prepared remarks which is how do you leverage media access and how do you leverage inventory, marketing inventory to the benefit of your own products.",,,,,,
Rishi Jaluria,Vivek Shah," That's helpful and then just kind of following up on the VPN side of the business. Look if I go to your own property at PC Magazine, it seems like some of the leading motivators share for VPN usage and it's obviously some of us is going to be free versus paid but it looks like some of the leading motivators tend to be more entertainment or social media driven. How do you think about just your VPN offerings and the SMB angle versus the consumer angle?"," Yes so look I think there are multiple uses of VPN and there's VPN for security. There's VPN for privacy. And there's VPN for remote access and connect which is the classic VPN when we think in the business world of VPN. We think this asset is actually positioned to do all of it. So the Encrypt.me piece of it for instances VPNs for teens. This is a proposition that says look if you're a small medium business and you have your employees who are traveling the world and accessing the internet over unsecured Wi-Fi which they're doing they're doing it on the plane, they're doing at the airport and they're doing it the hotel we have a product that allows all of those endpoints to simply have our VPN on it to protect their connections and that is becoming an increasing use case. So that is a business argument. On the consumer side I do. I think there is there's enough of surveillance activity and I don't want them to know what I'm doing regardless of whether what I'm doing is whatever category that activity may fit in, the ability to make that private I think is also a driver. There is a part of the market that's looking to get access to content not in their territory that's certainly a part of the market. But I think the brands we've got kind of hit on each one of those and the reputation scores of these brands are very strong. There are a number of players in the VPN space. You really need to trust is the biggest piece that drives the success of a VPN brand and service and they earn very high trust marks.",,,,,,
Rishi Jaluria,Vivek Shah," Then last one from me and I will jump off but I wanted to maybe dive a little bit deeper into one of your more recent acquisitions which is Ekahau, maybe talk a little bit about some of the earlier traction you're seeing with that and since Ekahau kind of falls under the Ookla side if I'm not mistaken. Maybe talk a little bit about how you can bring together some of the core functionality of Ookla into what Ekahau does and maybe make it a stronger offering? Thanks."," Yes. So it's a great question. So Ekahau primarily works with businesses and workspaces to design deploy Wi-Fi within those space. So that can be office buildings, that can be hotels, that can be stadiums, that can be coffee shops, national chain because Wi-Fi is critical. We often say it’s like electricity for all businesses and when it goes down bad things happen. So having a solution that ensures the proper deployment and the proper management of those networks is super important. So I think just as a business on its own it's a great business to be in and it complements what is largely a consumer install base that we have on the Speedtest side. Where we start to get really excited is ways in which we can put Speedtest monitoring inside of Ekahau in the way we can put Ekahau inside of Speedtest. An example of that would be, how do you turn Speedtest into essentially an app that allows you to figure out how to set up your home network. That would be a very interesting use case leveraging Ekahau inside of Speedtest to allow Speedtest to be not just a tool that tests how your broadband is at home, how your Wi-Fi is at home but how to possibly place the router, how to configure the router, add repeaters etc. based on the configuration in your home. That would be a great use case, we drive usage for the Speedtest business. There multiple examples like that. I won't go through the list but you can start to see how what we do for consumers can apply to business and vice versa.",,,,,,
Shyam Patil,Vivek Shah," Just in terms of I know Vivek and Scott, you had talked about some of the reasons for the guidance raised. Could you just elaborate a little more on the specific drivers behind the guidance raised and how we should think about digital media versus cloud expectations for the year?"," Sure. Good morning, Shyam. So I think the first thing is we're screening some strong quarters together and you'll recall Q4 was a very healthy quarter. Q1 obviously we feel really great about. So we've got some momentum in the underlying businesses and assets and so while the original guidance above the midpoint did contemplate additional M&A in 2019. The time and size of the transactions that we've done thus far this year is kind of driving this increase in outlook. So we've acquired five assets this year for a total of $270 million. Four of those happened after our original guidance. So I'm not going to break out each in terms of contribution and price, but I can say that the VPN assets IPVanish, etc. the ones that we carved out from a company called [Stackpath] are the largest. In terms of guidance it's about 50/50 I would say in revenue between media and cloud.",,,,,,
Shyam Patil,Vivek Shah," Second question, just on the pipeline for M&A, how would you characterize just the size of deals, the types of deals and last quarter Vivek we talked about the carnage and the digital media industry overall and potential opportunities there, can you just talk about how that's looking for you guys as well?"," I'll take the second question first. Look I think there are a number of investable opportunities for us in the digital media space and we primarily look for companies that are display ad dependents that have not developed the multiple monetization layers that we've developed in verticals where we think that's possible. And so, we see a number of these and it is a big part of our pipeline. I think in general take a step back what is driving the pipeline are these 14 General Managers and so definitionally, the opportunities that we're seeing are bolt-on and tuck in within our different business unit. So I think it would denote a size and impact consistent with what you've seen from the company over the last couple of years. Having said that at the same time we're always looking at deals of all types of sizes and in the end if they meet our hurdle requirements, we'll be in a position to transact but the pipeline that we're looking at now for the most part are to the benefit of the 14 business units and ways in which they can accelerate their growth.",,,,,,
Shyam Patil,Vivek Shah,Great and it's my last question. Google talked yesterday about some changes that are coming to Chrome and third-party cookies just curious is to get your take on what kind of impact you expect to the ecosystem and to your digital media of business if any?," So, all the focus whether it's Google or other platforms on privacy really impact the larger ad platforms that rely on data to inform the placement of ads. For us little to none, I'd say of our display ad business relies on third party data. It's all placement based. In other words placing advertising next to contextually relevant content and when we use data to fine-tune targeting it's our own first party data. So I'm not going to go so far as to say that this will be a help to publishers like us. There's some in our industry say it will be but I certainly don't view it as a harm to us. I'll also point out that it sort of duck tailed nicely with our own thinking and move into the privacy business where we do believe consumers and businesses are demonstrating that they do care about privacy. And so a lot of what this is about social media tracking, surveillance, and privacy violations we think creates a real opportunity for providers of privacy solutions which is why we moved into the VPN space and affiliated privacy businesses on the cloud side.",,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,Vivek Shah," Hi this is Joanne for Pat. Thank you for taking my question and congrats again. Just on the competitive front, do you see anything changing specifically? Thank you."," Yes. I mean look, I think that the great thing is in all of our business we actually have competition which speaks to the quality of those businesses. It just I often say, we want to be in spaces where other smart people are trying to get a share of that market. And you even see it in our cloud fax arena there's competition trying to solve secure document transfer in industries like healthcare even financial services and legal is not without competition. We feel we've got good assets in each one of the market segments in which we operate. From that point of view there is competition to do. We feel good we have great assets to compete. In the M&A marketplace there's always competition. Now where we have an advantage is we have value creation opportunities or at least the deals we do have to have value creation opportunities that are unique to us that's by virtue of us owning the business we can create value in ways that others can't and that's how we're able to compete on deals.",,,,,,
