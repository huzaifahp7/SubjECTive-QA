Matt Sheerin,Gerald Paul," Yes, thank you. Just a couple of questions. Dr. Paul, do you have any sense of whether or not the book in trends here which obviously are weak to book-to-bill as weak as it’s spending a couple of years, is your sense that bookings are starting to bottom out here, and do you get a sense that revenues could bottom out here or could it take another quarter into the March quarter for this correction to play out?"," Well Matt, what we have seen is a kind of a turn around since the beginning of October so orders in absolute numbers come back and get stronger which also means something of course for book-to-bill ration. Really, September, my appreciation was a low point. Future will tell of course, but as we see a continued trend, still relatively weak order rates, but definitely better than they were in September. So which degree this will continue to be? Hard to say. But I think personally, that unless the world economy offers another surprise, the worst may be over.",,,,,,
Matt Sheerin,Gerald Paul," Okay. And in terms of the pricing environment, it looks like it’s starting to crack a little bit, but your gross margin guidance seems to be predicated mostly on volumes and even when we talk about pricing, is your sense that pricing will sort of be where it is now because orders are soft, and then perhaps more pricing pressure when volumes come back and when orders start to come back? Is that how you see it playing out?"," Matt, let me emphasize once more, it all relates only to our active business. I’ve said it before, on the past, except a few exceptions, we normally see and you will remember that very well constant prices, even in downturns. So because we are such a high share of specialty product. On the actives, clearly, the situation has normalized, and at the beginning of such a change, it overshoots a little. So I would expect that we already in the midst of very normal price decline. But we in the past were able to cope with it. So I am not – that we would be able to do it going forward. We also see of course by nature that some material cost come down, there is cost reduction effort, but as we – directly speaking, yes, we are – with normal development concerning prices in actives.",,,,,,
Matt Sheerin,Gerald Paul," Okay, and just lastly on your current production levels, I know you’re working to bring inventory down. So do you plan to bring production level s down in both businesses in Q4?"," We always adapt to the need. Vishay as you know is quite proud to be a relatively – I would say a very reliable supplier of free cash, the major element of that, is of course, not to let inventory to get out of hand. And we have demonstrated that in the past, we will adapt our levels. And honestly, we are relatively experienced than that, and this is what we do at the moment. But what I try to say before is – my ambition is, not to lose, strain, workforce, so we will use all other tools which we have like short working pass, so Euro like plant shutdowns, et cetera, just to adapt the volume of production, but not really inventory, in fact reducing inventory further, but not lose the workforce.",,,,,,
Joe Flaningvil,Gerald Paul," Hi good morning, it’s Joe Flanningvil [ph] on the line for Shawn Harrison. First question, I think you kind of alluded to, you said the MOSFET’s book-to-bill has improved here in October, can you get a little bit more specific in what kind of book-to-bills you saw throughout the month of October and by ..."," I want to be that precise, but you know, in the quarter, it was 0.5. Let me highlight it substantially better than that. But still not on the level we would like to see as you mentioned, but substantially better especially on the MOSFET.",,,,,,
Joe Flaningvil,Gerald Paul," Okay, and then maybe secondly here, you mentioned the automotive market holding about – there’s a lot of questions about global production slowing down a little bit here with issues in the supply chain. Are you seeing any incremental slowdown on the fourth quarter, or do you expect, you know, that to tapper off? It’s been an area of strength throughout the third quarter."," The moment we see – I’m talking mainly Europe I must admit but at the moment, people are really extremely optimistic in that. What we have seen in automotive maybe here and there, is some accumulation of inventories in the pipeline which needs a correction but this correction is underway but for my standpoint, the standpoint of this in production there is no slowdown as they say as they indicate as a longer trend or the mid-term trend so they are – they are continued to be confident on it.",,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul," Great. Thanks for taking time to answering questions. I don’t think your results and guidance are all that different from your comparable companies. So my question is more about what things look like as we come out of this? They look less cycle coming 2008 maybe a little bit different drivers but you had two quarters there where you grew 15 or I guess it’s 14% sequentially in 3Q and then 15% sequential the following quarter which does not necessarily square with your seasonality in those periods. So, as we come out of this, do you think the recovery would take place fairly dramatically like it did last time? Meaning is this is just mostly inventory correction but looking at distribution it seems like that could be the factor, and if it is going to be that dramatic, again, is it more related just to returning to in-demand versus any real seasonal impact probably?"," I maybe an old man but I have no crystal ball. Let me say the following, I suspect that this time it’s heavily inventory-driven this time. Last time we know what has happened but this time, it appears to be more likely that’s inventory-driven which means in deed as you said that there’s no inventory that last forever. That means there should be a recovery, a relatively quick recovery, relative if I’m right. But, you know, our politicians do the best currently to destabilize the world as we know.",,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul," Right. Actually on that point, since you are over there in Germany is just sort of chase your car on recent development with the steel and specifically stuff today and just feeling and the mood there in Germany."," Excuse me, sorry, I didn’t catch up with Germany, sorry.",,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul," Yes, just your feeling and the mood in Germany about the whole bank go up and how that would affect your business?"," Okay. Germany is not the most important part of the world but the economy continues very strong here as you know. I mean, all segments with – we are close to full employment for our situation. But, of course, there is concern there. You know the situations in Southern Europe and people get kind of angry in a way in my country at least, but this is not so specific for electronic. But overall, the industrial production in Germany runs high. But we know if the world does badly then German will not be an island, that’s also true.",,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul," Okay. Just – there’s been lots of questions going around about Thailand that there’s been some comments I think from it’s capacitor, tantalum capacitor players over there that’s got some exposure in tile industries if you could give us some color on how impact as you may – with what’s happening in Thailand.", I would not overestimate its impact but it’s to what you indicate. We do have some additional business because of the situation. And I think they’re not the only ones in the west that have additional business these days but I would not bill any forecast of any confidence on their product.,,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul," Okay. Last question was just with regard to gross margin, I think you indicated it will be down sequentially here mostly volume-related. Can you in some sense the magnitude with a couple hundred basis points to be unreasonable to think about?", Look our variable margin is between 45% and 47% so you see our sales bound and you can definitely calculate that.,,,,,,
Steve Smigie,Gerald Paul, Okay. Thank you., Thank you.,,,,,,
Jim Suva,Gerald Paul," Thank you very much. Can you give a little bit more details you’d mention about the cancellations in Asia? Are those primarily like on the consumer side, handset side, T.V. side and some of the end-market cancellations that you’re seeing?"," First of all, most of them come from distribution in our case which through a degree seem to be expected this because we knew all along that, of course, they had to hide the order rate before out of many reasons was high and we expected some correction. Anyway, and I think I said this before a few times. And so, it happened, but it happened immediately more abrupt seems to be typical for our industry more abrupt than we thought. And mainly it comes from distribution in our case but effectively this is indirectly consumer. This is consumer-driven I believe.",,,,,,
Jim Suva,Gerald Paul, And any end markets consumer through distribution that you’re seeing?," The computers relatively weak these days, relatively weak.",,,,,,
Jim Suva,Gerald Paul, Okay.," Hand phones, not the smartphones, regular phones are weak. I think this has much to do with overstocking everywhere but okay, in this case maybe the end sales has suffered already, the end market sales.",,,,,,
Jim Suva,Gerald Paul," And then my follow-up is, as we look at tantalum pricing typically if my memory is correct, it’s this time of year when the tantalum powder company start looking at contracting pricing for the future year out, is that the case now? And what type of pricing are we looking at for 2012 versus 2011? Because I believe 2011 was up pretty sharp versus 2010. What type of price of tantalum should we be considering for your cost of good sold increase and are you back in the market or you have to have quite a bit of inventory you’re still having – that you can go through?"," We did not believe in the shortages since a long time. We never believe the story with the shortage and therefore we don’t have so much inventory as well and this is not the environment for substantial price increases in tantalum powder, I would say.",,,,,,
Jim Suva,Gerald Paul, Thank you very much to you and your team., Thank you.,,,,,,
Shawn Harrison,Gerald Paul," Hi, good morning. Just a few brief follow-ups. Hopefully, I’m not re-asking these but the commentary at point of sale being down by 8% sequentially for the third quarter. With October coming back, are you seeing, I guess, that increase. Did it increase sequentially, the point of sale for the month of October?"," I have reliable information this case for a quarter, so I would rather not comment on a month on POS but obviously as quarters have come back to a degree, I would say the POS for sure will not have come down further, I think. It is what I would hope through from that.",,,,,,
Shawn Harrison,Gerald Paul," Okay and I guess within that comment, your view on the inventory that we will essentially pass, I guess the deepest part of this throughout, exiting the calendar year and we should be, I guess, close to parity as we come into 2012."," Maybe a little longer. Maybe this takes a little longer than that. It all depends, obviously, on the POS which is the adamant economy in a way but I would say, if you ask me, I think the quarter for sure as we also guide to, this triggers our guidance will be impacted by inventory reduction and distribution, I would suspect you will see something also feeling quarter one.",,,,,,
Shawn Harrison,Gerald Paul," Okay. And then I guess within the MOSFET business as well, you just briefly talked about continued or weakness within regular phones as well as notebook PCs. I know a big driver of that businesses, those two end markets. Does that, after we get through this inventory correction mean that you may not see a bounce back within that business just because the demand for those products isn’t as strong as it has been?"," Why not? I think as soon as things are normal then why should this not be or go back to normal? But what we count on is a better participation, the high voltage MOSFETs where Vishay historically hasn't been really and now we will have probably see a light at the end of the tunnel in a way, we see product which can compete with everybody. And we are going to start manufacturing them next year, beginning of next year, in large quantities. So I see, for MOSFET, should return to normal conditions. Why not? There’s no (inaudible) in that sense, end of this, either the implications nor of the product. But I see an additional change for us. Entering this high voltage market which we really haven’t been there, only a little.",,,,,,
Shawn Harrison,Gerald Paul," Very, very helpful and the final question, you guys did a very good job of controlling operating expenses this quarter. In case I missed it, where are they expected to go on a dollar basis for the fourth calendar quarter?"," They approximately where we are, maybe 191-192 something like that. Depends, of course, on the exchange rate also.",,,,,,
Shawn Harrison,Gerald Paul, Thanks so much., Thank you.,,,,,,
