Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson, Hi. Good morning Doug and Vince., Hi Ken.
Kenneth Herbert,Vincent Palazzolo," I just wanted to first ask on the third quarter on the gross margins, was there anything else besides the $400,000 you called out in unusual expenses associated with WMI that could have been a headwind in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense if there was anything else flowing through from legacy CPI or anything else from an execution standpoint we should be thinking about."," WMI's gross margin is still considerably below where we forecasted, not just the SG&A operating expenses of $400,000, but their gross margin is probably in the 400 basis points below where it should be. So that's really dragging the overall gross margin for the company below where it would be, and that flows all the way through the financial statements."
Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson," Okay. And obviously, the guidance reflects the sort of the outlook there, but what's the visibility of improvements here on the legacy on WMI business into 2020? And at what point does it maybe get closer to CPI gross margins?"," Well, I can address that, Ken. So this is Doug. The steps we've taken recently, in particular, the new system that we finally - we finally have their operating system and ours merged as one. They - as we executed on their contracts and particularly easier to do once they're under one roof with us, it was pretty clear that they had a lot of manual processes, a lot of excel spreadsheets, not a lot of forecasting, not a very good MRP system. And so the first step towards realizing the efficiencies that we've come to expect at the core CPI business, we feel we've taken the first step with the integration of those two systems.We are already seeing a little progress in that area. There's much more automation, there's much better working capital management and there's getting - the parts are getting out to the floor when they need to be there. So that's going to take probably this quarter and maybe into the first quarter of next year to start attaining the margins that we expect.And keep in mind, our expectation of WMI is not simply the CPI margins, we actually feel that we could achieve higher than our margins at WMI, and - but we need to get the manufacturing processes under control, and we think we've made the right step to do that."
Kenneth Herbert,Vincent Palazzolo," Okay. That's helpful, thanks Doug. And can you remind us what percent of the growth, the top-line growth in the quarter was WMI versus the other contract wins in organic growth?"," In the quarter, WMI was about $5 million in revenue. So CPI's revenue increased about more than 10%. Our revenue went up almost from 20 to - from - sorry, from $19 million to $20.5 million."
Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson," Okay. All right. That's great. And if I could, just two more quick clarifications. Did you comment, Doug, on when you expect to get word on the potential relief of the $3.6 million still outstanding under the working capital adjustments?"," Yes. We - the papers are all in with the court I think last week or so. I would expect that within the next, say, 30 to 45 days, the court will do something either ask for a hearing or potentially could rule on just the paperwork. But we don't think it's a year away. We think it's months away."
Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson," Okay. That's hopefully some good news coming there. And then just my final question is, you're obviously continuing to do a great job on providing better visibility on the top-line. I really appreciate the three-year outlook. You've announced a lot of contract awards and the pipeline seems very healthy. But Doug, I guess, just the fundamental question is, how can you help frame the opportunity on the margins from the new programs?And to what extent, as you're layering in additional business on to the facility, do we maybe see better incremental margins? Or to what extent can the incremental margins in the next couple of years move up based upon, obviously, the higher volume you've outlined?"," So all of this work, keep in mind, we won, it hasn't started. Some of them have started on the floor, but things like A-10, F-16V, some others that we intend to win, they haven't started producing the hours that the - the manufacturing hours out of the shop floor, which they will in 2020. There's a significant benefit to our fixed cost absorption when these starts being out on the floor, and we're actually applying a lot of direct labor hours to them. So you'll start seeing that naturally occur within the next, say, 6 to 9 months.Don't forget though, a lot of our growth is with some of these newer programs, and we do carry these lower programs at, say, lower than production rate volume margins. So the expectation is that the top-line continues to grow. Will there - will we be able to achieve full run rate gross margins in 2020? I think that's kind of sporty.Certainly, by 2021, not only is the top-line approaching kind of not peaking, but higher again still than 2020. And then you'll see a full year's worth of benefit of all of that absorption and better manufacturing efficiencies. And once we get WMI on track and executing on their more than $20 million in backlog at higher margins, I think the combination is a good story for mid-2020 and on."
Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson," That's helpful. And just, again, you're not - in terms of footprint and capital, you're largely set to support the higher volume. I mean, I can imagine there's some headcount and other things you need to add. But you're not looking at any major investments in terms of the capital, the footprint to support the volume, correct?", We are not.
Kenneth Herbert,Douglas McCrosson," Okay. Excellent. All right. Well, thank you very much."," Thank you, Ken."
Jeffrey Feinberg,Vincent Palazzolo, Thank you. Good morning., Hi Jeff.
Jeffrey Feinberg,Douglas McCrosson," Good morning. Can you guys please give some clarity in terms of the previous calls, I thought it was an excellent question in terms of where you think the pretax margin you have a lot of awards and strong contracts here. Can you help us understand at steady state, please, where the potential is in pretax margins?"," I'd really like to answer it this way, Jeff. The - when a year or two ago, we were probably in the, what would you say, 11%, 12% pretax margins. I would think that, that is reasonable for us to attain again. We were on track, and that was really kind of - on track to achieve that this year with the assumption that WMI's pretax income contribution would be up to a plan.So I think it's - if - that is something that we could reasonably attain in short order. Beyond that, the improvements to the gross margin that I mentioned before, a combination of not necessarily expanding our SG&A expenses, there's leverage there as we grow. So maybe a percentage or two higher than that in 2021."
Walter Morris,Vincent Palazzolo, Thank you.," Good morning, Walter."
Walter Morris,Douglas McCrosson," Hi gentlemen. My follow-up question is along the lines of one of the questions Ken asked. Can you - you said on the call that you should be on track with WMI heading into 2020. What does that mean as far as carryover impact of these issues you've dealt with in the second half of the year here with WMI? Will there be minimal negative impact in 2020 from these WMI issues? And if so, could you quantify that?"," Well, I can tell you that there won't be any negative issues. I mean, I guess, for clarity, the WMI is still - it was a profitable business, not as profitable as we would have planned, particularly on the gross margin line and then there was some kind of headwinds in the SG&A for the first year, largely related to the litigation.But - we envision 2020 being a very good year. Optimistically, we should be shooting in the, say, 20% gross margin range next year because - and probably because with the back end of 2020 being higher than that. But no, I think it's hard to say on a call the number of improvements that we've already made and will continue to make to make sure that the operations of WMI are run with the efficiency that we've - that we're known for.I mean, keep in mind, we are known in the industry as being good operators of manufacturing and good manufacturers. And we're employing all of our best practices on them. We have to - I think the - we overshot what we thought we would get and how quickly we would be able to come in and make the improvements that needed to be made. So that - I guess that was an error in optimism, but long term - and by long term, I mean, next 6 months, I think, we're going to see that operation turnaround."
Walter Morris,Douglas McCrosson," So again, to emphasize, what I thought I heard you say is there would be minimal impact on 2020 from these WMI issues and by early next year, you'll be operating at the efficiency and profitable levels you anticipated?"," Absolutely, Walter."
