Mark Spiegel,Mark Spiegel," Okay. I don’t know what have the operator kind of came in and cut me off there. The new products are sequentially flat from last quarter. So why is that? Kurt Busch Sure. So new products were flat, but quarter-over-quarter and reps are pretty encouraged by that, because we've seen a good amount of weakness in capital spending and most of those new products are in the enterprise space where that weakness of capital spending has been occurring. The weakness we see in specific is North America enterprise capital spending. And the fact that we’re able to achieve just, I’d say, flat new products quarter-on-quarter, I chop that up as a win, because we did see a pretty good decrease in the legacy enterprise businesses quarter-on-quarter."," So we’re now, I don’t know five years into this alleged economic recovery, which if you saw the GDP report this morning is really not much of recovery at all. What makes you think that enterprise capital spending is going to comeback if that hasn’t comeback by now? Kurt Busch So we’ve really seen the weakness just in the last two quarters Mark. And I don’t have good projection whether or not this is a two quarter weakness or one year weakness. I think probably some of the bigger enterprise data companies might have better visibility to us. But we basically are seeing weakness and push out. I haven’t really seen any deals cancel, but we have seen slowness; and getting the POs through and whether or not they happen in this quarter, the next quarter is still uncertain."
Mark Spiegel,Mark Spiegel," Last one, as I said one of the good things is that you’ve appeared to have generated around $200,000 in cash this quarter. Now you mentioned a letter of credit, I don’t know how that works into that, and can you talk a little bit about cash consumption going forward? Jeremy Whitaker Yeah, so just give you a little bit more flavor around the letter of credit is that we repurchase the raw materials from one of our contract manufacturer in connection with a transition to a new contract manufacturer. So we use the letter of credit to repurchase that material. That was about $600,000 and so that was not paid until April. So that had a positive impact this quarter and it will have a negative impact coming into the next quarter."," So you really consumed around $400,000 in cash, is what you’re saying? Jeremy Whitaker Yes, I mean that’s a good way to look at it."
Mark Spiegel,Mark Spiegel," And do you have any color on what that’s going to look like going forward, the cash consumption? Jeremy Whitaker Well right now we’re operating within a couple of $100,000 of breakeven and so if we continue to operate at a similar level I would not expect significant cash consumption. It should be similar to that."," So in another quarter you’re just reporting what is I mean, all those to be equal, essentially $400,000 of consumption you’re saying. When you say right now you’re within 200,000 [indiscernible] like, the quarter we’re in right now -- I mean that you’ve cut it by another 200,000? Jeremy Whitaker No, the quarter we've just reported down, had about $300,000 non-GAAP loss which is pretty close to our cash consumption."
Mark Spiegel,Mark Spiegel," So any color on your cutting expense I mean at this level of revenue, is that where that’s going to stay? Kurt Busch Right now Mark we’re working to grow revenue and control expenses as well as is working to improve margin. I mean as you saw we had a drop in margin this quarter. And all of those things will get us back to -- we’re working to get us back to cash breakeven, or get us back to the point where we were generating cash which we were doing in last fiscal year."," All right, I have no more questions."
