Jairam Nathan,James A. Donahue, Just a follow-up on your comment on shipping in the fourth quarter. Is there any particular segment of the market where you're seeing that delayed shipping? And is that typically normal with that product?," It really is just the customer's desired delivery dates, Jairam. It's nothing more than that. They often provide target dates. Not all of them want the products immediately."
Jairam Nathan,Jeffrey D. Jones," Okay, and as far -- now that your operating expenses are kind of starting to stabilize this acquisition, can you give us an idea of what your break-even level is?"," Jairam, the break-even levels at $65 million on a non-GAAP basis, $75 million on a GAAP basis."
Jairam Nathan,Jeffrey D. Jones," Okay, and the -- and then, you mentioned a little about the package inspection market. And can you give us an idea what the SAM for that market would be, and what kind of growth rate it's growing at?"," Sure. I think the package inspection market is sort of similar inside to any of our handlers segments. And it's not as large as pick and place, but not too dissimilar from gravity or turret. It's about $100 million market, complimentary to our current products. And ICs are electrically tested using any of our handlers"
Tony Grillo,James A. Donahue," I guess, my first question is, I was hoping you can talk a little bit about cross-selling opportunities that you saw in the quarter and hopefully going forward."," We are very pleased with the cross-selling opportunities since the Ismeca acquisition. In fact, going all the way back to their -- to the Rasco acquisition some years ago. During the second quarter, we were able to realize some benefits for our pick and place products. We're able to realize some benefits where Ismeca turret customers, both couple of OSATs that we were pursuing purchased MATRiX handlers. So we'll take those cross-selling synergies whichever way they come. Since the acquisition, we've seen -- until this quarter more opportunities where we're getting turret handlers into our pick and place or gravity handlers installed base. So this was a nice win, capitalizing on a couple of OSATs where Ismeca is the incumbent turret handler."
Tony Grillo,James A. Donahue," Perfect. And I guess my other question was, is the booking trend that you're seeing going into the third quarter, expecting to see more of that revenue or shipments in the fourth quarter? Is that kind of a trend you're expecting to see going forward? Or is that just simply based on this one customer kind of a onetime thing?"," By that, you mean where we're not going to necessarily ship within the next quarter everything we booked in the preceding quarter?"
Tony Grillo,James A. Donahue," Right. I know that's not always the case, but specifically you mentioned in the Semi business, it's a little more so, which is why you're guiding quite a tie [ph]. I'm just kind of wondering if that's the trend that you might expect to see going forward."," I don't really think there's anything kind of a trend, Tony. I just think it was the specific situation with a couple of customers and their plans to bring in equipment. I just -- I don't think there's anything more than that, not a trend."
Richard A. Ryan,James A. Donahue," Say, Jim, on the bookings front, you mentioned the strong T-Core bookings in the quarter. How should we look at that? Is that kind of a lumpy affair? Or is this kind of some new opportunities that we should expect going forward?"," I would say, yes, to both your questions, Dick. I mean, with the growth of mobility products like tablets and smartphones and the use of package-on-package technology where a memory device is stacked with an application processor, what we're seeing is a new requirement developing. The test of the final integrated package. The memory device itself and the microprocessor, the application processor are already tested. Those tests will continue. So this is a new opportunity, a new developing requirement, as opposed to eliminate infant [ph] mortalities and reduce warranty returns presumably on the consumer product from the field. So this is, I guess, a system-level test that's performed using specialized batch testing systems rather than traditional ATE. It does require precise control of the device temperature through the test process. And of course, we have significant proprietary thermal technology that's long been the benchmark for testing mid- and high-power microprocessors. And now that thermal technology is being used in these batch test systems. So we expect this is really a new opportunity, given that it's being used and integrated into a batch system process. We would expect this to be like OEM orders tend to be, somewhat lumpy. We receive a large order for x systems that are to be delivered over some period of time. It's not necessarily going to be a nice flat, even business."
Richard A. Ryan,James A. Donahue," Okay. And you talked about utilization rates, 80% or so since March. What -- in your conversations, what are your expectations going into the -- beginning further into the second half of the year for utilization rates?"," Well, we don't see, really, any great insight from customers that, that level is going to move dramatically one way or the other. It seems to be relatively stable as it has been from March. And if anything, it's moving very slowly slightly upward, I would say."
Richard A. Ryan,Jeffrey D. Jones," Okay. And Jeff, you mentioned OpEx in general. How do you see R&D? Can you break those out a little bit? How do you see R&D and SG&A trending?"," Yes, for the quarter for Q3, you see R&D around $11 million; SG&A, about $15 million, for the total of $26 million. Now recall that I've mentioned we've got about $600,000 of restructuring costs that are embedded in that SG&A number."
Tony Grillo,James A. Donahue," I just wanted to follow up with one more. I was wondering what kind of activity you saw throughout the quarter in LED, and kind of how you see this trending going forward to the next half of the year and into 2014?"," Well, we're seeing -- we had a pretty active quarter for LEDs. It was one of the main drivers in our turret business. And we see that being one of the stronger areas as we look at the various market segments we serve. So we're expecting that to be healthy the rest of the year."
