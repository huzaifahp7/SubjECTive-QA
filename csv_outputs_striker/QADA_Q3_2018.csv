Matthew Galinko,Karl Lopker," My first question is around just getting kind of your professional services hires upto speed and well utilized, is -- do you have any leverage you could pull to accelerate that process or is this just kind of the speed that will have to happen and can you just call it a little bit more about how you see getting to better utilization in the fourth quarter?"," Well, there is a lot of training involved for our large ERP package like we have. And when we hire people, we have a mix of people that we hire that are newbies, that are -- just graduated from college and a mix of people that pretty much hit the ground running that might have experienced with other ERP packages. Or we hire people maybe that have worked for QAD before so they can get going fairly rapidly but it does take time to train. In fact, the college hires takes us -- we have a 9-month program that they go through. So we do need to balance it with more experienced people and sub-contractors. But we've been doing reasonably well in meeting our customers' demands for the services which is probably the most important thing that we have going right now."
Bhavanmit Suri,Karl Lopker," I guess maybe just turning over first to license beats [ph]; that surprised me a little bit. Just -- as you're looking at the pipeline, just letting it a little color on sort of the mix there. Was that an existing set of customers? And when you look at the pipeline, is it still sort of 50-50 split and I know quarterly it changes but just some color on sort of how that's looking and how that might look going forward over the next year or so?"," Well, most of our licenses definitely come from existing customers who are expanding the use of our product, maybe going into factories and other parts of the world where they haven't been in. And we expect -- as the manufacturing economy is strong, we expect that to pretty much continue, although 60% of our funnel is cloud, so we expect to continue to have strong bookings on the cloud. Next year, as we look forward, we can't see anything that's necessarily going to slowdown the manufacturing economy. Having said that though, something happens at the stock market, that could definitely start affecting our customers' customers and then our customers; so we're always on the watch for that."
Bhavanmit Suri,Daniel Lender," Then one for Daniel, you know, the issue with the large cloud during the quarter, is that a one-off issue or you have -- could that happen again? Just a little more color on what exactly happened, that would be helpful. Thank you."," It's really -- it's a one-off issue with large deal that has certain contractual provisions in there that basically requires to have some environment slides before we get to start recognizing revenue, I mean those projects are ongoing and we expect to meet those milestones during Q4, so we're counting on that revenue for Q4. So Q4 will include a little bit of a catch-up relating to Q3 for that particular customer."
Bhavanmit Suri,Pamela Lopker," Got it. Pam, as you look at Channel Islands, I think Daniel mentioned more investments in Channel Islands, and I think we had talked maybe in the past about the R&D there sort of reaching a certain maturity level and some of those investments shifting to literally sales and marketing. Just A) some understanding what those investments are, the incremental ones? And then, B) again, not near-term but over the next 12 to 24 months, is that shift from R&D in Channel Islands and spend there, so maybe sales and marketing is still part of the plan?"," We have about another year and a half of intense development to [indiscernible] where we want to be on the complete platform. So I do think that we will have heavier R&D investments over the next period and half, but I do think that maybe before them, there will be more investments in sales area. But Daniel, you might have more of a forecast on that."
Bhavanmit Suri,Karl Lopker," One more last, any large SAP displacements in the quarter?", There were no specific large displacements. There were a number of the elsewhere SAP was in the mix but there wasn't anything to point to.
Unidentified Analyst,Karl Lopker," Karl, on your comment about the sales funnel being down; is that just truly a function of the size of deals per cloud being smaller than a license deal where the volume is either flat to up?"," The funnel being down a bit is due to two reasons; one is that we closed a lot of cloud deals in the quarter. Q3 maybe more than we have expected but also a year ago, we did not have a very strong Q3 so the funnel was larger a year ago just because of the weakness of the previous Q3; so I think there is -- those two factors involved made the sales funnel down a bit although we're not concerned about it because the activity is as higher than it was a year ago for sure."
Unidentified Analyst,Daniel Lender," And Daniel, maybe just some quick high levels thoughts if you can around subscription as we think about fiscal '19 and sort of the sustainability of 30% plus growth?"," At a high level, we're still are targeting to maintain growth at the 30% plus level. We are -- this quarter is the time where we have little bit of planning in terms of how we're going to achieve those but we are -- we feel that there is definitely room to continue that growth rate."
