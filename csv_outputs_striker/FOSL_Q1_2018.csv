Omar Saad,Kosta N. Kartsotis," Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Good progress on your plan. With wearables really starting to become a much more significant part of the mix, it sounds like you guys are much more confident on the trajectory in that category and your position in the category. Is that a fair characterization? And then as a follow-on to that, if you look at the current offering, the offering you've had over the holiday and you have now in the wearables, what are some of the opportunities to improve that offering? What are some of the feedback you're getting from consumers, what they like about it, what they don't like about it, and anything you can give us on that front from a product perspective, that would be helpful? Thank you."," Thanks, Omar. As you can see we're getting good traction on wearables overall. Our first quarter sell-throughs are pretty good. We seem to be getting somewhat of a viral impact where the more people wear them, the more they tell their friends about them. We're seeing pretty good sell-throughs on that. So, from our perspective, we've got some great new products coming the back half of the year. A lot of it is more health and wellness oriented, great new technology, new software, the product is getting better and better. So, we think we're in good position for that. In addition to that, our situation with traditional watches, we saw sequential improvement in sell-through during the first quarter that is kind of compelling to us. You also have noticed that the Swiss watch business is getting better. So, there could be some incidental activity going on and just the interest in overall watches. In our experience, when the upper end of a business gets good, we have a follow-on effect from that and watches just like any other cyclical business, it's not good until it is and we're putting a lot of innovation and differentiation into the marketplace as much as possible, telling new stories. So now we're in a position with both traditional watches, with ramping up our innovation and differentiation and also with wearables, we're bringing new products to market, our addressable market is actually much larger. Wearables last year was an $18 billion business, growing to $33 billion in three years. So, we're in a position with tool kit for both wearables and traditional watches, a great global distribution platform including our own distribution plus increasing e-comm and digital capabilities. In addition to that, we have CE (38"
Omar Saad,Jeffrey N. Boyer," That's great. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck.", Thank you.
Edward J. Yruma,Kosta N. Kartsotis," Hey, guys. Thanks so much. Just a follow-up on Omar's question. I know that you guys have dramatically changed the launch cadence this year. I guess when will we expect to see products that will ship for the third and fourth quarter? And in terms of thinking about your factory capacity and your ability to meet some of those demands, I guess relative to last year, how would you score kind of your factory availability or your ability to flex kind of close-in demand? Thanks."," Yeah, so timing, it will be about a month earlier than last year so think – see it in broad scale across our formats and channels in August with some early limited-edition launches a couple weeks earlier than that. Same sort of annual significant technology upgrade around that fall timeline is the key there. That should be on an ongoing basis be the cadence that you see. And then we'll be adding brands this year as well. So, you'll see more breadth of our offering to go along with that launch timing. In terms of capacity, we are, I think, going to be in a much better position this year even and better managing supply and demand and then at launch and then also have plenty of capacity to flex up and respond to demand in the back half of the year if we see an even better-than-expected result. So now that we're two to three years in on the supply-chain side, I think we'll just continue to do better."
Edward J. Yruma,Kosta N. Kartsotis," Great. And one follow-up, if I may. I know that the hybrid is clearly a competitive advantage for you guys but maybe a little tougher for the consumer to understand versus the display screen watch. I guess kind of what progress have you made in educating the consumer on hybrid and how should we think about that longer-term opportunity? Thanks."," Well, as we said before in our own environment, our own stores and e-comm, we continue to see hybrid's doing well and increasing as a percentage of the total. So, we know the product, consumers love it and we also see some viral impact"
Anna Andreeva,Kosta N. Kartsotis," Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon. Two quick ones. First on the SG&A, I think came in a little lower than your guidance. Any timing shifts we should be aware of? And what's driving I guess the big step-up in the second quarter? And as a follow-up, you mentioned off-price sales were a bit higher during the quarter versus plan. How should we think about off-price penetration as we go through the year? And should off-price channel be normalized when you guys think about sales stabilization in 2019? Thanks."," On the sales side first, on the off-price, it's still – off-price in terms of our total enterprise sales is under 10%. It had good growth in that channel overall for us, but it wasn't overly strong. I think you'll see that continue. It continues to be good liquidation channel for us, a good sales channel, so we continue to have that in 2018 from a plan standpoint. Probably a little too soon to say about 2019, haven't really gotten to what that plan looks like on 2019. From an SG&A perspective, we did have good performance in the first quarter on controlling cost, (44"
Anna Andreeva,Kosta N. Kartsotis, Many thanks. Best of luck., Thanks.
Irwin Bernard Boruchow Jr.,Jeffrey N. Boyer," Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. So, I'll focus on the wearable category as well. Jeff, in the back half of last year, I think you took some inventory reserves on some slow-moving inventory that I think you expected to sell earlier this fiscal year. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of the wearable revenue growth in Q1 was driven by liquidating this carryover inventory versus what the go-forward wearable category growth rate was? And then I think on the last call I think that you had talked about a 20% to 25% wearable growth rate for this year. Is that still the plan or is there any change to that outlook, or how should we think about the growth rate for the year?"," I'd tell you the growth rate, probably trending a little bit more towards the top-end of that range. We said 20% to 25% and we're probably about in the middle, but we're probably trending a little bit more towards the top-end of the range from a growth rate overall. From a liquidation standpoint, we are moving through that, let's say, in the first quarter. We didn't have a substantial amount. We were continuing to move through at a pretty good price point overall on it. We're really going to go through more of the liquidation phase as we get into the second quarter and really the third quarter is really our big liquidation. Think about our volume picks up significantly. We're trying to manage the margin realization on that product. We could have moved through more of it through some channels, we took the opportunity to move through it at a more modest pace as we went throughout the first quarter and so we'll continue to sell through it in the second and third quarter. So, I wouldn't say it's overly measurable number in Q1 that really drove the wearables number. That's really the underlying base business doing well."
Irwin Bernard Boruchow Jr.,Jeffrey N. Boyer, Okay. And you feel comfortable with the inventory? You don't think there's any more reserves that need to be taken on that inventory?," No, we feel very comfortable with the reserve we took last year."
Irwin Bernard Boruchow Jr.,Jeffrey N. Boyer," Got it. Thanks, Jeff."," Yeah. Thanks, Ike."
Dana Lauren Telsey,Kosta N. Kartsotis," Hi. Good evening. As you think about the wearables business and the margin on wearables and given that you're distinguishing whether it's the sports watch category, whichever type, is there a difference in the margin profile? And where do you expect the business to go in terms of percentage of sales on wearables?", I think we're on record of saying that we think the smartwatch display category at a sustainable level should be 45% plus gross margins. I don't think we've given guidance this year on where we're going to be. And then hybrid should be over time more like a traditional watch margin. So that's the way to think directionally where we're headed. We feel like we've got line of sight to that and I think are executing pretty well.
Dana Lauren Telsey,Kosta N. Kartsotis," And then on as you think about the percentage of the business becoming wearables over time, how do you see that?"," Well, we're going to find out. We're in position now with great capabilities for both the traditional and wearables. It's interesting that there's significant demand out there for wearables, business growing extremely quickly. It's an aspirational female customer, largely, which is our customer. They're very interested in the whole idea of connectivity and new innovation, so the potential's very significant. We have something like a 5% or 6% share globally of the watch business. If we get that of what's expected to be in wearables, a $33 billion business in three years, it could be a very significant business for us. So, we'll play it out. We'll see what happens. We're in a position where we're going to do as much as we can with innovation, design and execution on both traditional and wearables. We've got great new product ideas coming out and we'll follow the customer wherever they take us."
