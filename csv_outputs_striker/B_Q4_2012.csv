Asker,Responder,Question,Answer
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens, Where do I start? Can you shove anything else in that release?," Yes, we got a lot to talk about."
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik," Yes, I think there's a lot of happy people out there today. Well, I mean just the deal multiples alone, I'm assuming that it looks a lot like just because of the synergies that are anticipated between the 2 businesses because they seem higher than some of the other multiples in the industrial space."," I'll tell you that there's tremendous synergies from a variety of perspectives. And I think that when we looked at how many synergy -- how much there was with synergies with MSC compared to our own company, it just confirmed our overall strategy that we need to be a more closely aligned manufacturing service business. And I think that the folks at BDNA will really appreciate being associated with a pure distribution company. They think distribution, they have been very successful over the years. The sales folks will have a lot more to sell, their product line offering will expand, so I really think this is a win-win. And it's part of our transformational strategy. We are definitely doing what we said we would do, and I'm really pleased."
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik," Just if I could speak to the timing, it looks like there's $400 million after-tax, give or take, some changes. You said by end of first quarter, beginning of second, is that right?", Yes.
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Okay. And the proceeds, did you say half the proceeds will be used for debt and the other half will be used for stock repurchase? Just can you go over those numbers again for me?"," Sure, Ed. So immediately, obviously, when we get the proceeds, we will reduce our debt. And the expectation in terms of the use of those proceeds, we said up to up to half of those proceeds would roughly be used to buy back shares, and we would anticipate that to be roughly 4 million to 5 million shares in the year. And again, of course, that's subject to change. As you know, we're continuing to look at opportunities from an acquisition point of view, but that's our thought right now."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Okay. So just so I don't look back, you said half the proceeds, you mean $200 million will be placed towards the debt, the other $200 million will be going towards -- that's where I'm getting a little confused."," Yes, yes. So there's multiple -- clearly, there's multiple of uses. So if you start with the $400 million of after-tax, we're going to immediately reduce our debt levels, so that's one."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens, By what amount are you saying? Are you saying $400 million?," Roughly. Some cash will be outside the U.S. and our debt is sitting in the U.S, so a majority of which will be reducing our debt levels. We're going to take a look at -- we'll obviously take a look at the pension funding, as well as investments in the business. But the headline is, is we'll immediately reduce our debt, and about half the proceeds would be used to buy back shares."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," So let me just clarify what you're saying. You're basically saying $400 million worth of cash, give or take, will go immediately to debt, you'll refinance at some point and that will be used -- those refinancing will be used for pension or debt -- I mean your share buyback..."," Yes, I wouldn't call it refinancing. I think we were just -- we have a $750 million revolver that's out there. So when we take those, most of those proceeds and reduce U.S. debt."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," I got you. Okay. So on to the guidance, and you made a few comments about the MRO business in the fourth quarter. Did you actually give up -- give the number for the fourth quarter?", In terms of MRO in the fourth quarter?
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Yes, yes."," Yes. So quarter-over-quarter, we were down actually 13% in MRO. And on the Revenue Sharing Programs, we were down 21%. So net-net, our aftermarket had a tough quarter. But I did comment sequentially the good news is that we saw sequential growth in our spare parts, our Revenue Sharing Programs from third quarter to fourth quarter."
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik," Okay. So if I can kind of cut to the guidance and how the aftermarket and your thoughts for next year, you're saying you're being a little bit and you just said again, wait-and-see kind of approach, conservative approach. Obviously, some of them -- the industry dynamics, your customers like GE are a little bit more apt to be a little bit more bullish. I know we've heard the song and dance before..."," After a few times, you start to get gun shy."
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik," I get it. What is your expectation that you're building into the guidance for that business for 2013 bearing, I know you don't give individual segment guidance...", Right. We're looking at somewhat flattish.
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik," Flattish, okay. And so your customers saying up 10% -- 5% next year certainly means there's upside to that number?"," Potentially, but they have been wrong before."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Yes. Guidance looks like right in line with what we were looking for in the operating profit, but EPS was a bit shy. Was there something going on in a tax or interest to changes next year? I mean, you are paying down some debt and I understand that's not in the number there, but..."," Exactly. That's one caution and obviously, I wanted to give some color on guidance excluding the 2 announcements. But so given that, we wanted to at least profile out. I think the headwind of pension expense clearly was a drag on 2013 as we looked at that. But the rest of the business, that's how we're profiling out the year. And again, I would say just a little bit cautious on the aerospace aftermarket and outlook for 2013."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," But based on the revenue growth, based on the operating margin growth and if you kind of peel back the EPS assuming things are static from '12 to '13, it appears the number -- certainly the low end of the range is not even close. Is there something going on with the share count, the interest expense, the tax rate, something else that changes from '12 to '13 that we can kind of..."," Yes, share count for purpose of planning, again, prior to the transaction, we don't expect that to significantly change much. Clearly, you've got the headwind of an incremental interest expense that's factored in given the leverage, again, before transaction. And then tax rate-wise, we do anticipate that to be more in the mid 20% aside from this transaction."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens, Like stepping back to the 24% or so that you just...," Yes, so what we're kind of guiding in that number would be roughly mid-20s."
Edward Marshall,Gregory F. Milzcik, Right. But that should be related in the operating profit line?," Right, exactly [indiscernible] point."
Matt J. Summerville,Gregory F. Milzcik," Couple of questions. First on the transaction. Because I know your tax rates differed so much by jurisdiction, how much EPS accretion was there in 2012 from the business you're selling?"," Oh, that's a good question."
Matt J. Summerville,Christopher J. Stephens," Chris, is there any color you can give us then to button it up in terms of the EBITDA generated by the Distribution segment, and then we can make our own Raymond adjustment?"," Yes -- no, I'd say again that the SBU level, we were cautious to that. And as you mentioned and I'll comment again, this relates to the BDNA divestiture within our Distribution segment, and we'll take the Associated Spring Raymond business, the remaining part of our Distribution business and move that to the Industrial segment."
Matt J. Summerville,Christopher J. Stephens," As you think about Synventive for a moment, how much -- if you back out the onetime costs for the transaction and inventory step-up, how accretive was it to 2012 versus what you anticipated? And how much accretion, on an incremental basis, are you factoring in for '13?"," Yes. So Synventive. As you recall last quarter, we talked about this short-term purchase accounting adjustment. That ended up being an 8% impact to the full year -- I'm sorry, $0.08 to the full year. So when you think about that impact and then the overall business, we were down -- roughly, we guided that we will have no dilution. We were down about $0.01 to $0.02 for the year, actually, so it's a little bit higher on that onetime item. And then we're staying consistent with our contribution of Synventive to 2013 where we commented on $0.16 to $0.18."
Matt J. Summerville,Christopher J. Stephens, And then as you think about -- you mentioned the backlog in Aerospace early on in the call. How much -- it's about $550 million I think. How much of that you anticipate on shipping in '13?, Roughly 2/3 of that gets shipped out in 2013. Roughly 60%.
Matt J. Summerville,Gregory F. Milzcik," Okay. And then, I guess, would you say your OEM business at this point, excluding 787s, so your legacy platforms, would you say that you're seeing a business level out the door, so parts going out the door is commensurate to how many planes the OEs intend to build as they've raised their forecast?"," I would even include 787 in that. There's been no halt to 787 ramp-up at all. I know they have the issues with the battery and like, but there's they've been no impact that I've been able to ascertain, and that's the feedback we're getting from our customers as well. So we're seeing that there's a delay of 6 to 9 months or it's in advance to 6 to 9 months. In other words, it's 6 to 9 months from the time we ship a product before it gets out to the OEs, the final OE that is."
Matt J. Summerville,Gregory F. Milzcik," And then just one last one on the Industrial business. You talked about Europe being soft outside of nitrogen gas spring. I guess, we're almost 2 months into the year. Are you still seeing that strength in nitrogen gas carry over? And I guess from a cost structure standpoint, you've seen several quarters now of Europe not doing a whole lot outside of that business. What's your approach to the cost structure in Industrial for '13?"," Well, there's a couple of things. One is, we're still bullish on Nitrogen Gas Products as a whole. Long term, we have very good view on our Heinz Hanggi business because of the emergence of the gas direct injection technology. But also, there's some key points about the European auto specific PMI, which has been public for a little bit, and we're seeing increased order rates at our Seeger business. So I think stabilization and slight improvement would be the way I'd characterize Europe right now."
Peter Lisnic,Christopher J. Stephens," So first question, if I could just -- Chris, you talked a little bit about BDNA and the numbers there with Raymond, but the total segment's $350-some-odd million in revenue, you've quoted about $300 million in the press release, so is it safe to assume that Raymond's about $50 million business and can we make the assumption to around a corporate level EBITDA margin kind of business just as we're doing this math looking forward?"," Yes, I would say, first of all, again, we're cautioned to comment on SBU-related profitability. But you're right, Peter, when you think about the $50 million roughly for our Raymond business would be transferred into Industrial."
Peter Lisnic,Christopher J. Stephens," All right, that's fine. And then as you're looking at the growth rate for 2013, I'm just wondering if we could parse out Aero and Industrial, just color commentary, not specific numbers if you don't want to give specific numbers. But with the pending divestiture of BDNA just building a model x that I think is going to be important. So just kind of what's the color on, Aero -- Aero growth as you look to '13? Can you give us a little bit of color there? But -- and also the outlook for Industrial specifically would be helpful."," Yes -- no, no, no, very good. Good question. So on the Aerospace side, obviously, strong backlog, record backlog, right? Contributing a majority in terms of the OEM space. So we expect that to be double-digit growth clearly going into 2013. When you factor in the kind of, I would call, planned flattish level for aerospace aftermarket, we're being a little cautious there rightfully, so given 2012 in terms of how that played out. For Aerospace segment, we would expect low double-digit growth. On the Industrial piece, I'll actually -- let me comment on 2 pieces; one is without Synventive, and then one is kind of with Synventive, obviously, a lot of M&A contribution growth, inorganic growth, if you will, in that number. So without Synventive, we actually see, I would say, mid-single-digit type of growth globally, all right, within the Industrial segment and that would be the addition of our Raymond business to that segment. Clearly with Synventive, the revenues we anticipate are consistent with what we've communicated in the past than were close to 25% to 30% type of growth. So we -- I would say Industrial without Synventive, that mid-single digit and Aerospace being low double-digit is what we're anticipating for 2013."
Peter Lisnic,Gregory F. Milzcik," All right. That's perfect. And then just on -- you were very clear on the capital allocation side, but I'm wondering as you kind of go through some of these moves with the portfolio and integrating Synventive, what's the appetite for maybe adding onto the business, not necessarily via new stool or leg of the stool, but just what the appetite for acquisitions might be and maybe what the pipeline looks like?"," First of all, we have a large appetite for acquisitions especially now, but we're looking at several things. Our strategy of becoming more closely aligned, differentiated Aero Industrial business stands solid. And I might add, Patrick had a major hand, as well as Chris, in developing that strategy, so we expect that to continue going forward. Right now, we're looking at businesses or acquisitions that are aligned with the Synventive-orientated platform, as well as our Aero and industrial platforms to meet those criteria. So bolt-ons to existing businesses is the way I would identify those, not necessarily another leg of the stool, but building out a business that could potentially become another segment, such as Synventive's hot runner market may be one of the long-term goals."
Peter Lisnic,Patrick J. Dempsey," Okay. All right. And then that leads in my last question, which is, actually for Patrick, and if he can opine or talk about whether or not there's any changes in the strategy. It sounds like not just given your answer there, Greg, but I'm just wondering as that transition occurs, should we think about any sort of adjustments to the operating model as we look forward?"," Thank you and -- thank you for the question. So first, I might just say that I'm very excited to become the CEO of Barnes Group and for the opportunity to lead the company forward. I'd also like to just express my gratitude to the confidence that the board has expressed in me, as well as Greg, to lead us forward. What I would highlight is that one of the great benefits of being selected as an internal candidate by the Barnes Group Board of Directors through our internal succession planning process is the fact that, as Greg just mentioned, as a member of the senior leadership team, I've played an integral role in the development of our current corporate strategy. And as such, I'm fully committed to it along with the rest of our senior leadership team to its successful execution, so we're excited to continue to accelerate our strategy forward. And today's announcement is a significant -- with regards to BDNA, is just one more significant milestone on that path forward."
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens," So I just want to make sure, earlier, Chris, you indicated that the aftermarket and OE numbers, well, you said quarter-over-quarter, you mean year-over-year, right?", So let me -- are you talking about 2012?
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens, Fourth quarter...," Yes, so fourth quarter, let me give some color on fourth quarter. So OEM quarter-over-quarter was up 10%. Aftermarket was down for an overall Aerospace for the quarter was up 2%. And then, Scott, just to elaborate from a full year point of view, we saw 5% OEM growth year-over-year, down on the aftermarket side with an overall Aerospace of 2% growth."
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens," The second part of what you just said is a full year number, or..."," Yes, full year number. Year-over-year is 2%, quarter-over-quarter was also 2%."
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens, Okay. What I'm trying to understand is your definition of quarter-over-quarter. You mean sequential?," No, that would be fourth quarter last year..."
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens," Okay, so that's year-over-year?"," Year-over-year, yes."
R. Scott Graham,Christopher J. Stephens, Fine. Okay. Next question is could you tell us the Synventive contribution to operating income dollars?," No. Not to be blunt about it. We were cautioned about disclosing profitably at the SBU level. But I could say that aside from my earlier answer to the question when it was brought up, we saw a slight dilution to the year. But again, the performance of the business as we carried into 2013, we anticipate that to deliver $0.16 to $0.18 of EPS to the year. So again, just echoing Greg's comments, we're very pleased with the acquisition. It's going very well and we're progressing."
R. Scott Graham,Gregory F. Milzcik," Well, Greg, now I'm going to come at you a little bit here. So we have a great job done by you guys selling Barnes Distribution Europe, then you fixed up Barnes Distribution North America and you sell that at what looks to be a pretty good price. You've got the largest OE backlog or Aerospace backlog, you've ever had. You just completed a partially transforming acquisitions from Synventive, and you've got now a bunch of proceeds to continue to upgrade the portfolio. You're a young guy and you're retiring.", That sounds perfect.
R. Scott Graham,Gregory F. Milzcik, Help me understand why you would retire right now.," Well, first of all, I'm really pleased -- I always say that though, if you leave the place in better shape than when you found it, you did a good job, and that's very satisfying to me. But I'm well into my seventh year at CEO, and I think it's healthy for the company, as well as for me, for a change. And don't forget, late '08 and '09 are like dog years, so it's equivalent to 17 years if you..."
R. Scott Graham,Gregory F. Milzcik, For all of us.," Yes, I won't relive that. But I never truly intended to make -- being a CEO a lifetime career and I intend to continue working for the rest of my life, so when I say retire, that's just retiring from this particular position, but I will continue to make endeavors long-term. I intend in the short term to work with individuals and organizations helping to shape public policy in manufacturing in America, which I think is thoroughly needed. So that's why intend to do short-term."
R. Scott Graham,Patrick J. Dempsey," Well, okay. I thought we'll get a little from you, but that's okay. I get that. Patrick, on to you, just given what I laid out there, you now have this grand opportunity to continue to move -- trade the portfolio up into higher-margin businesses. Could you give us an idea of what's you're looking at? Do you think is it more on the Industrial side? More on the Aerospace? The balance of the 2, a third leg? What is your view here?"," Yes, from my perspective, I think the focus will continue on the Aerospace and the Industrial segments more so than thinking about it as a third leg. As we continue to execute our strategy, we'll look to transform into more differentiated intellectual property-based products, processes and systems. And so I think we are actively continuing to fill the pipeline and are very aggressive in terms of our continued focus on identifying potential targets, and excited to continue to leverage the most recent transaction into future growth and the balance sheet will be in great shape for us to make our next strategic move."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," I'm assuming you're not going to give guidance x the sale of the business today, is that right?"," That's right, Ed."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Makes sense. Is there any way you can kind of look at the position on your debt assuming the $400 million proceeds are paid off on debt, and what that interest expense for the year might look like, or at least the rate of interest that might look like, assuming you pay down certain tranches of debt that you like to?"," Yes -- no, understood. I'd rather wait for the first quarter. It's not I'm kind of trying to not to answer the question, it's just that we'll have a lot of moving parts, one, being the timing of that cash, thinking about the deployment, thinking about timing of share buyback. There will be many factors. I'd rather caution until the first quarter and then provide as much color as I can then."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Sure. Right. Out of curiosity, your guidance of $2.03, $2.19 and the other ranges as well, does that include -- is that GAAP? Are you including anything from Synventive, and I think you kind of alluded to that earlier in the call?"," Yes -- no -- yes, it's including Synventive in those numbers, so it's..."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," Well, not just the acquisition of Synventive, but any inventory accounting, anything else like that?"," Yes, yes, it's a full-up number, exactly. It's not on adjusted basis. Let's say, $2.03 to $2.18 would be on a GAAP basis."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens," What would -- what is the assumption for, say, onetime charges or accounting charges that is going with Synventive?"," Yes, there were just -- the short-term purchase accounting that we discussed with the 2012 issue given the inventory turns, so it's really behind us. As we go forward, it's more recurring in nature in terms of the purchase accounting impact."
Edward Marshall,Christopher J. Stephens, Okay. So the GAAP number is just as close to the adjusted number at this point anyway?," Right, right. Exactly."
