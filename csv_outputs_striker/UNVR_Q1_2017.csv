Ryan Berney,David Jukes," Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. And congratulations, David, I wanted to say that upfront.", Thank you.
Ryan Berney,Steve Newlin," Now you've been in place, Steve, for about a year. Curious as to your thoughts on maybe what's been the biggest surprise as far as headwinds go for you convincing some of your suppliers to open up more of their portfolio to the third-party distributor market, maybe as a market, and then maybe to you specifically."," So Ryan, that's a great question. I mean, I think that the challenges that we face with our suppliers, and it's clearly getting a lot better. I mean, David has known these folks at the top levels, I know them. There's been trust that's been developed over years that predate the last year, here at Univar. And having worked with him in the past and seeing how we do things, they're really opening up their eyes and the opportunities for us. The biggest challenge, to kind of answer your question -- so that's just a little color around it, but to answer your question, the biggest challenge we've had is just -- they want us to have the right kind of marketplace behaviors, they want us to go get new business and grow, and hang on to the business that we have. And they also don't want to see antagonistic relationships, where we have multiple suppliers of the same product that have to compete through our channel. So we're working on all of those things at a really brisk pace. I think the biggest thing that we can do for our supplier partners is to execute better in our sales force. And that's the drum that I've been pounding since I took this job day-one. We're getting better, but there's a lot of work to do yet. This is a culture change. It involves changing how you reward people, how you recognize people, who you hire, how you train them, how you motivate them. And that's the biggest challenge that we have. And I will tell you that we're seeing very good successes in Europe, and in Canada, and we're seeing tremendous progress in the U.S., but trust like that takes time to develop, and we're nurturing the relationship, we're getting new shots at things. And I would expect this to continue, in fact, accelerate."
Ryan Berney,Carl Lukach," Great, thanks. And then Carl, could you just give us your latest thoughts on where you think the right leverage target is, and maybe where you see that trending over the next year or two?"," Sure, Ryan. Our comfort -- I call it comfort versus target, is at three-and-a-half; we think that the stability of the cash flow that we have can support that much leverage. An ideal capital structure would be in that area. We're at 4.8 at the end of this [technical difficulty], but over the next year, year-and-a-half, I see that coming down, I'd say, on its way to 4 over that 18-month period that you mentioned. I think that's a reasonable expectation."
Allison Poliniak,Steve Newlin," Hi guys, good morning.", Good morning.
Allison Poliniak,Steve Newlin," I wanted to touch on the volume decline in the U.S., I know you attributed some of it to your actions specifically, but then also a little bit of sluggish market. Could you help us quantify your [indiscernible] was it mainly your actions that led to the volume decline, was it markets still, and what kind of visibility do you have for the balance of the year?"," So Allison, it's Steve. I want to just give a little bit of -- I want to put this in context here, and then I'd like David and Carl to weigh in on it. And if you follow, I guess, my past practices, its volume is not the driver of profitability growth. And we're trying hard in our culture to be more selective about the customers we choose, to work on the mix of our product so that we have the appropriate amount of higher margin products in there. And in fact inside the tent here, I don't like us talking a lot about volume. Now, I know in your space you have to do that. And will come a time where you can really measure us on that front, but it took me a long time to get that changed in the last house. And we're moving a little faster here. So it doesn't bother me at all where our volume is. In fact, if our volume grows too much without a massive amount of leverage on the profitability line it makes me a little bit nervous because I don't want us spending our time on business that doesn't make a lot of sense for us. So that's the context. And with that, David, do you want to go first, then Carl?"
Allison Poliniak,Carl Lukach," Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, I just want to clarify. The improvement in the outlook on adjusted EBITDA growth, it sounds like that's mainly your actions. Was there any underlying improvement or expectation in just the general market, or is this all you at this point?"," I think this is self-help more than anything else. We're not changing our view on the market outlook. I think that the executional activities and improvements that we've been driving hard are coming in, and we're going to expect them to continue to come in at a faster pace. So no changes in how we view the exogenous matters."
Allison Poliniak,Carl Lukach, Perfect. Thanks guys., Thank you.
Andrew Buscaglia,Steve Newlin," Hi guys, congrats on a good quarter.", Thanks Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia,Steve Newlin," So, I just have one thing, not to nitpick, but on your free cash flow. So it was negative this quarter. Can you just walk through what happened there? I mean I know seasonally it's probably lower and you're going to ramp this year. But just trying to parse that out in terms of how that relates to with your M&A, if you have enough cash on hand and I think…"," Sure, Andrew, thanks for that. I'd say that, to answer your last question first, yes, ample liquidity and cash on hand to more than enough to execute our acquisition strategy. In terms of the net working capital change in the first quarter, two parts to that story. Yes, as you said, the seasonal uplift which happens every year in the first quarter, sales happened in the second and third quarter, that is always amplified up in Canada with our Ag business. That's in the mix there too. But then again, in the cash flow statement you'll see that last year's first quarter we had a very large harvesting of working capital. A large portion of that was the decline of the oil and gas business at that time, kind of the peak of the decline. So tough comp, I'd say, when you look at the year-on-year cash flow of the company, and by saying that our full-year outlook of net working capital change in the $50 million to $100 million is still quite a safe bet. We, as you know, have outflow in the first, and inflow at the end of the year."
Andrew Buscaglia,Steve Newlin," Okay, yes. No, I think I just phrased that wrong in terms of that, my M&A comment. But can you talk about M&A as it pertains to are you having discussions right now with companies? What's the activity like out there?"," Yes. So we are having discussions all the time. Obviously we won't talk specifics. I'm disappointed that we haven't landed a few smaller acquisitions. We're working on them. We've got a pretty good funnel or pyramid, if you will, of opportunities. We're in active conversations. I think the difference is we're going to remain disciplined. We don't want to overpay for things that -- it's pretty easy to determine the value of these enterprises. And you have to understand the motives of the sellers, and so on and so fort. So we're taking a rather disciplined approach. You might call it conservative, and I'm okay with that. But I will tell you that I'm disappointed we haven't landed anything of late. And we're working hard to do just that. My hope is that by the time we talk again, a quarter from now, we'll have some news. But you just can't predict this. You don't want to get overly excited about opportunities that cause you to behave in a way that you may regret someday. So, I'm sort of mixed with our process. I'm happy with our discipline, but I wish we had more flow. And you'll see us accelerate this before the year is out."
Andrew Buscaglia,Steve Newlin," All right. Well, thanks guys.", Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst,Steve Newlin," Hi, this is Dennis [indiscernible] for Laurence. How are you guys doing?", Good. How are you?
Unidentified Analyst,Steve Newlin," Good. To improve relations with your suppliers, are you looking to be going to like more self-sourcing for your larger product?"," So, I think the person that has done the most over the years to improve relations with suppliers, and we certainly have seen it happen in Europe, and it's happening here in the U.S. now, and he'll have a global role to do it, is David. So I'm going to let David Jukes answer that question."
Unidentified Analyst,David Jukes," Okay, thank you for that. And then you mentioned moving more business in this, so I guess in smaller or –- or in just hitting more singles, I guess. Is there a certain regional end market where you want to focus and you think it's more achievable or just better to look at?"," So I think that if you look at our business, we broke our business down into four lines of businesses, services, bulk, local chemical distribution, and focused industries. There's growth opportunities in all of those, but the sales cycles in all of those are very different. So you would expect to see some share gain more quickly in local chemical distribution than you would in focused industries, where the sales cycle will be much longer. But we see opportunity right across all our business. And the bits we didn't see opportunity, and we're doing much less of, that's the whole point of our focus."
Karen Lau,Steve Newlin," Thank you, good morning everyone. I was wondering if you're already seeing some market share gain among suppliers. Are you realizing maybe more new authorization on product sales or are we still working on for now on the pruning phase, and maybe just sell more big products?"," So, we are getting some new authorizations. And we're getting those in various parts of the world. This is something David's been working very hard on. In order to do that, it goes beyond just the simple trusting relationship that you have; you've got to show them some data. You've got to show them that you're able to grow your business again, and that you can grow their business for them. And that's why it's so important that we focus on new business wins out there, and change the mindset of our sales force. This is what David is working -- we're all working really hard on, to get people to have better skill sets, to be more effective and more efficient in the execution of their sales call, to increase the amount of new business that we gain. This turning point for the first time in eight quarters of having growth in the U.S., those are the kinds of things that help us get more authorizations from our existing suppliers as well as those that we're pursing that we don't have relationships with. David, you want to add anything to that?"
Karen Lau,Carl Lukach," Okay, great. So it sounds like there's more happening overseas, but U.S. is still very early in the process and more on to come, okay. Could you give us an update on the sales force churn since you started the new comp structure and implemented the realignment in February? And how does it compare versus historical?"," Well, historically we've had pretty high turnover in our sales force, too high. I know the prior two years we had 22% - 23% turnover. That's entirely too high. Generally where we want this to land is probably around 10% - 12%. You are always going to some -- you have some people that voluntarily leave. You are going to have some that just don't make it. So, it's been too high. Some of the actions we have taken are really exciting and motivating to those who like to get rewarded and are competitive and have the goal orientation and the drive to succeed because we're going to rewarding and recognizing them more. Some of those who don't have the skill set, the versatility, the adaptability to call outside the boundaries of just procurement and call through the organization and sell our value prop versus just sell our chemical, they are struggling. And so, there's turnover in those ranks on both ends whether it's our choice or theirs. So, specifics, David, I will leave that for you to discuss."
Unidentified Analyst,Steve Newlin," Good morning and thanks for taking two questions. The first one is on the U.S. volumes that you actually intend to keep, so not what you are trying to de-market, but the volumes that you actually like. Could you talk about what you are seeing there in terms of demands? You seem to talk about softness, so I am just wondering where you're seeing the softness. And the second question is on guidance sequence. I guess you are going to face tougher comps in Canada and in Europe in the second half. And that's exactly when you are trying -- when you are intending to accelerate. Can you talk about whether this will -- this should come from I guess acceleration in Canada and in Europe? Or, is it just the U.S. business seeing traction from the turnaround and accelerating extremely fast between the first half and the second half? Thank you."," So I think the reason that we're more bullish on the second half clearly it has to do with the skill set, the new people that we're hiring. And we still have a lot of positions in the U.S. for sellers. And we are picky about who we hire. Very particularly about who we hire. So it takes little more time to attract, train, develop, and then get them in the game and have them go through the sales cycle and grab the business. So that work is ongoing. But we see time on our side to make it better, faster, stronger. And I think that's the reason for the delta and the uptick we expect later in the year. If you just kind of look at our progression all I mean the fourth quarter, we saw some turning. The first quarter, we are seeing turning in the U.S. while we've maintained the growth outside the U.S. And it's absolutely true the comps for the second half were stronger but our organization is stronger. And we had more time to implement and execute on the goals that we've established."
Unidentified Analyst,Carl Lukach," Hi, good morning. This is Ben on for Steve. In Canada, can you discuss the shift in mix that occurred in the quarter and what your outlook is for margins going forward in that segment?"," Okay. Hey, Ben, sure. Yes, there is a very visible shift going on. We had a nice rebound in the energy markets in Western Canada for that that brings to life a lot more demand for methanol and to the natural gas pipeline. And that is compared to the average, it's a lower margin product. So you see the shift in margin there. We also saw demand up in the mining sector in Canada in the first quarter. But we also have more initiatives for growth in place in Eastern of Canada and industrial end markets of Eastern Canada. So it's always to tell those three, and then you've got Ag in the middle of the country that is coming up pretty nicely this year. So our end margin is the result of those three distinct end market zones within Canada."
Kevin McCarthy,Carl Lukach," Yes, good morning. Thank you. Between November and February we saw quiet sharp inflation among lot of commodity petrochemicals; methanol, butadiene, propylene, styrene et cetera. Call it 30% to 100% in some cases. Can you talk about how you managed through that volatility? And whether or not it has any appreciable impact on your financials in terms of volume or profitability?"," So I mean we are constantly assessing the cost increases or decreases that we have and making sure that we don't get trapped in situations where we have a big down graft in pricing with a lot of inventory on hand. And like when it goes the other way, when inventory does revalue because of price increases and we work with our customers on what share of that we are willing to share with them. But we're on top of prices, of products all the time. We did see methanol, sodium hydroxide solution, xylene, some of these products went up. And we saw hydrochloric acid dropped about 16% in the quarter versus prior year. So, I would say all in, it's a little more up than down. We like that. We like dynamics in the marketplace because we think we're decent at and getting much better at adjusting our pricing appropriately to get our fair share."
Kevin McCarthy,Carl Lukach," That's helpful. And then second one if I may, Steve, on Slide 4, you call it 120 basis points of improvement in your conversion ratio. How focused are you on that, do you manage to it, and how high can it go, maybe a little context here will be helpful?"," Hi, Kevin. It's Carl. As a distributor, conversion ratio is a metric that we look at monthly if not more frequently. And how much of the gross profits are pulled out to EBITDA. And 32-ish% is I would say okay, but we should -- and it moves around quarter by quarter. But on an annual basis, we see ourselves creeping up to 34%, 35%, 36%. If you look at industrial distributors, you will see those kinds of conversion ratios as pretty much at the mean. The only thing I'll add to that is the added benefit of e-commerce and digitization that we're brining into our portfolio as we reduce backroom [ph] cost and cost of transaction, and that can help elevate that conversion ratio even higher, but that's yet -- like a prediction on that yet, but that's another dynamic in the equation."
Jim Sheehan,Carl Lukach," Thanks. And in EMEA, can you talk about the mix improvement you got there particularly with pharmaceuticals? And how sustainable that might be going forward in 2017/ I think you called out that some of the improvement you saw in EMEA is due to extra billing days and some of this mix is not going to be sustainable through the rest of the year. How should we do that in the second quarter?"," Good question, Jim. It's Carl. The improvement in EBITDA in the quarter was -- about half attributable to our pharmaceutical finished goods business that is more rightfully looked at it as an easy comp. Last year's first quarter was abnormally low in sales based on the selling patterns in that market. And so, we got to boost and amplify it to the growth in the quarter. Excluding that end market, we had 13% growth in the quarter in EBITDA. So I think that you are right. Going into the second, we won't get that kind of growth in the second quarter because of that easy comp in pharma, but we do hope to continue to execute against our restructured business there in Europe and continue the growth going."
Jim Sheehan,Steve Newlin," Great. And then on the pricing environment you are seeing, we had kind of a tailwind in chemical price inflation in the first quarter. And some of your end markets, you are probably still seeing some increase; I think caustic soda is still on the rise. But then maybe some other areas with more petrochemical chains, some of those have started to roll over, where do you see pricing in the second quarter developing for you guys?"," I mean on that, your guess is probably as good as ours if you are into this space. We roll with -- we take the punches and roll with them. We try to stay ahead of them and make sure that whichever way they go, it's positive for us. We like them going up more than we like them going down. But we manage through both. And like I said earlier what we like are dynamics rather than steady state. So we're not -- we don't worry about that. We just adapt to it. And we adapt very quickly. And I think I can tell you that we are far more nimble today than we were about a year ago. With that, I think we are ready to close out. I want to thank you all for joining us today and also remind you that we do have Investor Day on the 15th of May in New York. Hope we get a chance to see you there. We are going to talk a little bit more about long term and talk about some of the important goals that we have to drive value creation. Thank you very much."
