Camille Gaduaralla,Peter Swinburn,"Hi, thank you. Could you give us a little more detail on the Vancouver Brewery, how your progress is, and when you expect it to be 100% up and running. Then, what type of savings can we see coming out of that?"," It’s up and running now. We’re running the line in and the line is fully installed, and the savings are primarily going to be in the area - in the short term, at least - of reduced transportation from our Toronto Brewery. So you should begin seeing that very soon."
Camille Gaduaralla,Peter Swinburn,"So you’ve got about a 2% minimal cost in the third quarter, but that’s something that we probably shouldn’t worry about right?"," Two percent. You may see a little bit of it in the fourth quarter, and not all of that is directly attributable to Vancouver, because obviously fuel has gone up, but you will see some reduction, yes."
Judy Hong,Kevin Boyce," Thank you. Kevin, I’m hoping to get a bit more color in terms of your cost profit performance in Canada in the quarter. If you can quantify how much of the decline was really won off the items versus the heightened level of discounting that you’ve mentioned? And can you just talk about what’s really driving the higher discounting activity in the third quarter and it sounds like you talked about the fourth quarter trends being a bit of a moderation from a discounting activity perspective. So if you could just go through that in more details I’d appreciate it."," OK, Judy, let’s start with one-time versus ongoing. The numbers that we’ve quoted are all our ongoing business. We’ve eliminated the one-time. So then if you focus in on the various markets, I’d say in the short term there have been price increases in both Quebec, Ontario and Alberta as well, earlier in September. That will begin - we’re seeing in Ontario not just the price increase of the premium brands, but we have seen over the last six weeks movement up on the products that are the value brands, which is encouraging. And that continues today. So we’re very encouraged by that. I’d say Quebec - although pricing has been taken certainly to date in this quarter - it remains pretty competitive in that market, and if you go back in time this is really - it happens from time to time in our market place where certain markets get overheated and it usually works its way through in a period of time, but this summer was, starting in the second quarter but really into the summer was a particularly aggressive time amongst all competitors in the marketplace."
Judy Hong,Kevin Boyce,"Just to clarify, Kevin, you sensed that none of the items were one-time, but some of the items that impacted last year were like the House of Blues equity earnings and the Foster’s earnings being included in the last year’s. How much of that really rules the 8% decline in the Canadian profit in the quarter?"," Sorry, I was really referring to the cost inflation and the discounting. There were a couple of items but they were - without giving you the specifics - they were fairly minor in the overall scheme of things. The major items were the price discounting and the inflation."
Judy Hong,Peter Swinburn,"OK, and then Peter, The 5% equity exposure that you have on Foster’s","Thanks, Judy. The two issues aren’t really related. We’ve used a pretty efficient vehicle in terms of actually going to our 5%. We’re not using cash in regards to our prudent sort of exposure, which is pretty limited. We just think the 5% represents a sensible position given our covenant to our banner sheet. In regards to how we use our cash in terms of buying back shares"
Christine Farkas,Kevin Boyce," Thank you very much. A couple of follow ups if I could. Kevin, first on Canada, you talked about early fourth quarter STRs being unchanged, so that’s a deceleration. Do you think that’s on the back of stronger pricing in Ontario and perhaps Quebec, or are you seeing maybe some trade down impact, either away from or towards other categories? What are you seeing there in the early part of the quarter?","I’d say from an industry perspective, the 3.1 was a pretty heated industry and reflected a couple things. It reflected in Quebec a bit of an inventory build, to be honest, and it also reflected early in the quarter. You may recall last quarter I spoke about the timing of the Canada Day holiday, so adjusting for that I think it’s really the third quarter that’s a little bit inflated  rather than the fourth quarter.  I characterize October as okay, not bad, not great, but in an industry where historically we’ve been at about 1% growth, flat for us is probably a pretty good performance given all the circumstances in the marketplace right now."
Christine Farkas,Kevin Boyce, Did you give us an indication of how much currency impacted the Canadian results this quarter?," No, we didn’t, but it was virtually negligible."
Christine Farkas,Kevin Boyce,"Okay, great.  Looking at the segment of the US or other, there was about 98,000 barrels sold under US title.  Is that a timing issue?  Is that Puerto Rico?  What is that number, and are we going to see something like that going forward?"," Is that question directed at me, Christine?"
Christine Farkas,Kevin Boyce," No, Kevin, just in general on your statements or on the Molson Coors statement.  I realize that the US numbers are pulled through the equity income, but there is now a small segment of other - what is that number?","Well, we had one day of earnings prior to the commencement of the JV.  The JV essentially commenced one day into this quarter, so that $4 million represents the profit for that particular day."
Christine Farkas,Leo Kiley, Okay.  You didn’t talk about early fourth quarter STRs for the US business.  Is that something you can cover on this call?," This is Leo.  There’s a lot of noise in our October numbers.  We do have October numbers there that were up marginally on sales to retail, but it really has more to do with pricing and buy-ins ahead of pricing market-to-market.  I think the trend changed and, as you know, one month doesn’t make a quarter."
Mark Swartzberg,Kevin Boyce," Thanks.  Kevin, I have a couple of questions relating to Canada.  I’m trying to put the picture together, looking out beyond the next quarter.  You’re seeing cross margins start to decline.  You’re saying that pricing is picking up but the volume leverage is slowing down a bit, so is there any reason not to think gross margin will continue to be down year-on-year over the next few quarters given the relationship between price and the cost pressures?  That’s a local currency question.  Then I have another question when we bring that back into US dollars.","There are a number of things you’ve referred to.  First, I think when you reflect on the third quarter it’s been a really strong volume quarter with some cost inflation issues.  As you look at commodity prices there was a lag as commodity prices went up, and there will be a lag as commodity prices are coming down.  There are a number of other factors in there.  We’re very hopeful that this trend will continue and that we’ll benefit from that.  That’s the first comment. I think in the very short term the question about volume and things is reflected in the first month of this quarter.  As I said to Christine, there is some loading in Quebec on the price increase that I mentioned.  That will work its way through, so I wouldn’t assume it’s necessarily going to be a flat quarter.  We’re hopeful that it will be what it’s historically been at about 1%. Going forward, cogs in local currency will be our challenge in order to get to flat, but there’s some work ahead of us in order to be able to deliver on that.  It’s a challenge we are taking on."
Mark Swartzberg,Kevin Boyce,"Is that something you think you can achieve?  You say it’s a challenge, but is that something you’re targeting in 2009 or is it going to take longer than that?","Some of it will depend on what’s going to happen in commodities, to be honest, because in the past, if you just look in this quarter 7% would be very hard to offset.  It depends on how much that moderates."
Mark Swartzberg,Stewart Lindening,"Okay, There is obviously an issue with the way the Canadian dollar has performed over the last month or so.  I have two questions in that regard.  If we assume, for illustration purposes, that your currency neutral profits are flat next year, operating income flat, what is structurally there?  Let’s say for illustration the Canadian dollar is down 15% year-on-year versus the US dollar next year on average, what is structurally in place to cause that scenario to not produce a 15% US dollar profit decline?  Have you done anything hedgewise that might add to any structural protections you have? That’s a translation to US dollar profit question.  I’m going to turn that over to Stewart, if that’s okay with you."," Yeah, let me address this.  As we’ve covered in previous quarters, we really don’t get into the details or the specifics of our hedging.  I can point, however, to the fact that there is an important moderating factor which is the fact that we have a substantial amount of our long-term debt denominated in Canadian dollars.  That presents a natural hedge for us."
Mark Swartzberg,Stewart Lindening," That’s nice, but is there anything on top of that?  Relative to the size of the operating income the interest expense is relatively small.", I can’t really give you guys any more details than that.  I’m sorry.
Bryan Spillane,Peter Swinburn," Good morning.  Peter, I just wanted to get back on Judy’s question relative to the Foster’s swap.  If I understand the logic behind buying the instrument, it’s basically making an assumption that the Foster’s stock price is going to go up, so the question is why would Molson Coors be making that assumption?  What other step is there that might be involved strategically beyond just taking a flier on the Foster’s shares?"," There are two points that are really important.  Why have we got this?  I think that’s pretty straightforward as far as we’re concerned.  The Australian market has been interesting to us.  We’ve studied it for quite awhile.  Foster’s is interesting.  We had the opportunity to get into an economic exposure at an entry price that, to us, was very attractive.  We didn’t want to put the business in a position where we had an over-exposure.  We haven’t done that.  What we’ve done, I think, is pretty prudent and sensible within that context.  That’s the background."
Bryan Spillane,Peter Swinburn, So it’s fair to think that there is a strategic reason to do this.," Yeah, I don’t want to misrepresent the Foster’s management, but I think they said that they were in a very fluid situation.  We’ll continue to review our position, and whatever we do we’ll do in the best interest of our shareholders.  I would caution that we could take the view that we could stay where we are, we could move forward, or we might move backward and out.  Whatever we do will be in the best interest of our shareholders."
Bryan Spillane,Peter Swinburn," Okay.  Just to be clear, right now there’s been no cash outlay for this swap?", I’ll pass it over to Stewart.
Bryan Spillane,Stewart Lindening," Stewart, just to follow up on Mark’s question on foreign exchange.  In the seat that we’re in the best we can do without knowing whether you’ve done anything to hedge the translation is to just simply do the arithmetic on currency translation against whatever we’re forecasting for currency-neutral profits in the UK and Canada, offsetting it with the natural hedge you have on the interest.  If you were doing the arithmetic sitting in our seats, is there something else you would do differently?", I can’t say that I would direct you to do things differently.  I can tell you that we’re not really in a position to discuss the specific hedging strategy that we’ve undertaken.  You will have to do the calculations as you would normally.
Carlos Levoy,Peter Swinburn," Good morning, everyone.  I want to very quickly follow up on those questions on Foster’s.  Do you foresee having any role, either in the Board of Directors at Foster’s or any operational link-ups beyond what you already have with the brand?"," No, we don’t see that presently, Carlos.  We have the economic exposure that we’ve announced today, and we’ll just continue to review what happens with Foster’s strategically. And we continue to review what happens with the Foster’s strategic review and what their management does."
Todd Duvak,Peter Swinburn," Yes, good afternoon. Had a question for you on I guess your category exposure. Obviously you’re focused on the beer category. Are you interested in getting into other spirits categories or alcoholic beverages categories, like wine, like Foster’s also has?"," That’s not in our strategic game plan, Todd, no."
Todd Duvak,Peter Swinburn," And then, just kind of following up on that"," That obviously depends on what sort of business we were talking about. But we’re in a very comfortable position at the moment. We’ve got a strong balance sheet, we’re throwing off cash, and anything that we do anywhere will have to be short term agreed to. It will be prudent and it will be in the best interest of our share holders."
Todd Duvak,Peter Swinburn," And I guess just to follow up on that. Your leverage and your balance sheet, as you mentioned, are in a very strong position right now. Could you envision a situation in which you would do something similar to what Conor Riccard did, and forego your investment credit rating for a strategic acquisition?"," Again, that’s just pure speculation. I can’t get into that at all, Todd, I’m afraid."
Christine Farkas,Peter Swinburn," Thanks so much. I just want to clarify based on your earlier statements about not pursuing a share buy-back at this time. Is that strictly based on the challenges of the current market and accessing capital, or is it because you might think you’d rather keep these dollars earmarked for other strategic initiatives? I mean it was always part of your plan to really study that return in the form of a buy-back, so I’m curious what’s changed."," Not at all, Christine. As you know, we’re building cash. We don’t have a huge amount of cash yet, but we’re in the process of continuing to build cash. And we’ll have a number of options in terms of how we use that cash. So it continues to be one of the options that on the table. It’s not the only one, but it’s on the table. We haven’t taken it off the table. Does that answer the question?"
Mark Swartzberg,Peter Swinburn,"Thanks again. Question about the JV Mechanics. If I’m reading the numbers from the press release correctly, the amount of cash that was funneled back up to you at TAP was about $59 million versus equity income of $106.5 million. Is there anything unusual about this particular period, any reason we shouldn’t be thinking that from quarter to quarter at least typically you’re going to be getting all the cash flow back to you? I guess part of the answer has to do with CapEx that occurs there at the JV. But how are you thinking about the relationship between what you get back and what the JV actually generates?","Thanks for that question, Mark. It’s a complicated question only because obviously the JV is going through a period of trying to drive those synergies. We’re been pretty clear that to achieve the $500 million in synergies they’re going to have to spend about $450 million. That doesn’t come in any sort of erasable way. I can tell you from a shareholder, as a shareholder of the JV, we are in a place where we are looking to get the cash from our joint venture as rapidly as possible. We do have a process that we go through each month, which looks to minimize any cash that’s actually held at the JV.  So to the extent that we don’t get cash it’s because we’re putting the cash to good use in the joint venture itself to drive those synergies."
Mark Swartzberg,Peter Swinburn, Is there anything contractual there that obliges them or is it all based on mutual concern?, Well I do think we have a fairly clearly laid out set of contracts that explain what the mechanics will be around the cash transfer.
Bryan Spillane,Stewart Lindening,"Thanks. Stuart, just a follow-up on pensions. So this balance sheet for the quarter shows that the pension liability down to $400 million versus 677. I’m assuming that’s the transfer of the US pension plan to the Miller Coors JV?"," Yes, that’s correct. You’ll see a lot of obviously big movements in the balance sheet that all relate to stripping that out of our balance sheet and putting it essentially in one line as an investment in the JV."
Bryan Spillane,Stewart Lindening, And then as we’re looking at pension expenses and pension funding going forward," Sure. Let me give you a couple pieces. I mean, it’s hard to give a very precise answer here, because obviously with the current equity performance levels expense and expense will likely be higher next year. It’s very difficult to say precisely what number that will be, and I just can tell you from previous years this stuff moves around a lot, obviously while equity may be down, discount rate is up, and it’s very difficult for me to give you any guidance around that. And my best advice is to wait until year end. As it relates specifically to cash requirements of the pension plans, those are driven mostly by various regulatory bodies. In the case certainly of Canada and UK that’s a bit of a triennial valuation. And depending on where that falls, that may or may not drive increased contributions. And I’d say the last thing, which is a moderating factor for us is that the last couple of years we have been gong through a process of trying to de-risk those pension plans by shifting assets from equity-based instruments into fixed income instruments. So mix all that together and you’ll have to wait really until the end of the year to get a better picture of what that will look like. Bryan, the thing I would add is the de-risking that we did was before the recent sharp declines in the equity markets."
Bryan Spillane,Stewart Lindening, So higher proportionate fixed income before the equity markets went down?,"That’s right. If you look at our year-end 10K you’ll see that all of our major plans - call them defined benefit plans - were in the range of half-equities, which was a substantial reduction from before we did the de-risking."
