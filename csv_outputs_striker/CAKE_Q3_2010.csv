Jeffrey Bernstein,W. Benn," One just related to -- it seems that there's a debate between margin and pricing with a lot of restaurants as we look to 2011, wondering if you can give some thoughts on the commodity outlook specifically for 2011, such as what's already contracted or what percentage. And then your thoughts in terms of the importance of maintaining the existing margin and perhaps taking price versus willing to forego some price increase in order to not disrupt kind of the fragile traffic improvement. And then, just separately on the six to nine units for 2011, if you can give some color on perhaps what size of units we're talking about. I know you have the bigger and the smaller box, and then any limitations, whether it be real estate or people, that would prevent you from accelerating that or what might have prevented further acceleration in '11 or what would prevent you from doing even more in '12 and beyond."," Sure. Let's talk first about the commodity cost expectations for next year. When we look at our commodity costs, we call it, our commodity cost basket, which is cost of sales, utilities and labor. And across all three of those basket components, for each of those components, we would expect to have commodity cost inflation of between 1½% and 2%. And with respect to the cost of sales piece, we feel very good about that estimate because most of our proteins for next year are already wrapped up and contracted for. So we know what we're going to be paying for that for those proteins, which are a significant part of our cost of sales, so that gives us confidence in that number. With respect to the labor of commodity cost basket, we feel comfortable with that because we've been doing a great job in managing our average hourly rate. We would expect it to go up some, though, next year as wage rates rise to keep top talent in place. So I think I addressed what you asked there, and maybe I'll let David talk about the six to nine new units."
Jeffrey Bernstein,David Overton, And do you know the breakdown of the six to nine between the different sizes?," I can’t say, I mean, there's 8,500. There's a few 10,000. I think there's going to be one that's 7,200, which we're happy to try that prototype out and the rest of our mixture between 8,500 and 10,000. But really, it's going to be hard to model that because the 8,500 can do $10 million and the 10,000 can do more. So I would just look at those as pretty much all the same except for the one 7,200."
John Glass,W. Benn," I'm curious about sort of your overall, that you overall EBIT margin expectations for next year. And it sounds like the rate of increase will slow maybe even flattish. How much of that is a result of reinvestment in infrastructure that you're going to make next year as you start to open units? In other words, do you expect to continue to -- or start to build or rebuild the branch managers for future openings that you may have depleted over the last couple of years? So obviously, maybe some pre-opening, and I'm not sure if you speak to the margins x preopening or with the preopening. There's some preopening expenses, maybe if you could address that and also talk about if you've also just found more offsetting cost savings as you did this year to help margins along."," Sure. Our expectation for next year on margins is that they improve. So we have improvement. I believe in the guidance that we've given, there’s, take the midpoint of the range, somewhere between 30 or 40 basis points of margin improvement that's in there. And that's after preopening costs, which we would expect would be a little bit higher next year, obviously, with six to nine new units opening. So it's even greater than that, it seems. So those margin improvements are going to come primarily from where they came from in the third quarter and will come from in the fourth quarter, which is from assumed increases in comparable store sales. So if you take the midpoint of our range of comparable sales for next year of 1% to 3% and just assume 2%, we'll get enough leverage from that 2% to generate somewhere around in the midpoint of that range, maybe 30 or 40 basis points of margin improvement. Now with that said, we're still going to be entering next year and not factored into our numbers is any kind of additional cost savings initiatives that we might be able to find and implement. We have implemented big cost savings initiatives, as you know. And over 2009 and 2010, there's not as much left there, but there is something. And we will find some other things where we can save some money, while at the same time, still accomplishing our primary objective, which is to drive guest traffic."
Brad Ludington,W. Benn," I wanted to ask on just kind of trends of the consumers coming in. Are they still remaining kind of stable on the bar sales? I think you said last quarter that that was stable, not up or down. And then also the non-alcoholic sales in IP or soft drink or something at lunch, and kind of also just to throw the other one in I’m going to let you go, does that translate also to -- how is business coming on business spend and any kind of private parties that may book?"," On alcoholic beverage sales, they continue to be stable so that's holding true. Our sales dollars were positive this quarter and our incident rates were slightly positive. So alcoholic beverage sales are hanging right in there. As you mentioned, guests had been managing their check some with respect to non-alcoholic beverages, and incident rates with respect to non-alcoholic beverages are lower. However, in the third quarter, we did see some very positive news, which was some sequential stabilization in non-alcoholic beverage incident rates. So if that trend of stabilization continues, we would expect to begin to capture more of our menu price increases at that stabilization of those lapse around and therefore, no longer having negative year-over-year comparisons. And with respect to business spend..."
Destin Tompkins,W. Benn," Doug, as I look at the third quarter and the labor expense, specifically, it seemed like you didn't get quite as much leverage in the third quarter as what you’d gotten in the prior quarters despite a pretty good comp. Was there anything unusual that was limiting maybe as much sales leverage as what you’d experienced recently?"," Yes, we probably got a little more sales leverage from our cost saves initiatives and from our positive comparable sales and the leverage there and what's showing up on that line. The one thing that we did have this quarter is the bakery incurred some expenses, primarily related to labor with unplanned over time, which was they use to ramp up production to accommodate some big orders that they received that were anticipated and were sort of last minute in nature. And the good news, though, is that external bakery sales, as we talked about, were up 9% in the third quarter. And that we would anticipate fourth quarter bakery sales year-over-year to be up as well. So I think that's what pulled it down just a little bit more."
Destin Tompkins,W. Benn," So it doesn't sound like we should see that going forward. And then, as another follow-up, I just wanted to see if you could quantify what the extra week in 2011 might be worth?", About 2%. So if you take the earnings per share range that we gave and about 2% of that I think would amount to about $0.03 a share.
Destin Tompkins,W. Benn," And then the sustainability or the -- in terms of those costs going forward around the bakery, that over time should lessen?"," It should lessen, yes."
Unidentified Analyst,W. Benn," This is John Cop [ph] calling in for David. Just a quick question thinking about the marketing plan for the next quarter for Q4. I know last year, you called out kind of a shift towards focusing more on gift card-related promotions during the holiday season, and I'm wondering if you can just give more color around if you're planning something similar this year or if you're expecting the focus to be meaningfully different than what you did in the past."," Well, it's going to be a little bit different but a little bit the same. Let me explain that. Last year, our promotion was a complementary slice of cheesecake really with every $25 gift card purchase, and that was a very successful promotion for us. We sold a lot of Gift Cards that were redeemed in the first quarter, if you remember the impact on the first quarter sales. So we're going to be doing something similar to that. However, this year, we're going to be making that offering available online. We're planning to expand our digital footprint by launching a virtual e-Gift Card program and guests will be able to buy their gift card online and receive their complimentary slice of cheesecake online and either print out that Gift Card immediately or send it to someone. So it’d be much more virtual than it has been in the past. And we think that, that should help stimulate and drive some more sales of those items."
Mitchell Speiser,W. Benn," On the gross margin for 2011, can you give us a sense of what you're modeling in there? I would assume there's probably at least 1½% pricing you're taking and just to get a sense of you said 30 to 40 basis points of EBIT margin expansion, if that reflects gross margins up or down. And if I could maybe just slip another one in there, just on what metrics you look at to gauge the health of your customer, is it anything to do with retail mall traffic? Or is it just general macro numbers that we all get?"," Yes, I would look at the margins for next year. The gross margins will be in the midpoint of the range being relatively flat. And then with the margin expansion coming primarily from more fixed type of items like depreciation, G&A to some extent, with a little bit of going the other way with respect to preopening costs. And then, the way that we gauge our customers, I don’t remember what he said, can you repeat that part of it again?"
Mitchell Speiser,W. Benn," I was just trying to get a sense of how you gauge the health of your customer base. Any particular metrics that you look at as you look at the fourth quarter, what you don't know about the fourth quarter and how your consumer is holding up in this environment."," Well, I think our consumers are holding up really well because we've had the 2.8% guest count increases. We have 2.8% more people coming into our restaurants in the third quarter and had some momentum coming out of the third quarter. And despite that, we're willing to say that for the fourth quarter, we would expect comp-store sales gains of between 1½% and 3% in an environment even where we have this negative holiday shift and a hard comparison going on. So we're confident."
Matthew DiFrisco,W. Benn," Doug, I'm sorry, I jumped on late. If you could just go back and if you've mentioned this is already on the price, what you had in the quarter and what might be embedded in that guidance in the fourth quarter to be sustained. And then, David, I had a question with respect to the six to nine opening. Also, I'm also sorry if you already specified this, but should we assume that they're all Cheesecakes? Or are we ready to see RockSugar maybe find a second or third store start to look at those locations?"," Yes, let me talk about pricing first. In the third quarter, we had, well, 1.4% of price in the menu, and I mean in the third quarter, yes. Entering the fourth quarter, we have about 1.3% of menu pricing in because we took a menu price increase in the summer of about 0.7%, which was replacing a price increase that we were lapping of 0.8%. So we took roughly the same amount of price. So basically, the amount of pricing we have in our menu in the fourth quarter is going to be about the same as it was in the third."
Matthew DiFrisco,David Overton, And then the stores?," Yes, they're all Cheesecake Factories. We have one 7,200 square foot test model for Cheesecake and we have one new Grand Lux iteration that we're doing, so that's what will have for next year."
Matthew DiFrisco,David Overton, What percent of those stores are going to be sort of new markets versus existing markets?, There's not a lot of new markets for us. We're pretty much everywhere. So they're all a mix of markets that we're in. There are some new cities but in states that we have seven or eight other stores.
Matthew DiFrisco,W. Benn," And then, I guess what is your first primary use of your cash? I mean, would you think this is an opportunity maybe to take advantage of building out the pipeline for greater growth in years ahead? Or maybe making acquisitions of some lesser brands that have some nice real estate, but you can just sort of put your better format in there?"," Our number one use of cash is always going to be organic growth of our three brands. So while we're saying six to nine for next year, we're pursuing all A locations that meet our criteria. And so that would be the number one use of our cash. Acquisitions are something that are down the list somewhere. We would certainly do -- for next year, if you look at our capital allocation, we'll have over $100 million of free cash flow after those six to nine new restaurants, and we will use that to pay back debt and to repurchase shares. And I would expect that by the end of the first quarter, our debt would be paid down to zero."
Matthew DiFrisco,W. Benn, So a dividend would not be not in consideration?," Well, right now, I think I would say we'll keeping our powder and our options open with respect to dividends for now. We're not ruling out anything in the future with respect to the possibilities, certainly, of paying a dividend. But in the next few quarters, we think we have other excellent capital allocation alternatives to pursue, which should provide good value."
Matthew Van Vliet,W. Benn, Matt Van Vliet on for Steve. One follow-up to the sales mix figures that you gave earlier. I was wondering you could comment on dessert incidents and maybe trends you're seeing there. As well as if there's been any change in the incidents or amount of average check on the Small Plates & Snacks when those are included in an order.," We're not going to break out the Small Plates & Snacks anymore with respect to the amount that are ordered there or the check average related to them. But with respect to desert sales, we still have a positive incident rate. So we’re selling more desserts this year than we did last year."
Matthew Van Vliet,W. Benn," On the six to nine units, could you give any color on when in the year you're expecting those to open? And maybe what the risks to coming in near the six or the potential of actually going over the nine just sort of how that breaks out?"," I wouldn't comment on that second question, but I'll tell you that on the first question, we'll open one of those during the first quarter and probably the rest of them evenly split somewhere between the third and the fourth quarter. So sort of back-end loaded."
Keith Siegner,W. Benn," I just wanted to follow up, a little bit higher level question. You mentioned before how historically you'd priced sufficient to offset the cost inflation. And if you'd look at the COGS line item historically and going back to when you would break up bakery and restaurant costs, you're still floating near historical lows. And actually, when you take out the bakery cost, which is the higher COGS, and you compare it to the peer group, you have one of the lowest COGS out there, so low compared to history and low compared to the peers. Is there a point at which like the COGS really just structurally can't go any lower? Do you think about that? Or is there a point where the value proposition of the food becomes impaired? As you think about pricing going forward in that context, how does that come into play?"," Well, I think that we have shown that what our number one priority is increasing guest traffic. And in order to do that, you have to be very careful about what price increases you take. So we have been steady with our price increases, but not really taking great price increases. We have taken enough to offset inflation and maybe over time, cost of sales have fallen some because of just the mix of items being ordered. But we would look first at being able to make sure that we could sustain same-store sales growth over the long term and be very careful about the balance between pricing and margins. Do you have any other comments about that, David?"
Bryan Elliott,David Overton," I just wondered how much testing have you done for that virtual Cheesecake promotion, taste testing the virtual versus the real."," The paper cheesecakes, they're excellent."
Bryan Elliott,W. Benn, Just a couple of clarifications on the '11 guidance. Does it assume any share repo? Or is the guidance before any share repo?," It assumes share repo. It assumes the allocation of around $100 million worth of capital to either debt repayment or share repo. So it's depending on what's paid off in the fourth quarter, the remainder of debt will be paid down in the first quarter."
Bryan Elliott,W. Benn, And are you locked at all? You said you're locked on proteins. What's the dairy status for '11?, That's not something you can really lock on very well. So we're not locked on that now and we're not for '11.
Bryan Elliott,W. Benn, And your assumption embedded in the guidance is low-single digit dairy?," Well, we're not to comment on every item within the cost of sales guidance. But I would say that we would expect our commodity basket with respect to cost of sales to be up 1½% to 2%, and some of those protein things are down. Some of them are flat. Other things that we know about are going to be up or down. And then dairy, we have an increase in for, but I don't want to go through each of them."
Bryan Elliott,W. Benn," And finally, you talked about the dividend question a couple of questions ago, but just a follow-up to that as well, should we see the pending confiscatory tax regime on dividends be successfully dealt with, would that be a circumstance that you would factor into your thinking about dividends?", Maybe very peripherally. I think the way we would look at it is what dividend can we pay that would be meaningful and that we could sustain for a long period of time and increase over time. And taxes are taxes. And that's not a big consideration.
Brad Ludington,David Overton," David, I just wanted to clarify on the development, I think you said there would be one Grand Lux next year. And also if that's the case, did you say it would be kind of a new test model for Grand Lux?"," Yes, as we've been saying, we're bringing the size down to the 8,300 or so that we found so helpful at Cheesecake Factory. We've worked on the interior of the store a bit. We’ve brought the decor down so it was a little more casual, and people didn't feel it was such a special occasion. And in fact, there's a menu rollout that's happening in a couple of weeks that has a lot of new things on it. So we're really looking forward to opening next year's Grand Lux. And hopefully, it'll be right in line with having Grand Lux be a continued growth vehicle for us."
Brad Ludington,David Overton," And then on the timing of that, would that be the one in the first quarter or one of the ones in the back half?"," No, it's one that’ll be in the third or fourth."
