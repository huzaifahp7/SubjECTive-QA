Joseph Vafi,Peter Altabef," Hey, guys, good afternoon, nice to see the Services business momentum. Peter, can you go back to that Brazil you were talking about on ClearPath and that renewal? And how is ClearPath renewals looking in terms of convincing these banks, especially these banks to step up again and maybe a little more color on the thought process of the Brazilian client. And then I have a follow-up.","Sure. Well, as Mike indicated, we think that the ClearPath business as a whole is relatively stable from 2019 compared to 2018. Renewal cycles vary from year to year. And they vary from quarter to quarter, because these are dependent on when they come in. With respect to the Brazilian bank in particular, we did mention that also in the press release, Joe, so you can get the specific name there. It's really a good example of the way we're approaching the business. So that is a bank that historically has used ClearPath Forward as an operating system for some of its applications, but not for all of its applications. And so, what we've done there is in addition to extending and renewing the license there, we're expanding it, because there are applications that can be put on to ClearPath Forward or ClearPath Forward related applications, they weren't taking advantage of. So specifically with respect to loan processing, you got a bevy of things that banks can do with their core processing. And so, we're actually expanding our footprint in that Brazilian bank. That's a little different from, let's say, using Elevate. So most of the ClearPath Forward, what we're talking about in that Brazilian situation is what I call a backend core banking system. The promise of Elevate, which we just announced a major new release this quarter, is really on the frontend. It's that omni-channel, which really faces the customer. And the idea behind the open banking system, which is our omni-channel approach to banking, is at this point banks really want best of breed. And there are a ton of fintechs out there that are really putting in some really interesting innovative ways. There is an article in the paper this morning. I think you saw that fintechs are finally striking at core banks. Well, by using Elevate, we're allowing banks to take advantage of these fintech innovations by actually kind of a plug-and-play approach. So that's kind of the yin and yang if you will of our financial sector, which is strengthening the core banking, the kind of behind the scenes large processing approach, while also being pretty innovative at allowing people to start doing customer facing banking, which Unisys historically has not been engaged."
Joseph Vafi,Peter Altabef," Sure, that's helpful, Peter. And if you kind of - if you looked at that banking, that ClearPath installed base, say, versus a year ago and susceptibility to replacement by, let's call them, other platforms, if banks are moving away to ClearPath, how do you think you're doing on protecting that installed base? Andâ€¦","I think we've been pretty - yeah, Joe, that's a great question. I think we've been pretty consistent for - I joined the company in 2015. And I think we did an evaluation even by the end of 2015. We have a very strong customer base in ClearPath Forward. There is always pricing pressure. In that, we have a very strong renewal rate. That said, we do expect ClearPath Forward licensing revenue to go down marginally year after year. The rate of decline has diminished substantially in the several years that I've been here and then Mike has been here. But we do still expect that ClearPath forward licensing revenue to decline somewhat year-over-year. Now, that is offset in our Technology sector, but other licensing revenue such as Stealth licensing revenue which we expect to increase. If we take a step back and look at ClearPath Forward in its totality, not just the licensing part, but the warranty work and especially the services work we do on top of ClearPath Forward. Over the past several years, the entirety of ClearPath Forward revenue has actually been increasing. And when we look at the entirety of ClearPath Forward revenue, we expect that to be relatively stable for certainly the mid-term. So it's very strong part of the company, it's an important part of the company, it's not a part of the company we count on as a growth driver."
Joseph Vafi,Peter Altabef," Fair enough. That's good color, Peter. And then just so Stealth, is there any update there in terms of reaching out that product into perhaps larger distribution? It doesn't really seem to be that competitive with firewall, it's kind of complementary and just wondering if there's any updates that you can potentially provide us there.","Absolutely, Joe. And in fact, I alluded to a few of those in my remarks. Historically, as we think about Stealth, we've thought of it kind of with two legs of the stool. And what you're seeing now is us very assertively adding the third leg. And I'll explain why we're doing it now as well. So the first leg has really been Stealth as a standalone offering either from a license standpoint or built into services as a SaaS offering. We have Stealth in kind of a core as well as self-identity. The second leg of the stool is really the way that adding Stealth differentiates our overall offerings. So we have been able to sign much larger deals part of the momentum you're seeing in our TCV and ACV sales is that, in addition to an ordinary course world, we're putting Stealth into those bigger deals and it is being a very, very positive differentiator for us. So that's the second leg of the stool. The third leg of the stool is really starting, I want to say last quarter of 2018 on the promise of Stealth 4.0. So Stealth 4.0, which was launched only in the first quarter actually provides Stealth in much closer to a plug and play environment. It now plays very well with third parties. So you saw me actually referred to three efforts, more than efforts, I mean, wins, for us to expand what I call the distribution [pipe of Stealth] [ph]. So we now actively have Stealth engaged in the LogRhythm environment, in the Palo Alto Networks environment. And as of yesterday, in the Dell EMC environment. So these are big deals for us. And we think over time, this will really expand that distribution pipe for Stealth. So the question might be why now? And it really is because with Stealth 4.0, we've achieved that close to plug-and-play environment we never had before. It's come an incredible way over the last several years. And in addition to that plug-and-play aspect or the easier to configure aspect, we've added something called dynamic isolation, which is almost taking the idea of Stealth and turning it on its head. When the product was imagined, it was really imagined as a very defensive product so that we would compartmentalized data, we would compartmentalized assets. We'd really prevent people from getting to assets and really protect crown jewels. So in addition to relying on firewalls, if somebody got through your firewall or if they were already inside your firewall. They could still have access only to bits of data and not all the data that would be of importance to them. That's been the premise of Stealth really since day one. What we've done now is, say, well that's an interesting premise. But most important to companies is how do they kick people out? How do they stop people from doing damage and/or rummaging around the network? So the idea behind dynamic isolation is to take this community of interest idea, which is always been part of Stealth, which is to limit the access to the specific communities that need access to the data to as soon as we identify a bad actor that identification is done through LogRhythm. It's done through Palo Alto. That's what those folks do. But as soon as they identify a bad actor or now through Dell EMC. We can use Stealth to basically close the door on them and create a community of one. So they themselves get isolated inside their own little world. So we collapse the world on them. And the promise of this. What makes this so exciting to all these third parties and why people are jumping at this and distribution pipe is increasing is because this allows the non-affected part of a network to continue to remain operational. So the idea would be rather than have an incident where you don't have to throw away every bit of hardware you have, you can really isolate the damage as soon as you identify the bad either device or the bad identity of the player, you use dynamic isolation to collapse it. That's really a change in the way we've thought about Stealth, and it too becomes effective with the new version 4.0."
Joseph Vafi,Mike Thomson," That's great. Sounds very, very promising, Peter. That's great. And then maybe Mike, welcome on board. Maybe just one quick one, I know, you're not doing cash flow guidance at this point. I know you're continuing to see good strength in new contract awards that probably have upfront capital requirements are. Is this kind of run rate on capital additions and CapEx? Is this - do we kind of expect this cadence for the rest of the year? I know, you've got longer term goals, but just trying to get a sense of CapEx over the next few quarters. Thanks.","Well, thanks, Joe, for the kind of words upfront, and I guess, I would say to you that my remarks we talked about CapEx for the year and we know we've given that color at year-end and we are given it again that we think the full year value of CapEx should be in $170 million. The CapEx that you saw in Q1 was a little higher, not unexpectedly higher just really due to the kind of cadence in which the revenue or the seasonality of the revenue came into play versus the need on the CapEx. I did note too that we had some additional spend in Q1 related to some prepaid. So we prepaid for some CapEx on a large public deal, so we can get it out of discount, which should further help our margin expansion efforts. And we would expect again with the full year being at the 170 range and our total CapEx to be between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenue."
Joseph Vafi,Peter Altabef, Got it. That's good news. Thanks so much for the extra color. A lot of calls this evening. So apologize a little bit for some other redundancy. Thank for lot.," Thank you, Joe."
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Mike Thomson," Hi, Peter, nice quarter. And Mike, congrats on your first one in the CFO seat.", Thank you.
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Peter Altabef, My first question is what when can we see the margins of the large products that you've taken on start to normalize and start to be accretive instead of to dilutive to your Service margin profile?,"That's a great question. I would say, one, these are staggering, right? So these new comp - contracts are coming in over time. The first ones really came in very, very late in 2017. They came in throughout 2018, as you can see from our contracts, this quarter, we signed almost $990 million of new stuff this quarter. So one way to look at this and I think a more effective way is actually looking at it in that staggered way based of when the contract is signed. Often you will have contracts that in the first 12 months are frankly dilutive. They don't add anything to profitability. And then sometime in the 12 to 15 to 24 months they get more and more profitable. You would expect to close to profitable run rate by 24 months. And that's not scientific for every one of these. But you'd expect two years into this to be operating close to what you would expect to see at least as an average profitability over the term. And then, toward the end of the term, it would go above average. But that would counterbalance the below average in the beginning. So it's really more of a contract by contract approach rather than it is for - to look at the whole thing as a blob. Now, that is ameliorated in the U.S. Federal market, where you don't have as much of a negative in the front or as much of a positive in the back. The U.S. Federal profitability has some variability, but not nearly the amount we see in the non-U.S. work. Mike?"
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Peter Altabef,"Great. Thanks so much for the color. And just regarding your comments on mid-teens growth in the federal market for this year, is that all of the projects and handed in the backlog? And are you really seeing that in Q2 or do you still have to actually win more projects to get to that rate?","Jon, that's a great question too. So, all of our sectors, whether it's federal, public, commercial or U.S. Federal, all have a blend of long-term work and short-term work. And if you go to the investor relations snapshot that we show, you can see - again, I would suggest the non-GAAP, because it's the cleanest. But if you go over there, you'll see that of our total revenues 73% are what we call recurring, 15% are nonrecurring services and 12% are technology, which is really - at this point, the vast majority of that is software licensing. But that 15% nonrecurring is really short-term project. And that short-term project work appears throughout our business, including U.S. Federal. So it'd be wrong to say we have all of that locked and signed, because we do expect and rely on that level of project work. But based on what we've already seen, we would not have given out that mid to upper teens numbers if we didn't have confidence in it. The real fly in that ointment would be if there's some kind of a government shutdown toward the end of the year or whether there are issues with respect to the federal budget. That's not foreseen and it's not in our estimate. But other than that, we feel good about that range of revenue in U.S. Federal. And again, that is all organic."
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Mike Thomson," Okay, great.","I'd like to add one thing there, Jon, like we're expecting to see that federal growth start in Q2. I mean, so that's how confident we are those backlog and those signings."
Jonathan Tanwanteng,Peter Altabef,"Great, appreciate that color. And then, finally, just given your 6% growth in Q1 and your 2% to 5% guidance for the year, are you expecting any slowdowns or just difficult comps coming up? Is there any reason why you're a little bit more conservative given the run rate you've achieved in Q1, even with the federal slowdown?","Yeah. Well, I think consistent with the discussions that we've had today. It's really about the new business and the time it takes to ramp that new business up. So the take up on the revenue side, it's going to have a little bit of drag on the margin. So from our perspective, it's very consistent to what we've seen over 2018 and moving into 2019, so nothing in particular outside of that."
