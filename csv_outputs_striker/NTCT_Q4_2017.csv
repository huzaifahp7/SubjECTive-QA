Mark Kelleher,Jean A. Bua, Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to look at Arbor a little closer. You mentioned there was a large deal – I think you mentioned there was a large deal in the enterprise area. Is there a way you can give us an idea of what percent of Arbor right now is enterprise versus service provider?, It's about – enterprise versus service provider in Arbor's revenue is about 65% service provider and 35% enterprise.
Mark Kelleher,Anil K. Singhal," Okay. And as a follow-up, that growth there seems to be offsetting some weakness at Fluke which is, if I understand is enterprise. Where are we with the Fluke transition? Is that still a headwind or has that bottomed out?"," I think as we talked about, Mark, it has bottomed out now and I think we are beginning to see an uptick and we don't see any real impact on this – negative impact on this in the coming years."
Mark Kelleher,Anil K. Singhal, Okay. Thanks., Sure.
Alex Kurtz,Anil K. Singhal, Yeah. Thanks. Can you guys hear me okay?, Yeah.
Alex Kurtz,Anil K. Singhal," Yes. Good morning. So, the high-single-digit declines in service provider, Anil, if I heard that right, what percentage of that is being driven by just overall spending in that vertical versus transitioning some of your customers to software-only? I think you said 8% to 10% of the business this year will be software-only, but I guess what's that percentage – as a follow-up, what's that percentage in the service provider segment?"," I'll let Jean add maybe a specific percentage, but overall software strategy is that we need to mitigate part of the OpEx and CapEx challenges. So, everything is related to dealing with OpEx and CapEx. We just decided that instead of market forces disrupting us, we rather do it ourselves proactively. And so that's what is resulting in 10%, we are – that number we are forecasting for this year, it was low single digits this year. And next year, we hope that we'll accelerate that beyond 10% and that will result in even better gross margins. But overall, dynamic playing in the sector is that customer has X amount of budget. And unless they can buy sufficient capacity for an X amount, they rather not do anything or do go to cheaper solutions, less attractive, but cheaper solutions. And by we coming up with a software solution and it's evidenced by the couple of (37"
Alex Kurtz,Jean A. Bua," Okay. And, Jean, the Arbor growth at 14% in enterprise, was total Arbor growth approximately that kind of rate or is it – maybe it was higher because of the service provider?"," Yes, the Arbor service provider growth was 40% as we talked about and then it was 14% in enterprise. So, when you blend that together, they came close to a 30% growth rate. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, they had a product transition, that is one of the reasons why their growth rate is so far ahead of the market rate. The market generally grows anywhere from 12% – 10% to 12% and Arbor, when you normalize for that product transition, actually grew a little faster still than the market in 2017, probably mostly due to some of the high-profile events that happened in DDoS and a lot of customers come forward realizing that they have vulnerabilities and then they turn to Arbor."
Chad Michael Bennett,Anil K. Singhal, Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning., Sure.
Chad Michael Bennett,Anil K. Singhal," So, Anil, can you maybe talk about kind of the software transition that you're seeing within service provider? Maybe how the magnitude of the transition from roughly a year-ago period and kind of how your thoughts have changed there. And then maybe you can chat about your competitive strength in a software-only world in the service provider space."," Yeah. So, I think we were – NETSCOUT was always a software company. We just ship most of the software with bundled hardware. TekComms, on the service provider side, was primarily a hardware-based company, custom hardware and that affected, obviously, their gross margin and the combined margin of the company in the service provider sector after the acquisition because they were a bigger dominant portion of the revenue. So, what we saw last year was that we have the best solution and we were the number one and number two player and combined, we have 50% market share and everyone wants to use our solution, but they were looking for two things. They were looking for a better price because of their budget challenges and they were looking for the best of both features in a single product. And that was the number one initiative for the company which is why it (40"
Chad Michael Bennett,Anil K. Singhal," Right. And then, Anil, can you give us an update on your thoughts on both timing and relative impact of 5G on spend to you guys?"," I think we see a very small impact of 5G, but there is an indirect impact on our 4G solution because of the software strategy. So, as people are looking for 5G solutions, they will traditionally look for incumbents who can satisfy their needs both from a budget and a value perspective. So, moving to a software model, the dynamic I just described, allows us to be the number one player in the 5G area, but it's not going to really impact – have any meaningful impact on the revenue in the coming years."
Matthew George Hedberg,Anil K. Singhal," Hi guys. Yeah, thank you. Sorry about that. You guys have talked about getting gross margins back to their historic levels of, I think, near 80%, versus kind of mid-70%s today. I guess, including the release of InfiniStreamNG, can you outline and maybe rank the other opportunities for gross margin expansion?"," I'll let Jean maybe add to this. But I think the biggest opportunity is because InfiniStreamNG has become the combined platform for TekComms and NETSCOUT moving forward, and it's available in the software and appliance versions. And so margins are already increasing even with the appliance version, because it's higher gross margin than the TekComms' custom hardware version. But we think that this will allow us to reach our 80% gross margin target sooner than we would have thought earlier, and maybe even exceed it in the future. Jean, anything else?"
Matthew George Hedberg,Anil K. Singhal," That's great. And then maybe as a follow-up, your security business is doing well. I'm curious, with your international exposure, are you seeing any benefits from the European breach notification? Or is it hard to sort of quantify the benefit of that?"," Yeah. I'm not directly familiar with this. But overall our, I mean, international business is a very big portion of the security business compared to the service assurance business. So I think that DDoS solution, which is sort of universally applicable, has bigger budgets allocated on the international side than what we see in the service assurance side."
Matthew George Hedberg,Michael Szabados," Thanks, guys.", Yeah. Thank you.
Eric Martinuzzi,Jean A. Bua," Yeah. I just wanted to sharpen my pencil here on the Q1 guide. If we start with the $278 million of non-GAAP revenue in Q1 of 2017 and we're decrementing that, you said high teens, just because of this abnormal skewing here in FY 2018. I'm coming up with about – if I use a minus 16%, I'm coming up with about $234 million. Is that a correct algebra exercise for Q1?"," Hi, Eric, it's Jean. I just would quibble on the definition of high teens, I would say high teens would probably be closer to 18%, 19% rather than more of a mid teens, 16%."
Eric Martinuzzi,Jean A. Bua," Okay, all right. Given that substantial drawdown, I'm looking at an EPS decrement of a similar percent versus the $0.28 a year ago. Is that fair? Or is there enough of an offset on the gross margin/OpEx, too?"," No, I think that decrement is probably – I think the decrement flows through and, in our prepared remarks, we said we anticipated that the earnings per share for the first quarter would be anywhere between $0.05 to $0.08."
Eric Martinuzzi,Anil K. Singhal," Okay. All right. And then, shifting over to the Vodafone win. By the way, congratulations to (47"," So I think, when you look at the service assurance, which is the biggest portion of the revenue for the company and, even within service assurance, service provider is the bigger portion for us. So, standardized means that we are the exclusive provider of service assurance solutions and there is no competition in that, and we have – and the standardization also means that, obviously, we have to continue to deliver great service to them, which we're counting on. But otherwise, standardization means that, every time we take an order, there is no price negotiation, there is no contract or anything, it's basically just order. We have a price for our product negotiated based on this deal, and we just order, just from this thing. They don't need to go to various places. As long as they have budget, they don't have to go for approval. So, it makes the process much simpler. So, we have to continue to watch out for other things which we can do beyond service assurance. But overall, (48"
Kevin Liu,Anil K. Singhal," Hi, good morning.", Hello.
Kevin Liu,Jean A. Bua," Just regarding the service provider deal that slipped out of the back half, are you guys still factoring that into your guidance for the current year? And maybe more generally just from the larger Tier 1 customers that you've had traditionally, what's sort of the expectation baked in for the declines over there over the course of 2018?"," Hi, Kevin, this is Jean. I would say that we are – they've been a long-term customer and we're on negotiations and discussions and relationship management with them. As you know from reading the headlines, a lot of these customers have been hit lately with the all-you-can-eat plans. So, it's caused them to stop and really look at their overall spending. So, I would say today that is really the situation that we're in with this particular Tier 1. So, while we don't anticipate at this point any large orders in the current quarter, we are hopeful that they will be continuing to see the value that we've provided to them and continuing to place orders with us over the next three quarters or so. Actually, just to add on one comment. We're also talking to all of the Tier 1s as it comes to our software-only solution. So, if there's any – as Anil talked earlier, where their budgets are being constrained due to their own economics where we have the software-only appliance also, we can give them a price point that more aligns with what their CapEx needs are or OpEx needs today, but continue to provide them with excellent service."
Kevin Liu,Anil K. Singhal," Got it. Actually that ties in well with my follow-up, which is just in terms of the software-only deals, how does kind of the amount of spend you're getting from these customers compare with what they might have traditionally? Or are these really targeted more so at kind of new potential accounts that you haven't touched previously?"," I think there are three numbers – this is a very common question people are asking, what it could have been and nobody knows what it could have been. I think clearly, if they were to buy the same amount of product from us four years ago at the height of LTE spending, the numbers will be significantly larger. But the reality is, we didn't have a software solution, we will not get what we are getting. So, I think this is a short-term disruption, I call it short-term pain, long-term gain, it's a blessing in disguise because ultimately it'll promote one of the best solution in the industry, which is ours to be more progressive in the enterprise and service providers. Even the software solution could eventually be used in the enterprise also. And this will allow us to deliver more value at a reasonable price to the customer. So, that's how I look at it. I think if you compare apples-to-apples, yes, it's significantly lower price for the same amount of product or same amount of coverage versus three years ago, but that's not the right metrics. It is the metrics, what would happen if we didn't have a software solution. And I think the situation will be really bad and will be affecting both gross margin, top line and operating margins. Now we are able to improve gross margin, operating margin, keep the revenue line intact and then grow from that base moving forward."
