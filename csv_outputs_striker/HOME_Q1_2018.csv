Dan Binder,Judd Nystrom," Great, thank you. Congratulations on a good quarter. I have couple of questions. One around the just the cadence of the quarter and how things sort of panned out post-tax refunds and whether you saw pickup? And also on in terms of categories you talked about broad strength I was curious as you look at the next area for category reinvention, what should we see on that front? And then lastly, you mentioned a 40% increase in the e-comm traffic to the website. I am just curious how consumers are reacting when they see that there isn’t really a transactional website there to purchase product from and if you are getting feedback that they want one?"," Great. Thanks, Dan. I will address the first question and then Lee will hit the next one. So, when we look at our first quarter comp, we are very pleased with the performance. And as I mentioned, it was across all the geographies. It was very broad-based and consistent. We saw our everyday and seasonal performed very well, stores greater than 5 years performed in line with the change – with the chain overall. It was our 13th consecutive quarter of positive comps. When you look at the last 13 quarters, we have averaged 5.3%. We did not see the choppiness that other retailers have highlighted. As a reminder, we are a value player and we saw consistent results throughout the quarter. We exited on a strong note and we said that the momentum has continued into the second quarter and we are very pleased with our business through the first 4 months of the year."
Dan Binder,Lee Bird," Great, thank you."," Thanks, Dan."
John Heinbockel,Judd Nystrom," So, two topics. One, performance of new stores in existing and new markets, new stores in those markets, how similarly are they tracking the volume ramp up and are you seeing as we get some multiple stores into existing markets and the ensuing brand awareness pickup, are those stores then maturing at a faster pace? And also would you in a perfect world – would you like to cluster more where you think the clustering is about where you would like it to be?"," Great. Thanks, John. I will address the first question and then Lee will hit the second one around clustering. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we had 18% increase in operating weeks which was slightly below where we were last year on a 22% store accounting treatment. We are very pleased with how the stores opened in the first quarter and as I highlighted in our prepared remarks this year we have the opportunity to have one of the strongest vintages yet. We have a lot of stores that are reopening in the second half of the year that have higher sales volumes, some of which are ground up build. And we are excited about those new store openings of attracting actually ahead of what we had expected. The new and existing we had more new markets in the first quarter for the year its more balanced, its 50-50 overall, so we will see some of those stores that are going to open in the second half of the year that are ground up build are actually going to be in our existing markets and we expect those stores to perform higher. But overall we are very pleased with the stores we are opening up. We are going to stay true to our economic model and make sure that we are open on delivering the return that we expect."
John Heinbockel,Lee Bird," And then with respect to direct sourcing, so how will that interplay with the reverse engineering process and is there an opportunity to significantly further reduce the cost of the products that you are selling?"," Yes. I think for us as the direct sourcing process is going to be a journey. We identified this early part of the year as we have started to work on and we have planned to put some whole lot of energy in the back half of the year against direct sourcing. But as we did our early study on it we found that the opportunities would be even greater as we pull that ahead and that’s why that we have some additional investment in this year than we had originally planned by taking some of the good news in Q1 and investing against as we have always said we will invest against opportunities. So we are investing into direct sourcing. It’s a three phased approach that early stages will be on low design content products. Think of this as product has been in our store for a number of years, it doesn’t take a lot of design at the commodity. For example, let’s take wooden bar stool for example. So that wooden bar stool we have been selling for a number of years, we can direct source that without having a lot of design, without having any additional or new design work on the product. As you move across these ways of direct sourcing efforts, we are going to have to add product development capabilities in side our company. We have to add direct sourcing capability inside our company, so there is a new hires. That’s what’s happening this year. By the back half of the year we will start adding even more to the product development team because by the time you get [indiscernible] we have to do some of the design work ourselves which our product department has been doing for us. That allows us though to take that design direction and make it clear to the factories a lot faster and working through the third-party. We think this will help not only our speed, it will improve our profitability overall. And then we are just going to reinvest it, we are going to reinvest those – that savings which we will see in gross margin against lower price points and improve quality and also against marketing brand awareness to drive more top line growth so we can continue to fuel our top line even greater than that."
John Heinbockel,Lee Bird, Okay. Thank you., Thanks John.
Simeon Gutman,Judd Nystrom," Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter guys. I would follow-up with on direct sourcing, can you remind us what percentage of your cost of goods is currently sourced by agents or third-party, I don’t know if you have given us the percentage. And then, can you hear any parameters around what the cost of that sourcing is meaning, what the overall opportunity for gross margin could be on the savings perspective?"," So overall the answer to your first quarter – this is Judd. Right now we go 100% direct sourcing today, 100% through third-party partners. So we think there is a meaningful opportunity. We haven’t quantified it yet. We have done work preliminary a step what the opportunity is and we are very pleased with it. Many retailers have experienced hundreds of basis points versus this has been tens of basis points. But I want to emphasize again what we highlighted in the previous question. We have industry leading profitability today. So we are focused on taking that and doubling down on our value proposition and using this as an meaningful opportunity to drive brand awareness and to take market share over time. So that way we are going to plan. Overall, we know there is a lot of value there. We have seen others do it and we have been to other companies and actually have done it at other retailers. We are excited about this. We are excited to be of the pull forward. And we have a lot of confidence and a lot of momentum in our efforts. But just remember this is a long-term type way. We will see a little bit of benefits late this year. We will see more next year. And again I want to reemphasize we have industry leading profitability. We want to make sure that we continue to drive our share gains and hopefully accelerate them over time."
Simeon Gutman,Lee Bird," Okay. And my follow-up is just thinking about reinvestments and so you have talked about marketing and now you have introduced direct sourcing, I am assuming that the store growth ramp, I mean is acceptable and suitable for the rate you are going, I don’t think anyone is complaining about it, but can you talk about pushing direct sourcing versus may be ramping up the store growth even faster versus I don’t know if there is other decisions whether there is some online investments that you have considered naming?"," Yes. Simeon, I would tell you we are already one of the leaders in retail in terms of store growth, a 20% unit growth for now 4 years running, it’s hard to match. And we are really pleased with that. We can deliver that I will say comfortably in essence we have put in the process and system to that to perform at that high octane levels. We don’t see the need to go any faster on that. There continues to be a strong supply of real estate to address that not only from a second generation boxes, but also our ability of opening stores and build them ourselves. I would say we do see an opportunity to build our brand, the biggest opportunity is brand awareness. We have got the lowest brand awareness in our category in existing markets that we already compete in and we are less than half of the competitors out there in those existing markets. So why wouldn’t we spend against marketing to build brand awareness in the existing markets, so we want to do that. I would say with the investments against our online, we continue to invest against online I mean Demandware platform was just added less than 2 years ago. If you look at our advertising spend and marketing spend that most amount of money we spend in any categories in digital, we believe that’s where people have decided to make their purchases they have decided to pre-shop. We don’t want to take away what the customer is looking for which is an in-store experience [indiscernible] take it on today great prices and that’s what we offer. We are – our prices will below anybody else’s sales prices and they can see, touch and feel it. They can take it home today. But there are investments you will see in the future to make that connectivity from digital to the store to make it even easier for her to shop our customer and so we are going to make those investments which will be considered digital investments to improve her shopping experience."
Simeon Gutman,Lee Bird, Okay. Thanks., Thanks Simeon.
Matt Fassler,Judd Nystrom," Thanks so much and good morning to you. My primary question focuses on the flow of inventory through the system and its impact on margin, was the impact of inventory handling on cost of goods in Q1 consistent with your plan, is there any change in the allocation of that inventory costs from Q1, Q2, Q3 versus where you were at the outset, what you are thinking that as in the absolute fiscal year?"," Matt, this is Judd. So what we had in terms of receipt in the first quarter was actually right on plan. We went back and we wanted to understand will we have transportation through the P&L with the inventory made from the number of receipts. And it was right on plan for what we expected in the first quarter and we are tracking along that in the second quarter. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks our increase in our inventory really was driven by two things. Two-thirds of it was driven by new stores and that’s the opening and future timing of stores. And then the second was increment one-third of the increase which when we looked at our business on our comp unit basis we have to go back to about 2.5 years ago when we had similar comp units. What we wanted to do is make sure we brought in the inventory to match what the customer would expect. And if you go back 2 years or 3 years ago we had an 8.3% comp overall. So we have been having less units in the store that what we would expect and Q1 reflects more in line with where we were 2.5 years ago. As a reminder, the quality of our inventory is measured as part of our borrowing facilities with our ABL. We actually have a third-party that has to evaluate in the first half for five consecutive years the quality of our inventory has increased as evidenced by our NOLB level where liquidation of our inventory is actually above $1 and that reflects the quality only a handful of retailers would ever had that overall. And we remain very pleased with our inventory. I do want to highlight part of our higher inventory that you would see at the end of Q1 as we have some capitalized transportation costs from Q3 and Q4 last year that will turn over in the second quarter. So we have highlighted that in our outlook. There is nothing changing with our outlook related to that, but we wanted to call that out also in [indiscernible]."
Matt Fassler,Lee Bird," Thank you. But way of follow-up on the same team, I think at the fiscal year end call you talked about the rate of inventory growth beginning to normalize in the second half of the year [indiscernible] about the facts that two-thirds of the inventory growth, so certainly in excess of 20% related to new stores and not that much above the growth rate of new stores and rest of it relates to comp stores, should we see that comp store growth come down close to your same store sales growth or would you expect it to exceed it still in the second half of the year?"," The second quarter we had expected for widen, because we are actually at a low point in the second quarter which is part of what drove our lower comp last year of 0.9. No, I would expect in the back half of the year we would start to more normalize and by the time we exit fiscal ’18, we would be at normalized level more in line with our comp overall. Q3 will come down a little bit. But it still won’t be completely normal. But by the fourth quarter we would expect that to be more in line."
Matt Fassler,Lee Bird, Thank you so much., Thanks Matt.
Oliver Wintermantel,Judd Nystrom," Yes. Good morning. Going back to the capital as transportation costs, I was just wondering is 100 basis points headwinds, that’s still a good number to use for the second quarter and then maybe if you could give us some details on the third quarter and fourth quarter how you think about these transportation costs that probably should level off and the Q3 and Q4 gross margins then – could those be up again?"," Yes. Oliver, this is Judd. So you are correct. You should think about it as 100 basis points headwind. And that is transportation costs, it’s not merch margin, its transportation cost related and it relates to be inventory we have brought in. In Q3 and Q4 and it just matches with the turn of the inventory that we expect to sell through in Q2. As you look at the balance of the year what we highlighted about smoothing our inventory out and our intake out, the efforts we have had over the past four months to do that will make it more predictable around our transportation costs but we should have a less of a variation in that cost overall as we look forward."
Oliver Wintermantel,Lee Bird," Okay, great. And then you mentioned a co-branded private label credit card, if you could maybe share some more details on that, so maybe the timing of the launch and then what the terms are and if you benefit from profit share or you benefit from sign ups, just some more details would be helpful? Thank you."," Sure. I will give you a little bit more detail on it and then we will have a press release when we actually launch it which will be late summer. So timing wise it’s going to be late summer. As a reminder the co-brand and private label credit card, customers will get rewards overall and we will highlight what that is in terms of the value proposition when we do our announcement. We will get a lot of rich customer information and that will help us in our marketing efforts. As we have highlighted before we are building CRM database and that will allow us to do tailored marketing to our customers. We will have an element around loyalty and that will provide the customer with rewards. We hope that the credit card drives two things. Number one, we expect that it’s going to drive basket, so we are going to deferred financing with that. Second, we expect to drive frequency. So the customer will get rewards and they come in more frequently and we will know more about that and that would add [indiscernible] I guess. Overall it comes the information we will have gathered around the customer we will be able to tailor our offerings to them and our communications to them which should drive more frequency around visits as well. And again we will provide more information on the actual program later in the summer when it launches."
Oliver Wintermantel,Lee Bird, Great. Thanks very much and good luck., Thanks Oliver.
Curtis Nagle,Lee Bird," Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First would be I guess given the success you guys have had with the ramped up advertising and potential sourcing savings coming down the line, where do you think advertising could go over the next few years as a percentage of the sales perhaps above 3%?"," Curtis this is Lee. We said we are going to invest against it. I don’t know where it’s going to go. It’s always going to be based on how it performs. We are super thoughtful about what we do. We analyze everything in our business. We are going to look at the marketing effectiveness of each and every medium and each and every campaign. And if we see benefits which we obviously feel the need to do that because brand awareness is low we want to invest against it [indiscernible] against it. And I would – we assume it’s going to go up, I don’t know how far up and as it goes up we expect it would be driving top line performance to deliver those outcomes. I would say we still have awareness at very low levels. I have mentioned before that our competitors in existing market have more than double almost three times our brand awareness, so we got to spend against that. I am really pleased as I mentioned in my prepared remarks about Ashley Sheetz and her performance. I mean she is a super analytical, she is a business person first. She looks at how to build the brand overall and how to do that effectively and financially effectively and not just spend money which some people do out there in the industry. So she partners closely with our operations and financing to measure the performance. We do testing the controls against all of this investment as well. And our early reads are we are really pleased with the investment and we are very pleased with the outcome so far. And I would expect that we will spend against those type of outcomes."
Curtis Nagle,Lee Bird, Got it.," To build on what we have said, we are also focused on maintaining our industry leading profitability, so as we do have gains from direct source and other things we want to make sure that we continue to have industry leading profitability, but at this point growing our market share is a biggest opportunity."
Curtis Nagle,Judd Nystrom," Understood. And then just as a follow-up, just curious if you guys can give any update on the availability or I guess increased availability of secondary sites given continued store closures in the rest of the retail?"," Yes. There is a whole lot of news out there about closures and so that creates great opportunities for us. I would tell you our pipeline has never been deeper. I like the quality of the pipeline and deeper the pipeline the more picky you can be against it. It allows us to not only look at better sites, but it allows us to consider existing markets and impact of cannibalization to be more thoughtful about that. I will tell you we are super disciplined around it. We continue to look at the same way we have thus far. We continue to open up the stores stronger than in the prior year and we want that to continue, that’s enabled by better quality locations and as retailers continue to announce closures, I will tell you our team had the relationship – the best relationships in the industry. So they call us first. They give us the opportunity to look at those locations. We can give them a quick response. We can do those – we make those decisions quickly. Our real estate committee consists of just four people Judd and myself, our Head of Real Estate and our Head of Development, Norm McLeod and then – and we look at those sites analytically on paper. We have the site scoring system where we use Buxton as an analytical tool to help us score the location. We already have the market plan for all those 600 plus locations would be. So as the location comes up, we will see if it’s in a place we already wanted to be. Now like we are just going to say it’s a good idea or not. We already know that’s the market we want to be in or not. We have already scored the box. We have operated – we have scored all operating big boxes over 20,000 of them. We already know what those boxes would be as an At Home store. So we can already have a first look and a first point of view on that right away. So we are prepared better than I think anybody in the industry for this situation which gives us a whole lot of opportunities out there. And I would tell you the deeper the pipeline gives you more flexibility against landlord as well say that we can only afford so much and then we will pass on a deal, because we know we have other options so we don’t have to be desperate in chasing deals. We are supper thoughtful about it and I think that the bigger the supply which we are seeing is only more helpful for us not only today but long-term."
Curtis Nagle,Lee Bird, Thanks very much., Thanks Chris.
Daniel Hofkin,Judd Nystrom," Good morning. Just a couple of questions first on the gross margin, I am not sure if you said, but what were the factors that drove the higher product margins that you alluded to and how sustainable do you feel like those factors are, that would be my first question?"," Dan this is Judd. Though merchandising margins were up as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, the driver of that was the vendor support that we had related to marketing that we actually started collecting last year and we have recognized it over the term the inventory, so that was the primary driver overall of our merchandise margin. We will have that in Q3 of this year."
Daniel Hofkin,Judd Nystrom," Okay. And then just to clarify the direct sourcing, the incremental couple of cents over those second quarter and third quarter that is purely incremental, in other words kind of absent that you would be taking up your underlying guidance by $0.02 to $0.03 additional, is that fair to say?"," Yes. Overall, it would be a couple of pennies. We highlighted in the call we have raised the bottom up $0.01. We do have $0.02 related to direct sourcing overall and those are incremental costs for the year. And we feel very good about our business. We feel very good about the momentum overall. We did increase the midpoint of our range and that reflects the $0.02 of direct sourcing. And overall, when you look at our Q1 performance we exceeded kind of the outlook we provided to you during our fourth quarter call regarding the first quarter."
Daniel Hofkin,Lee Bird," Okay. And then lastly you touched on that little bit before, but on the CRM initiative kind of can you help us understand kind of the timeline you are thinking about there? And what if any sort of expenses will be associated with that over time or is that largely kind of a gross margin impact in exchange for better sales?"," Yes, Daniel. This is Lee. The CRM program, it’s been basically a loyal – we are going to have a loyalty program. It’s not going to be necessarily a giveaway program. It’s a loyalty program that’s going to be an enhanced build off of our existing e-mail program, but we are going to be collecting other customer information to give us more data on our customers to be more targeted on our marketing going forward. That will be in the back half of the year. It will follow the credit card launch. It’s going to be in partnership with a credit card program. And what we are going to do is we are going to be able to be more targeted in our messaging. We will be able to watch and read how our customers come into the store, how often they come into the store, what they are seeing outside the store and then coming in. So, we are excited about the visibility we are going to have against our customer shopping patterns, which we haven’t had up till now. And I would tell you that, there won’t be much of an impact on the margin basis at all. What we are going to be doing really is providing more targeted communication to them to our customers, take for example, right now, we have got to back – we will have back of campus campaigns and programs in June, July and August, okay. Now, I happen to have going back to college and I should get that kind of communication, but 4 years from now I am in and they are not in college anymore, I don’t want that message anymore, it’s not relevant top me. So, we have got customers who do have kids going to college and some that don’t. So, right now, everybody gets that message. So think about how much better we can be when we are communicating and talking to them about that opportunity. So, it’s more around being more targeted and more thoughtful in our connection to our customer versus just blasting out e-mails and blasting our communications going forward."
