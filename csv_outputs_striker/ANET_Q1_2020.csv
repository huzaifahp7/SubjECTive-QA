Samik Chatterjee,Jayshree Ullal," Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Jayshree, mentioned the short-term benefit you are expecting from some of the cloud companies. So maybe if you can elaborate on that a bit, how much of this is the cloud titans. What are you seeing from the specialty cloud providers?Are you expecting similar upside there? And why isn't - why isn't there more confidence in the sustainability of this kind of upside as we look a bit more longer term? Thank you."," Sure. Thanks, Samik. Well, as you know, Arista's cloud titan performance is consistent with the cloud CapEx reporting. In other words, some are experiencing strong spend, some are declining and others are cautious. So, given all the pluses and minuses, I think it's safe to say that for the year, we expect a flattish cloud titan spread. And this is actually an improvement because we've been saying flat to down.So of course, we’ll monitor this closely. As you know, we never have long-term visibility on cloud titans. It's quarter-by-quarter. So we'll inspect more closely, especially for the second half.Now in terms of the cloud specialty providers, they were actually stronger trend for us in Q1. It's pretty cyclical in nature. It depends on different tier 2 cloud providers. Each 1 has a unique architecture. We had a somewhat weak specialty cloud providers in 2019, but they’ve started off well for us in Q1 and Q2.And over time, it will be a matter of economics and what makes most business sense for them. I believe some of them will succeed in specialized use cases. But once again, we're going to keep a watch and monitor this closely in the second half."
Samik Chatterjee,Jayshree Ullal, All right. Thank you.," Thanks, Samik."
Tim Long,Jayshree Ullal," Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the enterprise vertical and maybe on two different vectors, if you can just kind of give us a little color on what you're seeing on large enterprises. And then as it relates to -- you talked about a longer process for the campus move.Could you just talk a little bit about the moving parts near-term given that, obviously, a lot of people are working from home? So it's difficult to sell on-prem equipment. So if you could just give us a little more color there. Thank you."," Yes. Sure, Tim. So to answer your broad question on enterprise sector, I think Arista's brand is very well recognized for data center. And with our 6,000-plus customers, we've got very good recognition there from a differentiated product. And we've already been very engaged with them.So, customers we’ve been engaged with, in fact, we had most recently in February, just a little before all the doors got shut down on us, we were engaged with over 100, 150 enterprise customers. And we had a global advisory and Arista innovate.So our intimacy with enterprise customers is very high, and we continue to do well with them with both existing and new projects. I think where we will be challenged in the enterprise and also in the campus is new prospects. We're not going to get enough face time with them.We're doing a lot of virtual webinars, virtual events, virtual ebCs, it's a virtual world we're certainly living in. But the level of contact for both, product capability conversation, relationship, partnership and in fact, even testing, for both new prospects and enterprise and campus will be challenging. And nobody is in the building to upgrade their campus either.So this COVID-19 will definitely delay our enterprise cycles for new prospects, but it should be okay for new projects with familiar customers."
Tim Long,Jayshree Ullal, Okay. Thank you.," Thanks, Tim."
Alex Kurtz,Jayshree Ullal," Yeah. Thanks. And well everyone is stay healthy. I just wanted to follow-up, Jayshree, on your commentary from the beginning of the call you said, you're planning to run the business versus 2018 levels. I assume that's an OpEx comment?Or is it an OpEx comment that also maybe relates to where you think revenue could kind of tends to allow, at the end of the year?"," Yeah. No, Alex, first of all, I think we have - we understand the first half better than the second half. So, please take this with a grain of unknown and uncertainty in everything. And I know CEOs are supposed to know everything, but I can honestly tell you, we don't know much about the second half.So, what we’re doing is controlling what we can control. And what Ita and I can control is the business and the expense more than the top line, for the year. And Ita, you want to add more to that?"
Alex Kurtz,Ita Brennan," I appreciate that. And Ita, just on the 40% comment, on cloud titan mix year-to-date. Obviously, it would be helpful to have the year-over-year comp, if you're willing to give that."," Yeah. I think in the investor deck, we've put some trends around what the split has been. And how it's looked and we put a range in there for kind of how it played out during the year right during the past year, right?So the investor deck is looking at a past year, trend over the prior year. And then, Jayshree's commentary is more short-term. So I think that gives you a range to work with."
Jason Ader,Jayshree Ullal," Yeah. Hi. Just really two quick ones, I promise are going to be very quick. Number one, is it correct that cloud outperformed in Q1 versus expectations in enterprise underperformed? And then secondly, Jayshree, can you comment on your campus time line of the $100 million? Is that pushed out now?"," Okay, Jason, I think both cloud and enterprise performed as we expected, in Q1. We -- if there was a theme in Q1, which becomes a stronger theme in Q2, I would say, supply constraints in supply chain. Our verticals were pretty normal as expected.In terms of campus timelines, we are on target. We are committed to $100 million revenue in the first four quarters that ends Q2 2020. No change there. But we do expect that the acceleration, I would personally like to see beyond that in the second and third year, we now have to wait and see due to COVID."
Jason Ader,Jayshree Ullal, Thank you.," Thank you, Jason."
Ittai Kidron,Ita Brennan," Thanks. Hello, ladies. Congrats, and I must say you're very brave to offer our second quarter guidance. So I hope it works out. Let me see. A couple of questions for me. First of all, on the supply chain, can you tell us how much revenues spilled over from 1Q into 2Q because of that? So we can understand the true run rate of your business? In 2Q, and again, going back to Alex's question on the 2018 investment levels?Ita just to fine-tune this, does that mean total OpEx 2020 equals total OpEx in 2018? Or is this a run rate comment? I just want to make sure, I appropriately capture that modeling wise."," Yeah. I mean, I think as we sit here today, we would say we're managing it to an overall plus or minus 2018 total OpEx number, right? And again, obviously, as we know more, Ittai, as we go through the year, we will continue to address that further. But for now, that's how we're seeing it."
Ittai Kidron,Jayshree Ullal, And as far as the push out?," Yeah. So to answer that question, Ittai, we did our best in Q1, but we got supply-constrained in March. I think we will be really supply-constrained in Q2. So I do think Q2 is a case of less about demand and more about supply-constrained."
Simon Leopold,Jayshree Ullal," Thank you. Appreciate the opportunity. I wanted to sort of visit the question or comment you made regarding the COVID crisis, making it more challenging to sell new products. I guess what I'm looking for is a better understanding of how much of your business comes from new customers/new products, and I certainly appreciate you’ve got 400-gig products in the pipeline, campus in the pipeline.But I guess, what I'm struggling with is the sense that a lot of the campus was targeting comes So just trying to understand that comment and how to quantify how that fits into the overall guidance? Thank you."," Yeah. Thanks, Simon. First of all, it's important to understand that our $100 million campus target is $100 million. Its small compared to our overall business. We do believe that we can naturally go into our existing customers, who already know EOS and CloudVision.But as I said last year, we were pleasantly surprised by the new prospects and interest in campus. So in a non-COVID environment, I would have expected 60% existing customers and 40% new prospects. In the current environment, I think we're going to go back to a comfort level where our familiar customers are more likely to spend with us.And our new prospects will take time. So it will probably be 70%, maybe even higher on familiar and existing customers in 2020, which was not the trend we were on Q4 last year."
Simon Leopold,Jayshree Ullal, And the implications for 400-gig has that split out as well?, No. Okay. So I was answering your campus question. What was your question on 400-gig again?
Simon Leopold,Jayshree Ullal," Well, I guess, broadly speaking, I think of new, including campus and 400-gig. So I just want to get a sense of how you see the timing of the 400-gig market, if that has slid out versus your prior expectation? And if so when?"," Okay. So first of all, 400-gig, we believe, is truly for our high-end enterprises, semi providers cloud, and very, very high in enterprise, quite the opposite of campus. And as we said before, we expect early 400-gig trials will be in the late 2020 time frame.And actually, material production, general availability due to low cost, lack of cost-effective 400-gig optics and even some of the COVID issues will be in 2021. Nothing has really changed there, but we continue to see that.Now we did have some exciting product announcements. In 400-gig, we introduced the Arista OSFP line card, which is really a low power, a highly compact, plugable Arista OSFP form factor for simplifying DWDM for distances up to higher than 20 kilometers.We also demonstrated interoperability with Sienna with their most dense and spectrally efficient 400-gig and Arista Switch. So our 400-gig trials definitely are continuing with existing customers and cloud titans. But as we've always said, we expect - just to put this in context for you, in Q4, the number of 400-gig ports according to market researchers is 5,000 ports.However, the 100-gig ports was several millions, so there's 1,000x magnitude difference between the two. And I don't think that's going to change in the near term."
Simon Leopold,Jayshree Ullal, Thank you for taking the questions., Absolutely.
Jeff Kvaal,Jayshree Ullal," Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could help us understand the nature of the demand change over the course of the quarter and into April, just so that we get a little better sense of how you were thinking about the second quarter developing? Is it going to end strongly? Or is it improving through the quarter, that type of thing?"," Okay. So I think we have yet to experience the full impact of COVID-19, I think we'll see much more of that in the second half. So if I look at Q1, we experienced it at the tail end, mostly in terms of our supply chain. And if I look at Q2, we'll still be very supply chain constrained.So I think we understand Q1 and Q2 better, and both of them were -- Q1, as you know, is seasonally slow quarter for us. It really picks up theme in March, and we couldn't pick up enough theme, because we couldn't ship enough.And that theme is going to continue into Q2. So Q2 is all about shipments. We do see, as we said, good strength in the cloud titans, and we see reasonable demand in Q2, but I think our real worry is second half."
Jeff Kvaal,Jayshree Ullal, Okay. Are you able to share with us kind of a loose dollar range for how kind of a loose dollar range for how in either the first or the second quarter?," Well, I think the first quarter is done, but you can tell, we projected lower than consensus. You can count all of that and more as supply chain that and more as supply chain related."
Jeff Kvaal,Jayshree Ullal, Okay. Thank you both very much., Thank you.
Aaron Rakers,Jayshree Ullal," Thanks a lot for taking the question. Kind of a different way of maybe asking the same question again. But I'm curious of how you think about the demand profile from the cloud guys. We're seeing industry reports talking about pretty healthy server demand at several of these public cloud vendors.We've seen the numbers from Microsoft and others. And what kind of the lag effect you see between server footprint deployments or expansion versus actually pulling more network bandwidth means and obviously, a benefit for Arista?"," First of all, we do see cloud titan use case demand in basically three areas. Either our customers are adding additional core or spine capability or they're expanding racks to increase their server density or in some cases, we're also seeing some geo expansion for their international needs. Although some of them have been ordered from the United States, increasing our U.S. titans contribution.So I think the use cases for us is very, very clear. What we also see is that because we have long lead times that Anshul and the team are working very closely on really understanding and sharpening their forecast and timing and working with us on scenarios and contingencies.So I think when they are starting to look at their 2020 deployments, they're not just looking at Q1, Q2, they try to give us visibility for the second half as well. And so while we have not factored any of that into our Q1 or Q2 forecast, we are seeing them doing some very prudent planning and for business continuity in their 2020 time frame."
Aaron Rakers,Jayshree Ullal, And if I heard you – go ahead.," Anshul, would you like to add some more to that?"
Aaron Rakers,Jayshree Ullal, And that's a great answer. It's a stable meaning. You expect the full year to be stable for cloud versus previously saying it would be meaningfully down?," Yes. Like we said, Aaron – Like we said, Aaron, we said, we expect the cloud to be flat year-over-year, flattish year-over-year. And then just to clarify before we get all wrapped on the revenue deferred thing again, when we're talking about the commentaries around the business and the trends of the business.And then obviously, we still have to deal with the deferred after that, right? But it is an improvement from – we had talked about the business being flat to down, and now we're saying we think it's stable in that context. And then the deferred is additive to that afterwards, right?"
Aaron Rakers,Jayshree Ullal, Thank you very much.," Thanks, Aaron"
Ryan Koontz,Jayshree Ullal, Great. Thanks. I asked about the service provider segment in somewhat of a laggard. And are there any kind of new strategies or products that you guys are rolling out? Or is there a different sales motion that you think going to invigorate that segment? Thank you.," Yes. No, thank you for that. We have been marching towards more and more product capability. In fact, we just introduced EOS software release 4.20.4, very targeted towards cloud grade routing and service provider paring use cases with a single EVPN control plane and segment routing and MPLs on the data plane, just a chalk full of features, BGP, flow aware, transport label, NPLS, segment routing, traffic engineering.What I can tell you is we're getting richer and richer in our product capability. But what I can also tell you is service providers take time to operationalize these things in their network. We are doing okay in our already existing service provider customers, and we are starting to win some small Tier 2 and Tier 3 ones, small ones, but too early to call and too early to say much more about it."
Ryan Koontz,Jayshree Ullal," Great. Thanks, Jayshree."," Thank you, Ryan."
Erik Suppiger,Jayshree Ullal," Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just discuss how the large enterprise accounts are getting impacted by COVID-19? Is it a sales execution issue where calling on the customer is the challenge or is it actually a personnel issue where they've got people staying at home and not in the data centers, deploying servers and switches? Or where is the disruption most impacting?"," So Eric, I would classify it in two ways. I think the large enterprises that are already intimate with Arista and need to make incremental enhancements. We're okay. They are familiar with us. They know how to work with us. We are supporting them. They are our systems engineering team, led by Ashwin, our Sales Team led by Chris Schmidt have tremendous amount of engagement with our existing customers, right?So I don't see a dramatic change yet in sales engagement or product differentiation. Where I do see difficulty is prospects. So we're having a tremendous amount -- we have been having a tremendous amount of new customer logos. And our new customer logos continue to be healthy and we gather steam, especially internationally, where we have 60% of our new customer logos come in.However, to convert them, especially into large deals and large enterprises requires large group of concepts. Number of network design clinics and obviously, were slowdown due the lack of face-to-face. So we're spending more time with them training, educating than we are able to do in deployment, whereas with our own existing familiar enterprise customers, we can march forward with more progress."
Erik Suppiger,Jayshree Ullal, Okay. I think very helpful. Thank you.," Thanks, Erik."
Meta Marshall,Jayshree Ullal," Great. Thanks. Maybe just one for me. You noted kind of strong behavior out of some of the Tier 2 clouds. But has there been any change and thought? Or is it just too early as the Tier 2s go forward, whether they will continue to kind of build their own data centers or leverage the public cloud more? Do you expect kind of the -to have any change to that behavior? Thanks."," Meta, that's a good question. And I said before, it depends on the Tier 2. We know some of the larger Tier 2s have paused, and it's not that they're going to the public cloud, but they're just pausing their spending. Others are expanding their data centers and some of the smaller ones are continuing for their specialized applications. So it's my belief that they will continue to succeed in their special use cases and complement the public cloud, but it will be cyclical.They didn't do much of it last year and I think some of them are coming back this year. And what we are seeing is the specialty clouds are realizing that some of the workload, they can control better and some belong in the public cloud. So I don't -- I think they'll continue to have a place.And in fact, a good example of that was content delivery network guide. We saw improved traction with the CD customers, and there's some real real-time streaming and content delivery, particularly with work from home with the millions of users and the aggregates of 4K and 8K flows, you can see why they would make some important investments there."
Pierre Ferragu,Jayshree Ullal," Hey. Thank you for taking my question. One more on cloud. So on this perspective that you'll have flat revenues between this year and last year, I was wondering how your mix is going to -- you see your mix evolving? And a couple of things I have in mind is, what you sell at the lower end of the hierarchy in access, server access at the lease level versus things you sell higher for DCI, for universal spine.And also - or maybe another way to look at the split would be Tomahawk based products versus based products versus Jericho-based product. Do you see a significant evolution in that mix between this year and last year? Thank you."," Thank you, Pierre. I would say in a short answer is no. We've always had a very nice mix of value products with the Tomahawk and Trident family connecting to servers. Sorry, the volume product and then the value products with the Jericho family with the 7,280 and 7,500 flagship, so depending on the use cases, customers opt for both.They're both very, very popular products, and both are currently challenges the lead times as well. It's not so much that we're seeing a change in product mix. I would say the biggest change we're seeing is people are doubling down on 100-gig and 400-gig is getting pushed out next year in the cloud."
John Marchetti,Jayshree Ullal," Thanks very much. Jayshree, I'm curious with the supply constraints that are going on right now, if it impacts any one of the verticals a little bit more than any of the others, or it's broad enough that it's kind of having an even impact across the group.And then Ita, just sort of as a follow-up to that, you sold a bit out of inventory, I'm guessing because you bit out of inventory I'm guessing because you couldn't bring some other stuff in. Is that something that likely occurs again here quarter?"," Yes. Maybe let me take that first. I mean that's kind of -- that's a onetime thing where -- when things are constrained, it's a good opportunity to go look at what you an inventory and sale some stuff that maybe we haven't thought we would. But I think we're through most of that now.So that's why I think the guide for gross margin comes back to the typical a 63% to 65%, and then it will just be driven more by customer mix than anything else, right."
John Marchetti,Jayshree Ullal, Thank you.," Thank you, John."
Sami Badri,Jayshree Ullal," Hi. Thank you. I was a little bit curious if you could give us a little bit more of maybe an idea on dynamics or just maybe some observations you've had in 1Q 2020, what's going on in Europe. And are you competing against different companies? Or are they offering different types of products, at least in the European region versus what Arista has to offer?And I know you've made comments that, a lot of your customers in the U.S. want to take you 1 also in Europe. But have you seen dynamics change, either pre or post COVID or anything going on in 2020 that you can shed light on as an observation?"," No, I think for Arista, because our presence internationally is somewhat new. We are feeling stronger in terms of our investment in sales and different countries. So country-by-country, we feel better about Europe now than we did, say, even a year or two ago.What I think is the difference between Europe and the United States is, they don't have the equivalent of cloud titans. And we haven't won major service provider titans. So we tend to have smaller wins, but many customers.And I think that's -- but country-by-country, the level of engagement, in fact, my -- our entire executive team was at a Europe customer session last -- was it last November? We were all there. It seems like forever, but it wasn't that long ago. And the level of intimacy that the team has developed with our customers especially in the developed countries Germany, U.K., France, Middle East, even Israel has been very strong. So I think the European customer base is embracing Arista for its differentiation and value add. But we just don't have the size of customers we do in the U.S."
Sami Badri,Jayshree Ullal, Got it. And then just maybe competitors or competitors a little bit different in Europe? Or are you seeing similar competitors in both regions?," That is similar, very similar we don't see the difference, at least not in Europe. In Asia we tend to see some but not in Europe."
Sami Badri,Jayshree Ullal, Got it. Thank you.," Thanks, Sami."
Amit Daryanani,Jayshree Ullal, Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess perhaps you could you perhaps elaborate on what specifics [Technical Difficulty]," Amit, we can't hear you. You're choppy. We lost you. You were dealing with - go ahead."
Amit Daryanani,Jayshree Ullal," And if you did not have the supply chain issues or bottleneck what you are dealing with and if you did not have the supply chain issues in theory, what would the June quarter guide have looked like? Would it be towards the high end or something different?"," Well, it's difficult to speculate since we have supply chain issues. But -- and the reality is different than the theory."
Amit Daryanani,Jayshree Ullal," I was more trying to think guess, could this help you and maybe size how much it would help you in the back half of the year, when the supply chain bottlenecks alleviated and lead times normalize. But maybe another way, I guess, maybe if you could help us.Is there a gross margin impact you're dealing with because of the supply chain constraints? Is the way to quantify that in the first half of the year? Thank you."," I mean, we saw a little bit of incremental spending in Q1, but it was very small. We will see some in Q2. But again, I think it's manageable at this stage, right? Again, I'd go back to the 63% to 65%, and we'll be - the midpoint of that range is a good place to start, and then we'll see how we go.So there is some incremental costs because you're prioritizing supply over some other things, but at least in the first half, we don't see something that's really significant."
Amit Daryanani,Jayshree Ullal, Thank you.," Thanks, Amit."
Alex Henderson,Jayshree Ullal," Thank you very much. Jayshree, I was hoping you could give us some insight into the way enterprise executives are thinking about conditions, what they're thinking about in terms of? How they're approaching spending? You made a comment that I think is probably accurate, which is you're more concerned about COVID in the back half.And I assume that’s not supply chain related. It's more demand related. I would assume that you've done a lot of calls with top executives at firms. What are they saying to you about the business in process, the programs that are already in place are getting completed.But maybe the pipeline is falling off as you exit the second quarter and that there expectations for spending in the back half may be hard to put it any other way, sharply constrained?"," Right. So Alex, that's a good question. I think our enterprise decision-makers and key executives are struggling within once in 100-year phenomena, just the way we are, right? They all do have 2020 plans and deadlines. And they would very much like to work with Arista and overcome the supply constraints to meet them. And I believe they will.I believe they'll also take -- many of them will also take not just a 2020 horizon, but a multiyear horizon. And start thinking about how to plan for projects in this virtual world. So we do see some systematic prudent planning. And while we don't have visibility to that demand, we don't think demand will be challenged significantly if they plan prudently.Where we think demand will be challenged, like I said before, is new projects. People are familiar with Arista, people who have to do a lot more testing with Arista, people who love Arista, but haven't had a chance yet to get their hands on it.So that part of enterprise customers – may be more comfortable with doing nothing or being as is. But certainly, the 6,000-plus customers we engage with really, really want to work with us, and we'll continue to plan their projects this year or next year"
Alex Henderson,Jayshree Ullal, Great. Thank you very much.," Thanks, Alex."
Ben Bollin,Jayshree Ullal," Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could step back a little bit and tell us your thoughts, bigger picture about broader hyperscale investment. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm just I'm just interested how you think about these customers longer term.The framing for that near term, we're seeing these kind of material demand drivers, migration to Saas, adoption of cloud need for Elastic capacity addition and in the interim, not seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves.So I'm seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves. So I'm interested how you think about it longer term, what are the material drivers that kind of accelerate growth rates? Any specific factors that you think could be meaningful for an acceleration in the broader investment? Thank you."," Thank you, Ben. Well, look, I think the greatest acceleration for Arista came when the cloud titans made a huge migration to a lease fine architecture and especially standardized on Arista's EOS for 100 gigabit universal spine.So - and then on top of that acceleration, a number of titans co-developed with us, our join development focus that allow them to scale those through distributed datacenters all over the region and all over the cloud.So I think the next acceleration comes from more used cases, with 400-gig and 100-gig with the possibility of extending the data centers and their server density and their storage capabilities.And I don't think that’s necessarily this year but it could be in the next three years. So we will have to be a repeat or how we succeeded in 100-gig and 400-gig levels. Anshul, do you want to add something more to that?"
Woo Jin Ho,Jayshree Ullal," Great thanks for squeezing me in. A longer-term question as it relates to the enterprise. Has the nature of your conversations with your close enterprise customers changed at all? This may be a little bit premature.And the reason why I ask is, given that we're at a stay home, zero touch environment, one would have to think that the network automation, thesis should start playing out a little bit faster given that no can get to their networks anymore. How does that fit into customer conversations today?Do you think that will evolve? And especially given that you do have big switch that provides that enterprise -- hyperscale cloud-like environment to the enterprise that might be a positive to you guys in the long-term."," Yeah. No, Woo Jin, you really bring up a good point here. We tend to talk about data center and campus and all of these different use cases. But our customers are thinking more and more operationally. It's great to have a box. But how to ignite that box with the right operational capabilities is very, very important.And so when you look at it, you're absolutely right, day zero, day one, day two, zero touch automation, one click for the campus, data center, huge topic. The other one and this is why we bought Big Switch is not only are we igniting real-time streaming telemetry and cloud vision.But we're really extending that into the observability and network package relative space and we're very pleased with the sort of sum of data analyzer, cloud vision and now fix iCH to extend our dance monitoring fabric.So that trial or combination is going to be very important 50% energy so our enterprise conversations are going beyond that’s complete platform to much more operational automation analytics, availability and in the future security and segmentation as well."
Woo Jin Ho,Jayshree Ullal," So just follow-on on that, Are these conversations that you've been having that's been ongoing for quite some time now? Or does the -- I guess, the pandemics crisis accelerate that and potentially force customers to make a left turn and they're purchasing decisions or the architectural decisions causing purchasing delays?"," Yes. I think it's too early to say it's because of the pandemic. They were going on anyway, but I think the importance of them becomes greater if the pandemic continues longer. Right now, I think we're getting more hammered on supply chain, but if we overcome that, I think we'll get much more on automation and analytics. Last question."
Ittai Kidron,Jayshree Ullal," Great. Again just a couple. One for you, Jayshree, and one for your, Ita. Jayshree, do you get a sense of -- if there was any business activity in the quarter that was just a pull-in from second half plans into the first half, given the effects of work from home that some customers so pressures that they had to respond to quickly and did it by pulling in budgets.And for you, Ita, on the 2018 OpEx comment, I understand T&E, you're clearly saving a lot of money there. But are there headcount reductions planned as well? Or this is just less marketing, less travel; you're not flying business anymore. How do I think about that?"," Yes. I mean, I'll take that one first, maybe just -- yes. No, I think we are preserving kind of employee talent. That's probably our most important resource and we’re definitely focused on doing that and reading. We’re looking at other areas, other more variable expenses, onetime type expenses that we can manage hopefully, in a near-term window and preserve kind of employees and the talent base."
Ittai Kidron,Ittai Kidron," Very good. Good luck, ladies.", All right. Thank you.
