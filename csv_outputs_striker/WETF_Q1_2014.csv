Jason L. Weyeneth,Luciano Siracusano,"Thanks. The first question is on the Hedged Equity products, I guess, how do you think investors are using the product? Do think it’s more of a way to remove currency risk or to take an active currency bit in addition to the underlying exposures. I’m asking in the context of the DXJ market share which is obviously grown from about 12% to close to 40% today, I’m just trying to gauge defendable that market share position might be in the extent of a continued pullback in Japan demands?"," Hi, thank you for the question, this is Luciano. So I would say, in the case of DXJ, it reflects the investors view on the direction of the yen, if they believe the yen will lose value or depreciate from here. They typically want to hedge the yen out, particularly since Japan is a unique market, where the equity market is actually negatively correlated with the currency movement. So if Prime Minister and the Bank of Japan are effective in their policy, and people believe the yen will reconfirm here. We would expect there to be continued demand for DXJ, which hedges out that impact. With respect to Europe hedged – hedges out the euro, there it’s a different story. I think people are using it to reduce volatility of the European exposure and they may continue to use it if they think there is more aggressive monitoring policy coming from the UCB that would actually target the euro to try to stop its depreciation."
Jason L. Weyeneth,Luciano Siracusano," Thanks. And then just another one on WisdomTree Europe, (indiscernible) developing products specifically for Europe and if so can you talk about how you manage that without diluting the U.S. product development efforts?"," Sure. We’re continuing to look at equity markets around the world. We’re actually going to be launching a European dividend growth fund next week, which will attempt to give exposure to European and UK companies that are growing dividends on the continent. So that would be a third major European exposure for WisdomTree. And we think that will complement our existing product line."
Surinder Thind,Jonathan Steinberg," All right. Good morning, guys. I will just kind of start off with the question around the taxes. How much leeway did you guys actually have in determining when to recognize the DTA and stuff?"," Thanks, Surinder. So there is a lot of judgment that goes into one, you sort of released the valuation allowance. And so we’ve kind of been on the cusp of that, but I would say, one, we’ve passed now three years of profitability, but there is one main event that really pushed us over that threshold. And that was really if you look our results this quarter, even in a period of where we had no growth, we still had a very solid financial results, diversification efforts are proving to work. We saw outflows in funds where we had a lot of exposure to inflows and other products. When you look at the combination of that together from an accounting standpoint, it really push us over the edge, we believe more likely than not they are going to be – we’re going to sustain profitability and be able to use those NOLs. And so that’s why we have to release the valuation allowance this quarter."
Surinder Thind,Jonathan Steinberg," Thanks. And then, maybe touching just based on Japan and the overall strategy there, with the release or the introduction of a series of new sector ETFs there, it seems like you guys are looking at potentially a much bigger longer-term opportunity but is there also chance that some of those products may be taking market share from DXJ itself?"," Well, we want to have a large footprint in Japan, DXJ is a security that’s known well in Japan and we’ve notified the Japanese regulators are certain of our Japanese funds so this broker-dealers in Japan that have an interest not just in DXJ, but also in the sectors. We believe that has Japan develops and more money is going through it people may want to make more granular bets. This but obviously a lot of interest in DXJ, this sector is just give them another way to tilt or work with their tactical bets within the Japan market."
Surinder Thind,Jonathan Steinberg, Excellent. In terms of traction in seeing take-up of some of the DXJ or what kind of the ramp are you guys expecting in terms of the local population there with the FSA approvals and stuff ultimately once that’s all done the products are gaining traction there?,"Well, as far as to speculate. We don’t directly control that we’re just making it available get make sure that people are aware of it that’s just the function of demand generally in Japan. And one of the drivers hopefully going forward will be more equity participation by Japanese investor in there certain reforms in tax incentives in place now to encourage that. A lot of the activity in 2013 came from investors outside of Japan. So we would expect creating funds, hedge funds who are interested in Japanese equity story, once they become await that these sectors under the years may start to use them. There weren’t any other Japanese sector funds in the market and you seen how successful sector funds have been in the United States. So we think it’s a good chance to give people the choice and new tools to manage their exposure to Japan."
Mike J. Grondahl,Jonathan Steinberg, Hi good morning guys. Can you help us think about your marketing strategy and marketing dollars around new funds maybe versus in favor or high demand fund? How do you kind of allocate that marketing spend?," Hi, Mike its Jono. We are flexible, we have a growing inventory of television ads that we can market the some of the exiting funds, if we think they are in favor or sometimes we have television ads for new funds. The television ads really do create ticker awareness and then we support the awareness with lot of research on our website that really helps the sales team to sell that fund and to help create the reason and how you might put the funds into your portfolio. Sometimes they were being aggressive in trying to create the awareness with something is really working. So recently you’ve seen some India ads on television in the first quarter, India has some outflows the market started training better in the second quarter as they were approaching their election and so we seen some inflows actually in India in the second quarter. We’ve also just try to make the most of the investor interest in the European exposures hedging DFE which have been put in on television quite a bit."
Mike J. Grondahl,Jonathan Steinberg," Okay. In your distribution channel, are you seeing anything new different in terms of just where you’re emphasizing things?"," It is a new channel, what we’ve seen in the first quarter of this year has been a lot of interest as John I’ll said in Europe some of the larger inflows have gone into the European team ETFs. So we have made hedged in DFE a major priority in terms of our education program and advisors across the country. So, that’s a unified approach we’ve used across the channels and we think it’s had a lot of success. And I’ll just add to that so has just currency hedged generally as a theme. Currency hedged is now represents the largest portion of WisdomTree’s equity assets and there we feel we are mind share leader in educating advisors about had a hedged our currencies other equity."
Mike J. Grondahl,Amit Muni,"Okay. And then maybe just one for Amit here. Amit, how are you thinking about pretax margin kind of in this $30 billion to $40 billion range for AUM?","You are right, so. We have given three sorts of margin targets right. On the shorter term, we’re expecting a 40% operating margin and $35 billion of average AUM and that guidance hasn’t changed and the longer-term margin guidance that we gave was expecting a 30% operating margin and about $55 billion to $60 billion of average assets and US assets that are current revenue capture. We’re still on track that’s our goal for the US business operating and goes margins."
William R. Katz,Amit Muni," Hi, thank you very much for taking the questions. Just starting with the margin, so that the gross margin Amit you provide the first it’s little bit higher than when you were previously, how does it get affected, if you will to the effect affected, if you will to the effect non-US business wants to grow. And then since your overall margins are constant. Are you looking to the sort of re-invest the incremental gross margin relative to last quarter guidance?","There is couple of things happening on the gross margin. Let me first focus on the U.S. parts of the business. We’re switching our backlog services to State Street. And so we’re expecting to see an improvement in that gross margins and then so the guidance that we’re giving is, we’re expecting like gross margins be between 80% and 83% for rest of this year. On the non-US part of the business, we are expecting that’s the boost related leverage in interest products are very high margin, are very low cost actually operate those funds. We gave guidance and what we think the overall cost is of running that business in 2014. I am not going to get into the details of all those European products right now we get that more as we get further on in the year."
William R. Katz,Jonathan Steinberg," So, we should assume just Matt that the overall margin targeted company being unchanged that the gross margin improvement would not necessarily filter down at earnings at this point?","Well, again, we would expect some of it, but the guide remind you build that, we’re growth company we still want to make the right investments in the business, we are going to spend $6 million to $9 million on the strategic growth investments right now. We’re kind of trending towards the lower to middle end of that range, but the goal is to continue to make those right investments in the business, not about really the short-term to get to those margins as fast as possible. So making the right investments in the business will support the revenue growth."
William R. Katz,Luciano Siracusano," That’s very helpful. And then you’ve done a very good job collectively expanding your products at any distribution channels. Can you just talk a little bit about the traction you’re seeing in, maybe in the Latin American distribution area, that seems to be an area we are focusing, what percentage of flows or growth sales maybe coming from that and maybe still early days, and so I’m curious what the – some of the early signs over there?","Hi, this is Luciano again. So we get very good data in Latin America, because the ETFs assets there can be tracked pretty precisely. So at this point you have about roughly $650 million in assets across the region, about 75% of that is concentrated today in Chile. That number in Chile had been higher, but there had been some selling in the second half of the year there. We’ve listed or cross listed and cleared some of our ETFs with pension regulators in Mexico and Peru. So, now the conference team in Mexico and Peru and even Columbia have more opportunity to sell including ETFs. And we hope that Bill, start to track assets, so pension systems increased adoption of U.S. traded ETFs."
William R. Katz,Amit Muni,"Okay. I just have two more, thank you for taking those questions. Just Amit on the 40% tax rate, it’s obviously relative not given you New York City headquarters if you will. Is there any opportunity maybe just mix as Boost growth, but any opportunity to potentially reduce that tax rate, any opportunity maybe leakage if you will?"," I mean, we’re going to look at ways to see if it’s possible, we can reduce that effective tax rate. As we mentioned, we are in New York state, we are New York city, we believe this is the right place for us to be. This has got a town pool, we believe really is for our industry. But we will look for incremental ways to see we can possibly reduce that tax rate going forward."
William R. Katz,Jonathan Steinberg,"And last one Jono for you was just, you’ve highlighted in the past that you when considering on sales call, the flows will flip more and decisively to the ETFs. And if you look at the equal number, certainly nice snapback in overall Q1, but I see I – it continues to be pretty stable itself when you look at sort of the active business. What are the things going to be the catalyst to really move that market share more deeply in the pass of on a go-forward basis?"," I think it’s one would be education, so I think that really is more investors become aware of really the tax benefits of the ETFs structure, you’ll see more success there as the business model of its financial advisors continues to move to the fee-based model. We will continue to take market share there. And then as we continues as an industry to innovate with things like smart data and all these unique innovative exposures that we and the industry are launching, we should continue to able to take, grow market share from next standpoint as well. So I think it’s inevitable, but it’s – I think it’s inevitable really."
Stephen Jones,Luciano Siracusano," Hi, thanks. This is Stephen Jones standing in for Marc today. Firstly, I just want to start, there has been more product launches year-to-date, more marketing and pressure around this smart beta team. I was hoping you guys could maybe speak to the competitive dynamics there, maybe in your conversions with advisers WisdomTree is differentiating? And if you’re seeing maybe their early signs of any fee pressure in the space?"," Hi, Stephen, this is Luciano. So, last year about a third of the inflows into the industry came into so called smart way to products, products that were weighted by something other than market capitalization. So, we are seeing a great deal of interest in it and I think now advisors and advisory firms, investment committees they’re making evaluations between different smart data approaches and their we are competing against equal weighted strategies to some extent low volatility strategies and other fundamental related strategies. So I think from the way WisdomTree is positioning ourselves is one we have a track record that seven or eight years now – a very impressive performance relative to traditional cap weighted index. Number two, our indexes have tremendous investment capacity inside of that because their design to scale for the size of the company that doesn’t necessarily apply you can see weighted indexes and put some limits on how widely adopted they could become. And number three, our indexes have done a very good job of getting the line share of the markets upside capture over the last five years. That’s not necessarily true of low volatility strategies they tend to only get traction of the markets upside. And at the end of the day, what really matters to investors is what was a return you got and how much risk of did you take to get it? That’s where we are trying to focus people retention on because that’s what we think WisdomTree is the greatest competitive advantage."
Stephen Jones,Jonathan Steinberg," Thank you, that’s very helpful."," With respect a few pressure, the smart beta products are priced at some of them are priced cheaper and some of them more expensive. So at the end of the day its really the delivery of the funds return after fee, after transaction cost and their again, we think we have a competitive advantage."
Stephen Jones,Jonathan Steinberg," Great, thanks. And sort of on the fixed income side of the products that how is the build out going there. And maybe you could speak to sort of that current rate environments and what it’s going take to get more traction, more broadly with our fixed income ETFs industry?","Well, with respects to WisdomTree what it would take it would take interest rates to starts rising both the United States and Japan. Any kind of rise in the market rate or any kind of Federal Reserve interest rate hike, would impact the bullish for our products that because they are designed to work in that market environment. We had good success with emerging market debt ETFs for the first few years after they were launched, but the center mid changed in year over the last 18 months that starting to subside now and we’re starting to see potentially a back into some EM equity classes. So we think our EM debt fund, which doesn’t have currency risk on the currency side should start to appeal to advisors going forward and hopefully it will be growing interest to get in the local debt EM space, which has been sold off of the last year."
Macrae Sykes,Luciano Siracusano," Good morning gentlemen. I would ask two questions and maybe you could answer them together. First is on Europe and how do you see the distribution unfolding? Are you talking mainly institutions, retails and combination of both, I mean, secondarily what are this some of the difference in ETFs adoption in Europe versus US. Other some nuances and what your thoughts on more competitive? Thanks"," Hi, this is Luciano again. So, with respect to the roll out of product and distribution strategy in Europe, we are going to discuss that more as you get closer to it and so I want to comment on specifically today except to say that in Europe it’s a very fragmented market there are ETF assets in the UK there are ETF assets in Germany and also in Switzerland. So you need to know who are the ETF users and then you need to figure out a way to talk to them and get them interested and what was and through does even figure out how to work it into their practice. And the good news in Europe is that they are starting to move to more of the fee-based model, we are advising to being discourage during in certain cases prohibited on from doing business the way they used in terms of sales loads and so forth. So we think the overall climate is becoming more conducive for low fee-product and that’s one of the reasons on we’re going in to Europe now."
Adam Beatty,Amit Muni," Thank you, and good morning. First a couple of questions about WisdomTree Europe and the cost around that you took some expenses in the quarter just for integration and what have you, apart from the operating loss of boost and WisdomTree Europe will there be any sort of additional investment expenses. And then the second part of that question is in terms of the, kind of charge off of the acquisition cost obviously there is a future point in time, where the AUM in the multiple and what have you will be fixed. Will there be sort of periodic trips in charging off that cost? Thanks.","Hi, Adam. So we think, so there is beyond this, so we put in $20 million working capital into the business within the WisdomTree Europe. And we think that’s enough capital of the business needs to get the break even at the end of full year. So, there’s not going to be any investments are beyond that, that’s the plan today. And then we expect that’s burn it up $4 to $6 million in the first year by 2014 and $6 million to $9 million next year. As we continue to ramp up the business, as we continue to non-small funds we expect that loss so it’s quite a little bit in the third year and then gets a break even in the fourth year. So, this is the control build up that we’re doing over that full years. So at the end of the full year, we have a commitment to buy out the remaining 25%. So what you’re going to see in our second quarter results is that will take a charge of what we believe the future payout will be based on the assets at the time at June 30. And then every quarter we are just going to basically true that up over the next four years you’ll see that charge start to grow as the assets continue to grow into that business."
Adam Beatty,Amit Muni," Okay. That’s helpful, thanks, Amit. Maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier discussion around DXJ, could you give us any color on, how you see – you talk about the use of the product. How do you see the investor composition is that primarily institutional, primarily retail what kind of intelligent do you have around that?"," Well. DXJ represents about a third of our AUM, so its been adopted across all the major channels, I would say that it does have a lot of international interest it’s a global security. And so when we take look at the outflows in the first quarter, the largest outflows we can identify were facility that typical and institutional. And so their may have been some international redemption of DXJ in the first quarter, and again its very widely held across the major channels."
Adam Beatty,Amit Muni," Okay. That’s helpful, thanks. Then one last one, thanks for taking my questions. Just around the in visor channel may be in the context of, some of the comments around Europe, but also here in the U.S. in terms of advisors billing more on UN as opposed to training commissions and what have you, what in – and do you feel we’re in, I guess mainly in the U.S. in terms of ETF penetration and the attractiveness of world fee product in that context? Thanks.","I’d say the U.S. is obviously ahead of Europe and we’ve seen tremendous adoption in the U.S. is started in the RIA channel, I think over the last 10 years we’ve seen more adoption in the warehouse channel as advisors move to fee-based advisory platform. I think that’s good for the advisor, I think, its goods for the plan, I also think it’s good for the overall firm. I wouldn’t put a feeling on it. All I would say is that it’s continuing to gain traction and it still I think relatively early both in the ETF adoption cycle and in terms of practice management I think that would be going forward I think you’ll see more advisory assets falling in then commission based assets in the future."
Chris C. Shutler,Luciano Siracusano,"Hi, guys good morning. You highlighted emerging markets is one of the drivers in Q1 of the outflows couple of quick questions there, to the extent you can tell what channel though the outflows concentrated in. And then secondly to what extent at least in the near term do you think investors are gravitating more towards active manager per EM?"," Well, this is Luciano. With respect to your question we still one redemption in our Brazilian currency fund that was a large RA firm, which accounted for almost all of the currency. EM equity as you mentioned has been out of favor so we did see redemption is there pretty much across the board in terms of the channels. With respect to active there are periods when some active managers do a little bit better than the indexes, but over a longer period of time, I think the data is pretty overwhelming that, due to the capacitive approach is better. And certainly we compare our emerging market strategies to active managers and we do very well over longer term timeframe. So, I think everything is really was changed in terms of the strategic case where passive been exposure. I do think people are more open for different type of exposure they making from the traditional captulated benchmarks."
Chris C. Shutler,Jonathan Steinberg," Yes, it seems to be disputing. And then on the capital allocation just want to get your current thoughts and particularly any incremental thoughts around buy-back?"," So Chris, the businesses is very well, we are generating a bit amount of cash but, as I said we are growth company and our goal is to invest that money back into the business strategically to help support that growth whether its continue to organic growth or whatever is determinate, we funded our acquisition of boost. And so there is a lots of opportunity for us to use that cash. To the extent, if we have, if we believe we have excess cash beyond our investment needs for the business, we will consider returning that to investors."
Chris C. Shutler,Jonathan Steinberg," And remind me, give an outstanding authorization?"," The only buyback that we do today, we buyback the amount of when employees best in their restricted stock, we buyback the tax portion of that, that’s only buyback that would be say."
Doug Sipkin,Luciano Siracusano," Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to spend a little bit more time on Europe, it sounds like it’s a nice opportunity for you guys in a couple of years. So obviously a big source of ETF growth in U.S has been now the emergence of these ETF money managers like when haven and things like that. Where are we in Europe and maybe seeing the development of money manger’s like that I know it’s probably early days there that you guys eluded to the migration to the fee-based is still way behind where we are, but I’m just curious if you’re seeing the emergence of sort of new development of an ETF money manager universe in Europe?","Hi, this is Luciano. I think what we see it in Europe is on the mutual fund side and in the institutional asset management side. So there we are seeing folks use EFTs within broader allocations either in a mutual fund, mutual structure an institutional account. I don’t think they are at the point yet of having enough within a RIA channel develop to have what we would consider RIA money managers I think that’s a driver in the future. But as they move to fee-based approaches and that would be natural evolution as that advisors start to get digression over the several $100 million about the fee-based approach the nature next step is to create a model that they can use implementing ETFs and then try to raise money within ETF model I mean that’s been very successful in the U.S. it’s a major drivers of assets in America and we had a lot of success working with those RIA firms finding a place in those model."
Doug Sipkin,Jonathan Steinberg, Great. So if I sort of think about the opportunity in Europe it sounds like it’s probably going to come more from traditional guys just embracing ETFs more than they have in the past in terms of slow generation over the next couple of years because it’s still probably early days for those RIA models?," I think that’s a fair assessment, I mean the Europe is the second largest ETF market in the world, but it is still many, many years behind the U.S. and its build out. And, particularly on the business model and advisors it is still early days, but they had been important legislation that is encouraging sort of this fee-based movement."
Doug Sipkin,Jonathan Steinberg," Gotcha, okay. And then just some financial questions so obviously you guys pass the threshold and will be recording a GAAP tax rate, but still not paying taxes for sometime obviously still getting a bit benefit from the shield. I’m just wondering to reflect this I mean is there a certain AUM level were maybe dividend come into play, I know we’re not there yet. It sounds like I think that guys have said you would probably more incline to pay a dividend then play buybacks, I mean there is certain AUM level down the road where maybe that comes a little bit more into play and again that would be maybe better shows of the tax advantages you still have?"," Yes, Doug if I wouldn’t say it is tied really to AUM it’s really tied to our investment needs. We are growth company, we want to make the right investment to the business that support our growth on that where our key focus is we spent, we believe, we have excess cash beyond those investments need. We would considerably showing that back to investors we check primarily we favor dividend as we are going to do that but the key is not that AUM level that it’s very dissolving factor is as we believe we have excess cash beyond our investment need opportunities."
Doug Sipkin,Jonathan Steinberg," Gotcha, okay that’s helpful. And then just finally with the guidance around boost those numbers net or did you actually be able to get tax benefit from those early development loses?"," Those are our pretax numbers there and the business are getting the biggest generate losses right and so – those you’ll see some benefit on that’s kind of effective tax rates from that, but they are small and big scheme of things anyway."
John Dunn,Luciano Siracusano," Good morning. I had a follow-up on the competitive landscape. Could you give us an update on and you talked about a smart beta building, but specifically on the nontransparent ETFs and some of the large ETF guys ramping up in your signature, some of your signature product?"," So with respect to nontransparent, I think you will need to attract a new ETF buyer from who was in the market today. The market in the U.S. that has been buying ETF’s likes the full functionality, which includes the full transparency. So personally I’m not that optimistic about nontransparent active, but that’s what making horse race."
John Dunn,Amit Muni," Gotcha. And then, maybe just give a flavor of the sales discussions for some of your newer vintage products, particularly the once that are designd to address rising rate?","Sure. So we’ve been speaking to RAs and institutional investors, as well as some advisors who are all on platform that can use these strategies. In fact, we’re going to have some advisors in about two weeks from across the country, as well as advisory firms. And this would be one of the discussions we will be going through with them, how to use an effective interest rate hedge portfolios to manage interest rates risks in the future going forward. What we have heard from clients is, when we launched this in the beginning of the year, the 10-year bond was about 3%, it got down to below 2.7%. So this is not a concern that’s front and center for them today, but it is something that they feel they are going to manage and deal within the coming year, next two or three years. So we feel the suite of products we launched as well as the floating rate treasury product will be well suited for clients to use once we see the federal reserve raising interest rates and market rates going up. But that might be 12 months, 18 months out. So I would say, we’re very early on the education cycle, but we are getting the word out to these products exist and they are developing a decent track record in the interim."
William R. Katz –– Citigroup Global Markets,Amit Muni," Okay. Thanks for taking these extra questions. I’m not sure these are related questions, but I’ll ask them together. Could you give us an update on what you are seeing in terms of opportunity set into the retirement business, particularly into United States? Then more broadly what are you seeing if adding in terms of any pricing pressure for the industry a large?","Well, with respect to 401(k) retirement, I mean there have been some advances forward there. We think that overall, we think record keepers across the country are going to come under some competitive pressure to have an ETF enabled offering both to get more investment choice in the system, as well as to get overall fees down. So we would hope that over the coming years, more opportunities open up on the record-keeping side. We’re also working with the RAAs who sell into these platforms to get WisdomTree ETFs inside of their models. So as those money managers get wired in effect to get inside this 401(k) distribution plans, that would be a potential driver for WisdomTree."
