Chad Messer,Gerard Michel," Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another good quarter. Appreciate the added color that you gave on expenses both margins and where SG&A and R&D can go. Is it possible maybe to expand on that a little bit more? Is there some rule of thumb for a sales force expansion, I know you expanded it in the past. Is that a good sort of rule of thumb to look at how cost went up before as you expanded the sales force as you're doing it again?"," Hey Chad, it’s Gerard. I think for the sales force itself, yes that's a good rule of thumb. However, we are putting additional investment in hub services to really smooth the process of a patient from the doctor deciding that they want some MACI implant to getting insurance approval, so it will be a bit higher than when you saw in the past and that's why we gave a fairly specific numbers saying, hey, I think what we did this quarter and over a couple quarters ramp it up until we get about $2 million higher a quarter. That would pay perform within the sales force and the bulk of that is from the hub services."
Chad Messer,Gerard Michel," Okay. I appreciate that. And then you had basically no net cash used or at least the cash balance didn't go down during the quarter even though you've got this – accounts receivable was there debt drawdown or share issuances, what accounts for you guys…"," We did have a judicious use of the ATM. We issued approximately 1.9 million shares for approximately $6.9 million net cash. We think we're in pretty good shape with the current tools in hand to get the profitability and that’s part of the reason we went through all that detail about the AR, DSO and ICT et cetera."
Kevin DeGeeter,Dominick Colangelo," Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to trends you're seeing in the markets for MACI, one of your peers did complete enrollment in clinical trial back over the summer. Have you seen any impact in certain centers with regard to patients who might have otherwise gone and clinical trial being now candidates for commercial sale of MACI?"," Well Kevin, I don't think we've seen a meaningful increase due to that if you think about it our competitors made it be enrolling single-digit numbers of patients a month, so it really doesn't have a huge impact for us. We are just pleased, obviously generally that we're seeing increased utilization across the board whether they were investigators and other studies or not."
Kevin DeGeeter,Gerard Michel," And with regard to your comments in the prepared portion of the call with regard to gross margin, can you just help us think how mix may impact expansion of gross margin going forward specifically that kind of call $0.80, $0.85 per $100 of kind of for us profit. How does that sort of fall depending over there that's Epicel versus MACI revenue following through?"," Yes. That’s a great question. I think the percentages I gave really are based on our anticipated mix. I think on the margin if Epicel is growing by leaps and bounds and continue to grow by leaps and bounds and superseded took over MACI. I think maybe it might be a tad bit lower, but I think it's within the margin of error. The material cost for these per patient are roughly similar."
Kevin DeGeeter,Dominick Colangelo, Okay. And then lastly for me and then I'll get back in the queue. With regard to sales force expansion is 40 sort of the right number now that you have essentially full access in payor coverage and how should we think about the trend in potential sales force growth going forward to the extent the demand continues to pull through?," Yes. Thanks Kevin, it's Nick. For the time being, we do think it's the right number. As Dan mentioned, there were a couple drivers, one is that with increased expanded medical policies, it opened up some geographies where we didn't have good Carticel coverage in the past, so that was sort of an easy one. And then as you think about a sales force expansion, obviously there's a larger universe of orthopedic surgeons that we would like to reach with the appropriate frequency and making sure we can do that in light of increasing workloads being driven by increased by biopsies implants et cetera. So it's a combination of all of those factors, increased medical policy better region frequency on our target universe, and making sure that we can do count the work activity for our sales reps."
Kevin DeGeeter,Dominick Colangelo," Maybe just one more quick follow-up question with regard to your comments on extended coverage for orthopedic surgeon. When you think about some of them are kind of call them mid-tier orthopedic surgeons by volume, sort of what’s the lower bound or how many cases given orthopedic surgeon needs to be seeing a month for to makes sense to allocate a MACI rep to be calling of them?"," Yes, I don't know that we can answer the exact number of like cartilage repair that they do on a monthly basis. It's more about seeing the right mix of patients, our typical patient is 35 years old or typical physician is more sports injury associated and so I would say that the typical threshold for a physician if somebody can treat at least two of these patients annually, and from that they'll get biopsies, say from twice that number, two to three times that number of potential patients. So that is like – it's a continuous pool of patients that physician creates or thinking of the appropriate patient and applying MACI where [they tried] and typically that would be the lower threshold."
Ted Tenthoff,Dominick Colangelo," Great, thank you very much. Can you hear me okay?", Yes.
Ted Tenthoff,Dominick Colangelo," Good, so very nice quarter and again the MACI launchings to be doing particularly well. Just looking kind of down the road maybe a couple years, ultimately how big do you think this product can get and is just something where you would have to expand manufacturing at some point?"," Yes, Ted, I’ll start as we talk about often in our corporate presentation and as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, we think we are probably penetrating maybe 10% of the patients that we believe could benefit from MACI annually. So we think there's just a kind of upside for this product as we continue to build the brand over the foreseeable future. In terms of manufacturing capacity as Dan alluded to, we had a much larger footprint from a clean room perspective for Carticel and we had a separate MACI suite and once we removed Carticel from the market in the middle of this year, Dan and his team have embarked on converting part of the Carticel clean room over to MACI cell. We don't have any real estate constraints that we need to expand beyond that again. We're certain to be able to do that. So for us it's more about getting the certain volume levels. We may have to add some headcount at some point down the line, but there's no real estate constraint for us in terms of projected volumes into the future."
