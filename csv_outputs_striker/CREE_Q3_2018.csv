Joseph Osha,Gregg Lowe," Thank you and hello, my complements. On the – looking at the silicon carbide business I'm wondering what kind of lead times you have for tools at this point if you were to decide that you wanted to add even more capacity for example, how long would it take for that to filter through the process? Thank you."," We are – we're in the midst of ramping that, the silicon growth capability right now, doubling that capacity by the year end and that is going exceptionally well. The one thing Joe, just to remind everybody, you know, it's not like we can go down the street and buy the tools. A lot of these tools are kind of we're getting piece parts and we build them basically ourselves. So it's a very proprietary process. And there is some limit in terms of the speed of brining these things up online. We're c currently on track right now to continue to grow the capacity as planned and we're anticipating that we'll continue growing that capacity next year. In terms of lead time, Mike you want to add a couple?"
Joseph Osha,Mike McDevitt," Thank you and just as a quick followup Mike for you, would you, where you planning on sharing some of the divisional gross margin contributions to that 40% number that we heard about?", For the long range goals?
Joseph Osha,Mike McDevitt, That's correct.," Yes, our intent is to continue, like we lined out at the Investor Day is that Wolfspeed would be the margin leader and that would be approximating over the long haul call it in the 50 percent range and then both the Lighting and the LED businesses would be in the low 30s."
Brian Lee,Gregg Lowe," Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. First one was just on the Infineon acquisition. I appreciate you breaking out what was organic and nonorganic in Q3, just wondering can you give us a sense for the revenue contribution you are expecting for Infineon in Q4. It just seems like you were implying about $30 million dollars full quarter contribution based on the run rate you guys described at the time of acquisition, but maybe there is some seasonality or timing issues. If Wolfspeed is set to grow organically into fiscal Q4 it would imply the Infineon pickup is doing a much lower run rate than that. So wondering how we could reconcile? Thanks."," Yes Brian, I'll start off and then Mike will give you a little bit more detail. The biggest impact is the impact of the restriction of selling to ZTE. We normally don't break out customer percentages specifically, but I think in this case it probably is helpful. So ZTE was a large customer approximately 20% of the revenue from the Infineon Power business, so obviously not being able to ship to them created a headwind."
Brian Lee,Mike McDevitt," Okay, all right, that's helpful. I'll followup offline with some follow-ups there. Just on the margins quickly Mike, the consolidated margins at 29/7 I suppose is the LED flat and Wolfspeed down a snitch, it would imply lighting is going to be up another probably 300 basis points sequentially, is that kind of a fair math or is there something that maybe I am missing in the margin walk? Thank you."," Yes, what we would be kind targeting is a couple 100 basis point improvement sequentially on Lighting."
Paul Coster,Mike McDevitt," Yes thanks for taking my question. Mike, you mentioned the product mix might weigh on the Wolfspeed margins, but I may have confused that with the ZTE comments. Is it one and the same?"," So, two pieces to it. So the first part is the RF Power business that we bought is component packaging, so it has lower systemic margin than our broader Wolfspeed portfolio, but still accretive to Cree overall. And so that's one part of it and then the second part is we do have some factory unloading just with not being able to make and ship ZTE parts."
Paul Coster,Raiford Garrabrant," Okay and then a quick followup, the largest EV market in the world will probably be China right, at least unit volume wise and I'm wondering are you already selling into that market you know trade relationships and how does this tried just few plan for that? Thank you."," Hey, Paul it's Raiford, yes we're selling into the EV market around the world and we don't break out the number of design wins we have here or there, but we've seen generally speaking an acceleration and activity from design wins to road map discussions, capacity discussions with OEMs and tier ones around the world and would like to continue to assess with what the U.S. TR is doing and fully understand the potential impact of our customers, but that said, we believe the intent is not to punish U.S. companies and hope we get a decision that doesn't hurt Cree."
Jeff Osborne,Gregg Lowe," Yes, good afternoon. Just two quick ones on the acquired Infineon business, I was curious if you could share just roughly what percentage of the packages you're making are silicon based versus silicon carbide and then as you move to more silicon carbide over time which I assume is the strategy and using your own materials would have in some margins as that progresses? And then the other question…?"," Yes, I would say most of the business is traditional silicon LDMOS technology today and we certainly bought it with the intent to capitalize on our position with gallium nitride. So obviously we will be transitioning that business based on the demand for more bandwidth at 4G and then the near necessity for gallium nitride with five G base station. So we would anticipate that that business would migrate from predominantly an LDMOS silicon based capability to a predominately GaN based capability. As we and we certainly anticipate that we'd be able to make gross margins go up as we make that transition."
Jeff Osborne,Mike McDevitt, Got it and is there any thought in and possibly giving some context as to the mix within Wolfspeed as it relates to materials RF and Power is there is there any color that you can provide on that?, I think at this time we're not contemplating breaking it out that specifically. We think it's better and more representative just to talk about the overall haul of the business.
Harsh Kumar,Gregg Lowe," Yes, hey guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Gregg, I was curious off the market you mention for silicon carbide which one do you see as the fastest grower in the near to midterm and then I have a follow up?"," Well, I think certainly mid-to-long term the largest market is for sure the electric vehicle market. It's got a huge amount of potential. I would also say that even in the near term that's driving a lot of the activity as well. Just the efficiency improvements that you get, the power density and capability that you get really aligns nicely with what people are looking for in terms of electric vehicle. It helps car manufacturers either reduce the amount of batteries they use for a certain amount of range or increase the amount of range they get for certain amount of battery. And so and those are those are things that are high on the list of people buying an electric vehicle. So I think that's really the driver. The good news is that we've got a lot other sort of lines in the water if you will and we've got a lot of interest in solar and industrial and so forth and so with the new sales team coming onboard, trying to expand that footprint is an additional objective we have."
Harsh Kumar,Gregg Lowe," And then Gregg for my follow up, I'm not sure if you mentioned, but the $15 million OpEx reduction in Lighting when do you complete that and when can we start to think of modeling that into our models?"," So we're rolling out that plan as we speak, so we expect to have it fully implemented within the September 2018 quarter, so our Q1 of our fiscal '19 and then coming out of that quarter is when you can expect that we have had that fully baked in. I guess the only thing I'd like to put out there for the long models is some of those savings we may choose to reinvest into Wolfspeed and funneling that growth as well so…"
Edwin Mok,Gregg Lowe," Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats for a good quarter. So the first question I have on the, I guess on the competition side on the silicon carbide material market, given the growing demand and you guys have added capacity, have you seen your competitor add any capacity and some of those device manufacturers actually was at the wafering capacity, have you seen of those captive guys also adding capacities?"," Well I’ll start with may be wafer and can add a few comments and so forth. There is a tremendous amount of demand and we're certainly engaged with a lot of customers at this point. And what I would say is, the customers are pretty impressed when they come on campus and they see a whole bunch of cranes around here expanding the capacity and they also see that we've got a tremendous technology base. Our ability to ramp this capacity so far has been demonstrated to be very, very solid. The $100 million, the greater than $100 million supply agreement that we inked last quarter I think is a good indication of that. And what I would tell you is, the amount of discussions that we're having right now relative to how do our customers get more capacity and how do they secure more capacity, the amount of those discussions has simply increased over the period of time."
Edwin Mok,Gregg Lowe," Okay, great that’s helpful clarifying that. And then I guess on the Infineon acquisition, I just, call it longer term question I guess, now that you guys bought the business you have some deals or have better insight into how the packaging facility is working right? Is there a way to kind of think about how much that will benefit your margins long term in terms of driving or improving your margins now that you’re patching in-house and do you see a need long term to invest in that capacity to increase packaging facility to support your business growth?"," So a couple of things, I would say that we're now two months into owning this operation, so we're kind of at the early stage. It's a great team. It's a great leadership team. It's an incredible engineering workforce. It's great operations team. So we're really excited about that. The factory they have is highly automated factory. At this point it's underutilized and obviously the ZTE situation hurts that. So we certainly have an ability to grow that capacity. I think in terms of margin, as we transition the business from a silicon LDMOS to more of a gallium nitride or GaN business it will certainly be incremental, it will be increases in gross margin and it will certainly be substantially accretive to Cree’s overall business. So we feel real good about that. We also see that, those are, we've got a nice growth trajectory ahead of us that is the demand for bandwidth continues to be high and the transition towards 5G being sort of GaN is kind of in the sweetspot of that transition. So overall I feel really good about it. I mean, it's a bummer. We started off the same with a ban on selling to one of our bigger customers. I think that's certainly a short term headwind, but like I said it doesn't change the strategic rationale around what we're doing and we're really excited about the potential."
Daniel Baksht,Gregg Lowe," Hi, thanks. Could you talk about how you're targeting a sequential improvement in LED products for both revenue and gross margin in light of some reallocate this capacity to Wolfspeed, is the growth mix related or JV related? Thanks."," So as I mentioned in my comments we've got some good demand in our high power products, so we're expecting good growth sequentially in the quarter and then some modest growth in the JV. Actually our target for gross margin is similar to last quarter, so kind of staying level with that but getting good demand growth. And right now in the near term with what we've seen, backlog is in a good position as we started this quarter versus last quarter and the same period a year ago. So at least in the near term we're winning in those high power general lighting, video screen, and specialty lighting applications."
Daniel Baksht,Mike McDevitt," Okay, great. Thanks and then on CapEx you previously mention you'd spent less year-over-year in 2019. Now that the 2018 CapEx is $190 million this year if I heard that right, does that statement about 2019 CapEx will stand? Thanks."," Yes, and just think of it as the 190, the effort that we're undertaking that originally lined with the 220 is still the same effort. It is the at the timing of the cash outflow. So all the plans on what we're initiating in projects and that is still in line with plan, so FY19s targets that we kind of talked macro about at the Investor Day are still in place."
Craig Irwin,Gregg Lowe," Good Evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So Gregg, there is a fairly lively conversation out there among all the customers of your silicon carbide wafers. A lot of them have opinions about where wafer prices need to ahead to unlock the multi-billion dollar TAM that we're looking at where, investors are looking at to make Cree attractive over the next number years. Can you maybe share with us your thoughts on pricing strategy for wafers, whether or not you believe some of the more aggressive prices that your customers are hoping for whether you believe those are necessary and any other color that you think we should factor as far as, what else supports sustained gross margins on the wafer side over the next few years?"," Well, Craig we certainly are very much active in terms of driving the cost of our silicon carbide technology down over the time period and part of this combining our operations with the get better efficiency out of the manufacturing operations as well. In the early stages of looking at what those numbers might be, but we're obviously attacking that pretty vigorously. It's interesting right now, if you take a look at the cost of silicon versus silicon carbide and you’re kind of integrated with the efficiency gains that you get out of it, there is good reason why people are moving towards silicon carbide. If you add to that then and pretty good intensive cost programs that we're working on inside the business, I think it's just that that cost value analysis thing is just going to get a lot better. So, it's obviously something that we're working on. I'm not going to share any numbers right now. But we're not just standing still saying, wow this is a really great market and let's just say where we're at. We know that if we continue driving costs down that it will drive the demand for silicon carbide up and it will expand the SAM [ph] if you will for the use of silicon carbide and that's absolutely what the intention is. So lot of very hard work going on right now at a company that's focused on driving costs down."
Craig Irwin,Gregg Lowe," Good to hear. So my followup question is on the license agreement with Nexperia, GaN on silicon, GaN on silicon carbide, it's really nice to see Cree pulling in other participants into this market, helping create additional customers. Can you maybe give us color on whether or not you'd expect to pull in other silicon carbide producers potentially. In the future, should we see similar licenses to other GaN power check producers, would you expect this to take similar momentum to what Cree achieved in the Lighting business maybe licensing some if its technology for fixtures and chips over the last many years?"," Well, I think Craig the approach that we've had on silicon carbide is really having a materials business that works with other folks out there. We inked the greater than $100 million deal with Infineon exactly for that purpose. So we are absolutely of that same mindset that there is a real opportunity for us to take, what I think is kind of a tipping point if you will in the silicon to silicon carbide movement and really expand that pretty substantially. So yes, we're absolutely doing that. I think the GaN licensing deal with Nexperia was sort of a separate thought process, but I think as it relates to silicon carbide, we're working with a lot of folks to try to make silicon carbide the technology of choice for the power electronics industry."
Craig Irwin,Gregg Lowe," Great, thanks again for taking my questions.", Thank you.
Colin Rusch,Gregg Lowe," Thanks so much and then sawing on that, just thinking about the long term customer interest and the product mix interest from the automotive customers, can you talk a little bit about how many of those were actually getting wafer supply and how many of them are looking at the devices that you guys are selling?"," I think it's a combination. As we've talked about the reason we're expanding the capacity for both our materials capacity, sales to third parties as well as the wafer fab and the ability to make power devices. For these reasons we're having discussions with automotive companies and Tier ones globally who are interested and we're having conversations with device makers who are having similar conversations and either source of supply. So what we're seeing the reason we're making the significant investments we are the reason you're seeing the business growth is because we're participating in both ways."
Colin Rusch,Gregg Lowe," And can you talk a little bit about the lumpiness potentially of gross margins as you ramp capacity, how much strength do you expect as you bring some of the capacity up?"," You know, that's hard to model. What I would tell you, I've been through a lot of capacity ramps and there's always you know it seems like the crisis of the day and that is very normal. What I would tell you, I was very impressed with the Cree manufacturing and engineering operations. This past quarter we faced a couple of challenges. We were able to get a team together. We picked some and so forth. I think by and large that great teamwork and cooperation across the organization and will allow us to result most of these things going forward, but they'll be some issues going forward. I don't anticipate it anything big. I'm not trying to foreshadow anything big. I'm just saying it's very normal that as you're ramping capacity like we are that something is going to come up and we're going to have to put a team together and the good news is the team really did a great job of executing this past quarter."
