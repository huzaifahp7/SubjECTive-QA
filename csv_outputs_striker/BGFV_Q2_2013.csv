David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller," I just had 2 questions. One is, what is your assumption for the second half with regard to the ticket size? Do you expect further improvement there?"," Well, we look for our ticket to continue to trend positively, it has now really for a number of quarters. We think that the ticket continues to benefit from our shift to some more branded products and step up to higher price points."
David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller," Is there more work to be done because I know you're sort of lapping in the period last year, which is, again, a bit of a master strategy. Is there a meaningful change in the mix this year versus last with regard to the price points?"," Well, it continues to be a work in progress. I do believe there is more work to be done. We're still consistently evaluating our product offering and looking to make improvements on an ongoing basis, certainly."
David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller," And then, secondly, the environment out there, I think, is certainly been a positive factor so far this year. Do you sense any change with that? Or does that continue to be sort of a secondary positive factor for you guys in terms of comps ability?"," I'm not sure what -- when you say the environment, are you saying the economic environment? The weather environment? The competitive environment?"
David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller, The pace of macroeconomic recovery out there.," Yes, we think it's been generally positive. I think there's still lots of issues that remain in some of our markets and particularly in California. But I think the year-over-year improvement has been positive. We still believe there's a segment of our consumer base that is affected by issues of payroll tax and unemployment benefits running out and the like, but overall, we see the environment being recently stable and hopefully getting better."
Sean P. McGowan,Steven G. Miller," I also have a couple of questions. I'm going to start with any comments you might offer about the ammunition supply chain, it's been something that's come up on recent calls. Do we take it from the fact you didn't comment on it that it's gotten a lot better?"," Well, I think there's still some issues in terms of the supply chain. I think it has gotten better, but we're still not receiving all the ammunition, all the calibers that we would like to see in the quantities we would -- ideally our consumers would like to see them."
Sean P. McGowan,Steven G. Miller, But you don't think it's having a big effect on your ability to register those sales?," Well, yes, the ammunition business still remains very healthy for us."
Sean P. McGowan,Barry D. Emerson," Okay, good. Barry, would you mind repeating what's the net per share effect of the closings and impairment in the second quarter? And then, any comment you would have on the balance of the year? And I have a follow-up question on that for either one of you two."," The net per share effect of what, Sean?"
Sean P. McGowan,Barry D. Emerson, Of closings and impairment.," Last year? Okay. Well, okay. I mean, so last year included $0.02 a share of impairment charges. It also included -- I'm sorry, let me -- $700,000, plus or minus, of store closing costs, $0.02 a share, as well as $200,000 of impairment costs, about $0.01 a share. So a total of $0.03, Sean."
Sean P. McGowan,Steven G. Miller," Okay. And the follow-up question on that is, as your business improves, and you make merchandise changes, product selection changes that improve things, do you think that kind of raises the bar on what performance you expect from some of the stores? And might we expect to see maybe more closings as a result of some of them doing better? Or is that not the right way to look at it?"," Yes, I don't think that's the right way to look at it. I think the changes that we've made are fundamentally helping, we think, virtually. All of our stores, generally, have been positive -- positive across the board, so I don't see any thought that the initiatives or changes that we're making would create any more pressures to close stores that existed in the past. We always evaluate our store base and -- but we feel very good about the change we are making, fundamentally benefiting all of our stores."
William J. Dezellem,Steven G. Miller," A couple of questions that are potentially related. I believe in the opening remarks, you mentioned that you were less promotional in the second quarter, and then, in the press release, there was a reference to your marketing strategies to broaden your appeal to the customer. Would you discuss both of those? And if they are directly related together, link them. And if not, you can just take them as separate questions, please?"," Okay. I mean, we can adjust them to the manner which we market gives us the flexibilities to change some of the levels of our promotions on a pretty timely basis, depending on the conditions of the business, the tick of the business and the environmental issues. So given how the business was trending in the second quarter, we backed off some promotional activity that -- comping against some promotional activity from the prior year. And that's something that we evaluate, and always have, on a very ongoing basis."
William J. Dezellem,Steven G. Miller," And so, that -- when you reference the new marketing strategies with the focus on broadening your appeal, it's really talking about a shift from print to digital?"," Well, the broadening appeal is in conjunction with the merchandise initiatives. So when we talk about, I guess, the use of language of broadening our appeal, that more references the type of products that we carry in our stores versus a means of marketing those products."
William J. Dezellem,Steven G. Miller," That's helpful. And then, relative to the lower promotional activity in the second quarter, does that in any way help explain the higher gross margin in Q2 versus Q1 even though -- and I recognize it's not normally a comparison, but even though the second quarter sales were slightly below the first quarter sales?"," Bill, again, I think you're -- I think these -- they're very, very challenging to compare the first quarter to the second quarter, the seasons are just dramatic with the winter impact on the first quarter. So clearly this year, though, the mix impacted the margins, as well as the lower promotion activity for the quarter, year-over-year."
Adam F. Engebretson,Steven G. Miller, Maybe a first question on Q2 traffic. Did the pace of traffic during the quarter follow your pace of sales?," It's recently consistent. I mean, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that if you factor out some of the calendar shifts with Easter and 4th of July, our sales were -- trending was really remarkably consistent throughout the period and the traffic, and relationship between traffic and ticket was equally consistent."
Adam F. Engebretson,Steven G. Miller," Okay. And then, maybe clarification. On the quarter-to-date trends, did you say that those were tracking positive? And if so, would that employ -- imply that the quarter-to-date comps were also positive?"," Well, I said that they were off to a solid start, and you can -- a takeaway from that is that yes, they are tracking positive and quarter-to-date trends are positive and certainly consistent with the guidance that we provided for the entire quarter."
Adam F. Engebretson,Steven G. Miller," Okay. And maybe lastly, on the remodel program. Have those stores been open or kind of been -- is there a long of history there to gauge kind of how those are doing after the remodel? Or is it still too early in that program to say?"," It's really early. I mean, we're still in the midst of completing the remodels. Again, there are varying degrees of activity that's associated with the individual remodels, but it's very pretty immature to make a comment as to how the -- how they're benefiting the business other than to say we feel very positive about what we're doing, and we'll certainly look forward to continuing on the program."
Steven L. Martin,Steven G. Miller," Could you give us a little more specificity on the third quarter guidance because your guidance implies the smallest increase to gross margin and the smallest improvement in SG&A expense that you've had for a while? And is there something specific about this third quarter that would lead to very small improvement in gross margin? Especially when your mix -- I'm sorry, especially when your mix of apparel has been so much stronger."," Right, right. Maybe, Barry, you can add to it, but I may -- I think what shouldn't be lost is that we're comping against a very strong Q3 from last year. It was our strongest third quarter in our history, 11-year-plus history as a public company. We comped our sales, we are strong at comping up at 5.2%, we had the benefit of favorable, favorable summer weather. That certainly plays into the comparison, which I don't think should be lost in anyone."
Steven L. Martin,Barry D. Emerson, Okay. And the share count crept up a little this quarter and you didn't buy any stock back. Can you give me some color on what -- where you expect the share count to be for the next 2 quarters?," I guess, I would -- well, one, I would -- I'd run it out at the higher level. I guess I would just -- at this point, is to anticipate kind of -- I'm doing my modeling, I'm just running out the current quarter out to the balance of the year is what I would just suggest to you. I think changes, up or down, with the -- I wouldn't anticipate any of this from a modeling perspective, but even if there were, they probably wouldn't be significant. What I would say is in the -- we had an increased level of stock option exercise that occurred in the second quarter as we saw our stock price rise and so, that would attribute to the increase in the share count."
Steven L. Martin,Barry D. Emerson, Okay. And you didn't buy any stock back or make any comment about share repurchase?," Yes, that's true, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter and we'll continue to evaluate that as we always do with our board, ongoing at least quarterly."
David G. Magee,Barry D. Emerson," I just have a question regarding the e-commerce business, that you will have up and running next year. Can you talk a little bit about the -- what you sort of envision as the ultimate profitability of that business? And whether there is a risk of cannibalization as well?"," Did you say the ultimate profitability, David?"
David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller," Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Relative to the stores."," We're certainly doing this in the belief that they'll be accretive to the profitability of the business. I think it's premature to try to quantify that. We think we're approaching at an intelligent fashion. We roll out in a manner that ultimately will lead to positive sales, accretive to sales without meaningful cannibalization to the business, and hopefully, we'll like creating an omni-channel, multiple ways for our consumers to interact with us, and it will be positive to our same-store sales."
David G. Magee,Steven G. Miller, Are you getting a lot of requests right now from consumers that wish to use that channel with you guys?," We certainly do, absolutely. No question."
William J. Dezellem,Steven G. Miller," I want to circle back to the product support -- product assortment aspect of the merchandising strategy. And just that, that evolution of the product assortment. Where would you say that you are at in that process? And is there a specific timeframe that you hope to get to some, I'll call it a soft endpoint as supposed to a true endpoint?"," Bill, it's really an ongoing effort. And there's certainly no end date. I mean, we've been evolving and refining our product assortments for 58 years, as long as we've been in business. So there's never a point where we're going to sit and just say, project over. We now got the absolute ideal product assortments in our stores. I mean, we continue to learn, not every at bat is a base hit or a home run, and fundamental way we driven the business for really forever, is to try to evaluate what's working, to weed out the least productive aspects of our merchandise mix and take shots and strategic shots to generally improve the assortments. So we certainly never see an end date. I think what's been -- more of what we -- more point of weight is our efforts just to step up price points, to recognize certain changes in the consumer -- consumer behavior and ability to spend discretionary dollars, and yes, we look for that again to be an ongoing effort with certainly no end date in mind. Ultimately, we're just looking, as we always have, to provide our customers with what we think is the optimal mix of value selection, service, along with the convenience that we provide."
William J. Dezellem,Steven G. Miller," And then, it would be our sense that you felt as though you were playing catch-up, maybe, but certainly, that there was an accelerated effort, and I guess, specific to that accelerated effort or catching up process, how far along would you say you are in that?"," Well, I'm having a hard time. Again, as I said, there's no end date. We remain -- we believe very much in the middle of the game. Bottom of the fourth to top of the fifth. That's how I'd call it. I mean, it's really ongoing."
