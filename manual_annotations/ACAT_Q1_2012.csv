James Hardiman,Claude Jordan,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions here on guidance. Core ATV, you’re assuming flat to down 5% for the year. Obviously, as you mentioned, the fourth – and that’s an industry assumption – obviously, the fourth quarter was up pretty nicely and so it sounds like you’re assuming a pretty meaningful deceleration. Is that just being conservative or does that – are you seeing something so far during the first quarter that would support that?
And then I guess the flip side of that question, in terms of Snowmobiles, flat to up for the industry, I think it’s pretty straightforward what warm weather does to your ship-in patterns, but how does that affect sell-through ultimately, given how warm we finished this past snowmobile season?","All right, James. A lot of questions there. I’ll start to break them down a little bit. On the ATV side, you’re correct. Calendar year, the January, February, March that just completed, there is no doubt that the ATV industry, as I mentioned in my comments, did show some positive results. It’s the first time we’ve seen that for some time.
What I would say is as we continue to talk to dealers, as we look at the overall economy out there, we’ve not seen enough to go ahead and justify, in our opinion, that we have now hit the bottom and that ATVs are going to go ahead and turn around. So I think that the zero to down 5%, based on where it’s been over the last few years, is our best estimate as we sit here today.
On the other side of the equation, or side-by-sides, we do not provide industry data because it’s not put out by the association. But as we mentioned during my comments, we saw double-digit growth during the quarter as well as for the fiscal year last year excluding the Wildcat, and we would expect that to continue into next year or so. I think we’ll see another good year on side-by-sides and I think we’ll see it improve, but although not a great year on the ATV side of the business.
Regarding snowmobiles, our estimate now of zero to plus 2%, primarily driven by I’ll say pent up demand, we didn’t have a lot of snow in a lot of North American markets. We had good snow in certain other parts, Scandinavia, Russia and so forth. But I do think you’ll see those buyers that would have bought in January, February and March come back into the market and we’ll see a positive result of that next year.",,,,,,
James Hardiman,Claude Jordan,"Great. And then just in terms of Wildcat, can you give us any early data in terms of how sell-through has gone? And ultimately, as I think about your guidance for next year, how significant is Wildcat in that guidance? What’s sort of the year one assumptions there?","Yeah, we don’t breakout individual data on individual models. So I can’t give you a lot of detail there. The guidance that we’ve provided on the ATV business, which includes side-by-sides as well of Wildcats, we said would be up anywhere from 26% to 32%; that’s over a year that we just completed. And so when we looked at the year we just completed, ATV sales were up 25%. So up 25% the year we just completed and next year we’re saying 26% to 32%. So, overall, I’d say it’s – you can break them down into three buckets, but there’s no doubt that that’s having the biggest amount of impact of the three categories in our ATV business.
In terms of guidance, I think the guidance we’ve provided takes into consideration – the Wildcat sell-through has been going very well. But as we have mentioned before, our objective was not just take orders and ship the orders. We shipped the product. We took orders, we shipped some product and we wanted to see how retails were going and retails are going very well. So we’ve continued to go ahead and ship.
You can see in terms of overall inventory, we continue to watch that very closely. And we don’t want to go ahead and ship based on initial orders. We’d rather go ahead and see how the market’s reacting and then ship based on retails.",,,,,,
Craig Kennison,Claude Jordan,"Morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Just wanted to follow up on the guidance you issued. The ATV guidance in particular, does it only include products that you’ve already launched?","Well, I mean, obviously, we look for it the entire fiscal year 2013 and we would go ahead and consider things. I mean with the – you don’t want to go ahead and count on things that might come in, in March. But if we think we have a reasonable chance of launching new products some time during fiscal year 2013, we would include it in our numbers.",,,,,,
Craig Kennison,Claude Jordan,"Okay. That makes sense. And then on the related note, Parts, Garments and Accessories, your outlook for that business is maybe conservative, in my eyes, given the huge opportunity you have with Wildcat to sell PG&A. Can you help us unpack and sort of think through your guidance there?","Yeah, I think that there’s a good guy in there. When you look at our PG&A business, we said we’d be up 1% to 3%. The good guy being the Wildcat side of the equation. There’s no doubt that as people buy Wildcats, they will go ahead and accessorize those. And so we should see a very positive uptick on our accessories for Wildcats.
On the other side of the equitation, as we mentioned, the snow industry in retail should be up zero to 2%, but you can see our guidance in terms of shipments, down 4% to 6%. And so, with that, less accessories there. There are less people riding in the fourth quarter and we saw a drop-off in snowmobile parts. So if the dealers still have those parts, then we would’ve expected to see that a little bit soft next year as well. So you have some tradeoffs and some good guys in the Wildcat and then some negatives being impacted from the snow.",,,,,,
Craig Kennison,Claude Jordan,"Are you able to quantify the dollar impact of attachment you get with PG&A for Wildcat, if you will?","Right now I’d say, we’re only a couple of months into shipping the Wildcat, so it’s really hard to come out with an attachment rate on that just yet.",,,,,,
Craig Kennison,Claude Jordan,"Okay. And then, Claude, could you give us any comments on Europe and just the broader trends there? We’ve seen declines from other categories, but I wondered what your take is so far this spring?","Europe was a – first of all, was a very good year for us. Our entire international business was good for us and so, when you’re talking about Europe, whether it’s ATV or snow, on the snow side, they had good weather. The markets you’re talking about, Finland and Sweden, the northern markets really weren’t/aren’t as impacted as the rest of Europe, such as the southern part of Europe. And so on snow, we had a very good year.
On ATVs, we also experienced very good growth in European markets. Italy, Spain are not big countries for us. The big countries for us France, Germany and then, obviously, Norway and Sweden and countries up north are big as well. So, today, we haven’t seen any kind of impact. Last year, we saw a major pickup and I think as we look at Europe for next year, we’re being somewhat conservative in terms of what we’re expecting from them in terms of possible growth.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Tim Delmore,"Thanks, guys. Couple of questions. Do you have any commentary on April retail trend, specifically around ATVs for the industry or for your numbers?","Yeah, not – Joe, I’ll be honest, I didn’t bring the April results with us. We brought guidance for the full year. And quite honestly, I’m trying to think whether – yeah, Joe, I didn’t bring the April results with me for retails.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,"Okay, okay. And your Snowmobile, do you have orders right now from your dealers? Don’t you usually have your orders by April or so?","We do. We had our Snowmobile dealers show at the end of February, beginning of March, which is when we take orders from probably 80-some percent of our dealers and then obviously, we will get orders over the next couple of months. And so we’re just in the process now of going ahead and bringing those together and to figure out what the wholesale will be for the year. ",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,Okay. So do you – are they in line with that flat to plus 2% or is that something you don’t know yet?,"Well, the flat to plus 2% is retails. What we’ve said on guidance for Snowmobile was down 4% to down 6%.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,Okay. And the orders reflect that?,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean the guidance we’ve given, across the board, would reflect, as we sit here today, how we see fiscal year 2013.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Tim Delmore,"Okay. Sorry, I didn’t hear the down 4% to down 6%. And then your guidance about operating expenses being flat as a percentage of sales. And I think you mentioned that was your guidance for last year as well and obviously, you did much better than that. Is there a reason why we wouldn’t see leverage on that line item with growing top line? Is there something in there that will make G&A and R&D, for example, go up in line with sales, or is that just being a conservative kind of way to look at it?","Well Joe, we lose a $2 million good guy for the Canadian hedge most likely and we are investing in our R&D and sales and marketing efforts to drive new products and retail sales, so.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Tim Delmore,"Right. And the R&D number, do you have an estimate of what that should be for 2013?","Not a specific one for this call, no.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,"Right. And the R&D number, do you have an estimate of what that should be for 2013?","Hey, Joe, we’ve commented on this before, but as we’ve moved away from Suzuki, although we’ll be buying their engines through December 2013, we are doing all the R&D in-house now on the Snowmobile side for the engines.So that’s required a lot of upfront investment on our part, especially on the R&D side.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,Right. And you’ve been doing some of that through 2012 though right?,That’s correct. Yeah.,,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,"Yeah, okay. Okay. And then lastly, I think you had a comment about the inventory in the balance sheet, that that is reflective of an earlier build for Snowmobile. Did I hear that correctly?","Yeah, I think I would point to three things. First of all, the overall growth of the business in the fourth quarter, we were up 34% across the board. So that would be the one thing.
Second thing would be last year; we were building snowmobiles well into December, which is something we do not like to do. So we have moved the production date a little bit earlier there. That’s required us to go ahead and start getting some of the longer lead items such as engines in-house and last year, they would not have been on our March closing balance sheet. This year they are.
And then the third thing I would say is with our new monthly ordering system, the RPN system on the ATVs, instead of shipping a lot of products in June, because typically we’d stop in that March timeframe and ship a little bit in April and May, and then really ramp up in June, you’re seeing more of a smoother shipment pattern, so we never really slow down on the ATV and the side-by-side part of our business.",,,,,,
Rommel Dionisio,Claude Jordan,"Ah, yeah. Good afternoon. On the ATV business, with sales expected to be up well over 25% next year, are you guys bumping up against capacity constraints any time soon, just given the strong growth in that business?","Not really. When you look at where we used to be as a business and where the industry used to be, we could probably go ahead and go two to 2.5 times the volume we have today, so we have not hit any kind of capacity constraints and whether that’s in Wildcat, the Prowlers or ATVs.",,,,,,
Rommel Dionisio,Claude Jordan,"Okay. Just to clarify, you’re not bumping up against any capacity constraint for Wildcat either in the (inaudible)?",That’s correct.,,,,,,
Mark Smith,Tim Delmore,"Hi, guys. Just looking at the PG&A margins here in Q4, not quite as good as we’ve seen in the past, but just a shift in products maybe without people riding snowmobiles, accessories or garments are lower. Anything you can speak to on that and then what we should kind of look for in margins on PG&A going forward?","Yeah. Mark, this is Tim. In Q4, we had less of the snow- related high-margin products shipped, obviously, with the lower snowfall. That impacted us as well as perhaps a bit higher freight cost impacting us, although I don’t think – going forward, I think if you use history as your guide for margins, I think, in your model you’ll be fine.",,,,,,
Mark Smith,Claude Jordan,"Okay, great. And then second, just looking at ATV dealer numbers. Can you talk about any delta that we’ve seen in North America, with the addition of Wildcat?","Yeah. We don’t really break out the specific numbers. I will say that, forget about Wildcat for a second, we added a net dealers last year and by net, you’ll always lose some dealers throughout the year. And you’re always gaining. We actually added a significant number this year of dealers for both ATV and Prowler. Now some of those may have been connected, because they wanted to go ahead and carry the Wildcat line as well.
The Wildcat, obviously a lot of our dealers picked up the Wildcat. I don’t believe we had any Wildcat-only type dealers. So if you had a dealer in an area that carried ATVs and Prowlers but didn’t want the Wildcat, whether somebody else has stepped up. So, for the most part, we hired a dealer development manager about a year ago. That person has been very successful in terms of working with our sales team in terms adding additional dealers throughout the year.",,,,,,
Mark Smith,Claude Jordan,Okay. And would we see similar trends if we look international on net dealers or distribution opportunities internationally?,"You’re certainly going to see it from a distributor side. Most of our sales, other than on the ATV side, we do go direct in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, U.K. and Austria, but everywhere else we go through a distributor and we have been adding distributors throughout, outside of North America.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Tim Delmore,"Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. In 2011, you gave us an ATV shipment number and an ATV sell-through number. And, if I recall, there was a several thousand unit gap between the two. Did that persist through 2012 and can you give us those numbers?","It did persist in 2012, not to the same degree. But I did say that inventory was down 22% for ATV, Wildcat and Prowler. I said it was down 26% for just ATV and Prowlers. So, obviously, with the inventory being down, we shipped a lot less units than we retailed.",,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Tim Delmore,"Okay. But you don’t have those numbers?
",No,,,,,,
Joe Hovorka,Claude Jordan,"Okay. And I think at your snowmobile dealer meeting, you had mentioned upcoming Wildcat models. Has there been any further information about that, timing, which model?",We’ve not – what we mentioned was we certainly were excited about the Wildcat and that we were looking at some additional price points over the next 12 months.,,,,,,
Stephen Roseman,Tim Delmore,"Okay, great. Maybe you can provide some clarification from your third quarter Q. There’s a pretty meaningful discrepancy in the difference between units shipped versus dollar volume shipped in the Snowmobile category.","Don’t have that in front of me, but Q3 was a huge shift in our product mix to the higher end. The prior year, as I recall, we had a lot more international in the Q3. And Q3 this year, we had a lot of our new models, which were at the higher end of the spectrum.",,,,,,
Stephen Roseman,Tim Delmore,"So, historically, you guys have tracked pretty closely, within a few percentage points, in units versus dollars. And this year, the spread was pretty dramatic, to the tune of something like the order – I don’t think it’ll come to me right now, but something in the order of 40-percentage point.",It was no surprise to us that there was that spread. That’s just how our product mix shook out.,,,,,,
Stephen Roseman,Tim Delmore,"Do you think it’s possible you could provide some color as to where that is? Because when I look at historical Q3 shipments and the difference between two, literally we’ve never seen that type of difference. I’m trying to have a better understanding of what the product mix difference would have been to get to that order of magnitude difference in units versus dollar sales.","Just one thing, if you’d look at our – I don’t have the pricing in front of me, but there were a higher number of four strokes in our mix, for example...Turbos, a lot higher price points and that would be driving that.",,,,,,
Stephen Roseman,Tim Delmore,"So, we’ll get it here sorry, open it up, so in 2011, units up 24% versus the dollar sales up 61%, just in the Snowmobile category. Versus, for example, in 2010, it was up 33% and 33%; 2009 down 31%, down 35%. Again tracking pretty close. I understand there is a difference in the shipped, but it just struck us as worth asking about certainly when we got together with you, guys.","Very good question, but again, no surprise to us with the – we see the mix every day and every year and no surprise to us.",,,,,,
Stephen Roseman,Tim Delmore,Do you think there’s a point where you guys could provide some breakout as to how that mix manifests itself?,"We could consider that, yes.",,,,,,
