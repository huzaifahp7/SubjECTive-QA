Jason Ader,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thank you. Suresh, my question is about competition. If you had to characterize the impact from the incumbent defending share versus some of the upstarts that are spending aggressively to take share, how would you characterize the impact of each?","Jason, during Q3 the incumbents accounted for almost the entire competitive intensity increase that we saw specifically the top four incumbents accounted for over 70% of the competitive engagement that we are in and that's really where we saw very aggressive pricing and other actions that impacted us.

",,,,,,
Jason Ader,Suresh Vasudevan,"Just a quick follow-up on that so if the -- do you think we're going to see the other let's call the new generation of vendors, do you think they are seeing the same thing or do you think that this is somewhat Nimble specific because of your pull back on spending?","I think the place where the competitive intensity was particularly high was in the larger deals segment that’s become a larger part of our mix. So large deals are becoming a greater part of our mix every quarter and that's where we saw very aggressive competitive intensity from the large incumbents. To go one step further the frequency with which we compete against, let's say, younger companies, has been increasing by about one, two percentage points every quarter. And actually our win rates against those remain very consistent. So depending on the individual start up, I suspect they are seeing different competitive responses depending on whether they are competing on the high end or not.",,,,,,
Jason Ader,Suresh Vasudevan,Okay. Not having all-flash probably maybe had an impact too?,"I would say in our competitive engagements pricing action by the large vendors is by far the most dominant factor that impacted us. All-flash just this last quarter went over double-digit percentage in terms of how frequently we compete against all-flash arrays. So while it's been increasing every quarter, it's not the most material factor that impacted us, Jason.

Brent Bracelin,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thank you. I just had a follow-up here on pricing and then one another follow-up as well. Historically Suresh, pricing has always been aggressive. And in the past your technology advantage has kind of more than offset some of the pricing pressure that you have seen. So first question, why is aggressive pricing now starting to impact you more so than it has in the past?","Yeah, I think, Brent, pricing has always been a factor and I’ve said this on the last two calls, pricing has been getting more and more intense. You can see in our results this quarter that pricing actually impacted our gross margin to some degree as well. So we still maintain a very substantial advantage. But as we are getting into larger and larger deals and those are accounting for greater share of our overall business, typically pricing tends to elongate sales cycle as large enterprise, so that's affecting our conversion rate. Often, I’ve also said before this, Brent, typically, incumbents get the last word on pricing and often it ends up becoming one where the customer says let me stay with the incumbent. So that's another factor we're starting to see. It's mostly a shift in the mix of our business towards really large deals that’s starting to impact us from a pricing standpoint.",,,,,,
Brent Bracelin,Suresh Vasudevan,"Got it. So kind of a combination of mix shift to large deals and then lengthening sales cycles as pricing intensifies at least in North America with these larger enterprises. As a follow-up and thinking about next year, your guidance implies product growth of 20%, 25% here for Q4. Is that the right way to think about kind of the growth rate into next year 20%, 25%? The reason why I ask that your largest competitor EMC is potentially going private next year. They’re going to be in a position to get even more aggressive on price next year, so it just seems like the structural change around pricing could be a permanent thing at least as we think about next year. And so how are you thinking about the appropriate product growth trends that given this pricing environment we should think about for next year?","Yes. So, I'll say one thing Brent. First, we don't give guidance that’s that long-term in nature. But I want to point out there are two factors that impacted us. The first factor is that in the large enterprise segment and in the large deal segment competitive pressure has been a factor that slowed us down. Perhaps the greater impact is that in going after those larger deals and in going after those larger enterprises, we shifted investments from our commercial segment where that is the second action that we are taking to avoid that shift in investments by reinvesting in our commercial segment is what we're doing. So, as you think about our corrective actions besides sort of strengthening our competitive position in the large enterprise segment by broadening our platform, investing in commercial over the next - first two quarters of next year is really what we are doing, which I think will translate into growth again. Beyond that, I don't want to get more detailed on specific growth numbers, Brent.",,,,,,
Rajesh Ghai,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thanks. So Suresh, if I back out your Fibre Channel business from the rest of the business, iSCSI, I noticed that for the last three or four quarter's [as soon as you] [ph] started shipping fiber channel, the iSCSI contribution has kind of plateaued in the high-50s. I recognized your explanation around commercial enterprise, but it appears as if most of your growth going forward is likely to come from Fibre Channel and the iSCSI market has kind of reached a level where you potentially cannot grow going forward. Is that a fair characterization, or why not?","Yeah. Rajesh I’ll go back to what I said, really there are two things going on. One, as we shifted some investment towards going after both large enterprises and larger deployments across our customer base, that’s come at the cost of investments in our traditional midsize enterprise customer base. And that's really where iSCSI was particularly strong. And so you would -- as I've said in the past, the mix of protocol is as much a reflection of our sales capacity investments as a reflection on the market. And so as I described our one of our corrective actions being focused on reinvesting in commercial that's really aimed at making sure we get midsize customers back and that tends to be more dominated by iSCSI as a protocol.",,,,,,
Rajesh Ghai,Suresh Vasudevan,"So you don't think it's going to plateau at that point, there is room for growth in both segments, on both protocols is what you're saying?

","I think that we -- that's correct. What we care more about is growth of both our commercial base as well as our large enterprise, large deal base. The protocol mix is almost an outcome. What will tend to happen is that the lower end of our business or the commercial segment of our business will tend to favor iSCSI more, the higher end will tend to favor Fibre Channel more.

",,,,,,
Alex Kurtz,Suresh Vasudevan,"Yeah. Thanks guys. Just quick question, Suresh, on this commercial activity. You know if you look at the new customer adds in the quarter, they are still pretty strong and towards the high end of where you have executed over the last couple of years. So I guess the question is you know it still seemed like you executed at some level on the commercial business. What I am trying to solve for is what's underneath that miss executed. Because you added a lot of new logos in the quarter, was it just sort of follow-on business with the existing installed base of commercial accounts where you didn't have those investments to follow up on those accounts and drive incremental revenue?","Yeah. That's a good question. Let me start by saying our sort of land and expand model is as consistent as it's always been, so once we land a customer the pattern of repeat purchases as steady as ever. And you are right, that it was a quarter were customer acquisition was very strong. But what we had invested in was the larger deals which are not as much a reflection on customer count as much as deal sizes and really large deals. What we'd invested in was making that a larger part of our business. And so as that has pressure the number of new customers in the mid-size enterprise had to be even larger than we landed to make up for that shift in investment. So that's really what underpinned our results.",,,,,,
Alex Kurtz,Suresh Vasudevan,"It sounds like the October guidance from an enterprise perspective you guys assumed some large deals in the enterprise side we're going to close, right?
","That is exactly right.

",,,,,,
Alex Kurtz,Anup Singh,"It sounds like the October guidance from an enterprise perspective you guys assumed some large deals in the enterprise side we're going to close, right?
",That’s right.,,,,,,
Alex Kurtz,Suresh Vasudevan,"It sounds like the October guidance from an enterprise perspective you guys assumed some large deals in the enterprise side we're going to close, right?
","That is exactly right. Large deals and large enterprises were not as significant a contributor as we had modeled and we pulled investment from commercial to make that happen which reflected in not enough in the commercial side.
",,,,,,
Alex Kurtz,Suresh Vasudevan,"And just last question for the January guide, are you dialing back the assumption on enterprise execution or is it roughly the same where you had it for October?
","Well, so our belief is that the competitive intensity is which is what drove the lower than anticipated productivity in our enterprise side is going to stay in place for the next several quarters particularly as the larger incumbents are defending not just slow growth, but declining revenue we anticipate that, that will stay in place and that's really what we factored into how we think about Q4 guide.

",,,,,,
George Iwanyc,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thank you for taking my question. Can you give us a sense of when you started to see the weakness emerged and how you feel about your long-term targets given the price pressure? Are you updating what you think margins can reach in several of your timeframe?
","Yes. Let me start with the first part of the question. It was really pressure that we saw throughout Q3. Typically Q3 for us tends to be a less linear quarter because of the summer and normally month three tends to be the stronger part of Q3 even compared to normal linearity. For us this quarter throughout we noticed that there was more competitive intensity and certainly that carried on through month three. Now on the question of how do we think about our long-term, even in a quarter where we've had aggressive racing action by competitors, our gross margin is well above our target norms. So it's our product gross margin that held up well even in an environment that is intense competitive intensity. So we are not changing what our belief is about our long-term gross margin model. Secondly when you look at our mature commercial teams, they are operating well above breakeven levels of productively. So we already know that there is a marketing investment support the kind of business model that we are trying to build. What I think you are really seeing is a transition in the marketplace and not – and that's really what's causing sort of more probation in the short-term. We are not changing our perspective on what the long-term business model looks like.",,,,,,
"Simona Jankowski
",Suresh Vasudevan,"Hi. Thank you very much. I certainly appreciate some of the tactical issues you highlighted in terms of the focus on commercial versus enterprise and then the competitive backdrop. But just in terms of some of the more strategic decisions around the roadmap. How do you feel about a couple of areas the choice of focusing on fiber channel versus for example, hyper-converged infrastructures which does seem to be gaining traction and then also the timing of the flash products? How you think about that and if you think that will be helpful in giving you another tool to battle some of the industry dynamics?","Yeah Simona, let me start with the second part of your question which is really around the flash, All-Flash product question. As I said before, we absolutely believe that having the broad platform that spans every workload is important. We have also said that we have a very concrete plan for broadening our flash platform to compete in the entire space and that is still very much on target. You’d expect to see us -- you should expect to see us participating in the entire market with both hybrid flash and all-flash market if you will. The second question really around hyper-convergence versus convergence versus standalone storage. We still continue to believe while there is growth in hyper-convergence in certain workloads there is enormous growth in both standalone flash centric storage as well as converged flash centric storage. We still believe we have a very strong platform to address the entire spectrum of flash centric storage requirements and our partnership with Cisco and creating SmartStack converged infrastructure allowing us to participate really well in converged deployment. So, I think the pace at which we're executing are roadmap and the direction of the roadmap very, very strong confidence in where we're headed.",,,,,,
John Roy,Anup Singh,"Hi. It's John Roy in for Steve. Quickly on your profitability, obviously, it’s not going to come next quarter. Do you have any type of color you can give us on when it might be? And also, are you still seeing a 3x to 4x advantage in pricing even though with the discounting?
","So, John, this is Anup. On the question of getting to profitability, the way we’re thinking about it is the investments we’ve talked in the first half of the year for next year is going to lead to a decrease in leverage as compared to margins of this year. So, if you compare first-half to first-half, you'll see a decrease in leverage. We expect however the investment that we're making that Suresh articulated will have an impact starting the second half of next year and therefore we should get back to showing an improvement and leverage in the model in the second half of next year as compared to the second half of this year. Apart from that at this stage, we are not offering of any guidance in terms of the long-term sort of break even or the past profitability.",,,,,,
John Roy,Anup Singh,"Hi. It's John Roy in for Steve. Quickly on your profitability, obviously, it’s not going to come next quarter. Do you have any type of color you can give us on when it might be? And also, are you still seeing a 3x to 4x advantage in pricing even though with the discounting?
","And John on price performance it very much remains in place. I think as I have said before what we're witnessing are instances, numerous instances where our competitors already over the last few quarters I have said they are coming close to that cost in order to hold us off, particularly in large accounts and large deployments. We are witnessing even stronger pricing pressure where they're going under the cost in order to retain footprint. And as you can see, we don't back away just because someone is taking aggressive price, even with the pricing pressure our gross margin stays very strong. So price performance advantage is best reflected in how our margins are performed very much still in place.
",,,,,,
John Roy,Suresh Vasudevan,"Great. And did you see the pressure more coming from NetApp or from EMC?
","No I think I'd say it's equally from EMC as well as NetApp and I would say HP as well. So the top four vendors for us have all almost sort of a reaction to e-serve all becomes much more price aggressive.
",,,,,,
Amit Daryanani,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess just following on that question, Anup, it's you from I guess replying backward pricing or competitive pressure on your own side because your gross margins are ahead of your own locking target. Do you now see there is enough price velocity I guess in this marketplace for you to lower margin and potentially take more share and hit those targets you've had in the past?","Yeah. Amit, this is a good question. I think we have answered -- address this before as well and I will say this on any given deal typically we don't walk away because there is a point at which we are not willing to match our competitor on price. In larger deals what we tend to see sort of happening as a result of price is two things. One, the customer evaluation cycle gets longer and so often deals that we've noticed a greater than 10% elongation in our sales cycle, as customer spend more time sort of going back and forth if you will on the decision-making and that's one factor. The second factor is in many instances the last word the long's to the incumbent. In many instances when EMC or NetApp's say they are willing to go all the way down in price to hold off any single project that tends to be the barrier. What we have also noticed is every one of those instances is one where we go back on the next project or the project after that to the same customer. So you may lose a project on price, but inevitably the fact that we have been evaluated by the customer who keeps the door open for us.",,,,,,
Amit Daryanani,Suresh Vasudevan,"Got it. And then on the second part when you talk about shifting investment from commercial enterprises on performance. I missed this in the past, but what exactly did you stop investing on the commercial side that's hurting you and what exactly investing to help you?

","There are really three changes that impacted us. One is when we look at a mix of teams that we brought on board, over half of the teams in the last four quarters have been non-commercial teams named account teams. So number of sales teams we are adding is lower in the commercial segment than traditionally has been. That is the first thing. The second one which has even more short-term impact is we have a lot of marketing programs, channel programs aimed at opportunity generation and these are fairly short-cycle opportunity generation. Typically 75 to 90 days cycles in which they convert and so we pull investments from both marketing and channel or shifted investments toward larger enterprise wins rather than commercial wins. Both of those investments that we intend to grow back and add again in our business model.",,,,,,
Aaron Rakers,Anup Singh,"Thanks. I want to build on that question. I believe, Anup there was a third item there. I'm sorry I didn’t -- I heard one and two but I didn't catch number three. What was the third item in terms of pulling back on the commercial side?","It’s a marketing which says that’s one and third one is channel programs. So we have about half of our opportunities are marketing sourced, another half of our opportunities are channel sourced.
",,,,,,
Aaron Rakers,Suresh Vasudevan,"Okay. And with that said with that point I believe in the past you've always talked about long-term model as kind of mid-60% product gross margin, should we now assume that we’re trending to that level quicker than what previously maybe you would have thought given those incremental investments and if so when do you think we should maybe think about mid-60s rather than the 68% you’ve been running out?
","Yes. So, I think we expect the competitive environment to continue. Certainly the discounting and pricing environment we are currently in. Our long-term target for margins, for products is in the 64% to 66 % range. We still are comfortably above that. Our margins and products are about 68. We think that this will trend down a bit over a time. Our support and service you might have noticed is going up. So to some extent it's offset out on margins over all. But definitely I think incrementally over time, we're going to start to approach our long-term model.",,,,,,
Aaron Rakers,Suresh Vasudevan,So what's your product gross margin assumption this current quarter?,"We don't offer up the details -- the guidance on margin Aaron. But in offering up the guidance for Q4 as we said, we've taken the competitive environment into account and we have modeled it accordingly.
",,,,,,
Aaron Rakers,Suresh Vasudevan,"Okay. And final question for me is on the enterprise productivity, I'm just kind of curious -- where do we stand on the productivity curve maybe relative to what you would have thought of may be coming out of the July quarter and -- as you bring on these new named account teams, just remind us again how long it takes us to see them ramp to that kind of targeted productivity?
","Yes so I think we are not actually giving you specifics on the past. Let me just say what we have said in the past is typically our commercial teams Aaron takes around four quarters before they are on the same curve as our mature teams. And enterprise teams, we had said, sort of was slightly longer than that. What we are now seeing is that full productivity of our enterprise teams is perhaps four quarters longer than our commercial teams and that's really sort of is how we are seeing this. It takes about a couple of years before enterprise teams yield the kind of full productivity that we are looking for.",,,,,,
Katy Huberty,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess looking forward, what changes in large enterprise given that the incumbents are willing to price aggressively and they get the last bid. What can you do to change those dynamics? And then secondly, should we now assume that the goal of breakeven is off the table until you start to see that enterprise business really ramp as expected? Thank you.

","Yes. Let me address the first one, Katie. I want to start by saying, when you look at our business in terms of mix of Fibre Channel, when you look at our business in terms of bookings from deals over 250,000, 500,000 notwithstanding the competitive environment and the pricing environment those are growing and growing faster than our overall business. And they are becoming a larger portion of our mix. And so let me start by saying that the trajectory of what we're seeing at the high-end of our business is moving along well. Our concern is that the kind of return we wanted from our investments, we were essentially looking for more leverage in those investments than we're seeing. So, it's more a question of how long before they become as productive as our commercial segment rather than that we are not able to make progress. So, it's much more of profitability question rather than success in the enterprise question. Now with that said, that goes back to your second part of the question which is, what do we expect from a profitability standpoint? It is true that we've not given specific guidance on when we expect to get back to breakeven. The investments we’re making in the first we believe will take the first half of next year and that's when we're going to see sort of most of the investments concentrated. And so second half you should start to say leverage again in our model relative to this year. Beyond that we're not getting specific on what that translates into for breakeven.",,,,,,
Brian Alexander,Anup Singh,"Yeah. Thanks. To what extent do you think public cloud adoption AWS and the like is having an impact on revenue trends for either your enterprise customers or your commercial customers? And then maybe just a little bit more quantification on the magnitude of investments that you're planning in terms of number of hires, headcount et cetera. I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of investment and how that's going to change over the next few quarters. Thanks.","Ryan with regard to the investment question and try to quantify that. I think as we have said we're making investments in the business especially in the first half of next year that we believe will reaccelerate our growth in the future. And as I alluded to before, the leverage as a result of those investments in the first half of the year will be negative as compared to this year. We expect to see the leverage improving in the second half of next year as we see the benefits of those investments. The other thing I would say as we look at our overall investments, we are doing is somewhat of a careful assessment of spending in to other areas of the business as we increase our investment in these areas of sales and marketing and the commercial business and then broadening the platform that we have. So we're going to be cautious and looking for leverage in other areas of the business, but we expect our investments to start to pay-off in the second half of next year.

Maynard Um,Suresh Vasudevan,"Hi. Thanks. I'm a little puzzled about your competitive intensity and pricing comment. You got two large competitors, if you look at their gross margins this quarter they have been fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. So I'm wondering if this intensity is something that's more recent, is it just now you decided to be more reactionary this quarter versus last quarter? And then separately last year your sales and marketing spends grew 4.7 million sequentially and it sounds like you're going to be investing more. So should we use that as a benchmark to look at a growth north of that for this quarter or is that not a good benchmark to look at? Thanks.","Let me take the first comment, Maynard. When I said the competitive intensity is higher, we are certainly seeing that reflected in longer sales cycle. We are seeing instances where discount of 90 points off are not just one-off, but fairly frequent and so we certainly are seeing a more aggressive pricing response from our some NetApp, EMC and others than we did in prior quarters. Now, there is a second factor that is also very relevant. The mix of large deals is moving up substantially for us every quarter. And so even as we see our larger deal that's really where they are more aggressive, so for us the impact is somewhat more exaggerated because more of our deals now are coming from greater than $0.5 million, greater than $250,000 deals they are being much more aggressive about defending share.",,,,,,
Maynard Um,Anup Singh,"Hi. Thanks. I'm a little puzzled about your competitive intensity and pricing comment.

So should we use that as a benchmark to look at a growth north of that for this quarter or is that not a good benchmark to look at?

So hopefully it’ll give you an idea to the OpEx trends there.

James Kisner,Anup Singh,"Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just question about cash and cash management, so I was wondering given the velocity to make a more concerted efforts that net working capital out of certain opportunity on the table to preserve cash and I know you have a pretty good balance here right now, but do you have a minimum balance in mind in terms of cash in your balance sheet to run your business and to ensure customers?
","Yes, James so the good news on cash if you look at our cash situation for all of last year we basically were breakeven in cash. For the first three quarters of this year so far our cash is actually slightly up. And actually as we look ahead to Q4 which is usually a better quarter for us from a linearity standpoint we expect our cash to go up in Q4, right? So I think again we're not offering any guidance for next year, but I would say that so far we’ve been growing our business, we’ve been making investments and still we’ve been avoiding a burning of cash situation as a company.

",,,,,,
Richard Kugele,Suresh Vasudevan,"Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to take a bigger question here. Suresh if you had to look back over the past calls, even just four quarters, how much do you think you've forsaken on growth at the expense of keeping the costs down to hit this breakeven for next quarter. How much growth do you think it cost you? And then looking at it another way, with the investment that you are making what do you think the company should be growing at? Because clearly you must have a target in mind in order to invest properly.","Yes. Good question. So, let me go back to the first part of your question, Rich. When I talk about -- I want to underscore one comment, which is the competitive intensity we are seeing and some of the comments I made about large deals taking longer and impacting our pipeline conversion while that’s going on the commercial segment overall our win rates did not change much as a company. In the commercial segment we have a very proven model that generates a very well understood pattern of return and the shift in investment is really what caused us to actually lose some steam on the commercial segment. And so as I go back to the first part of your question, this idea of managing our operating expense envelope within a certain guideline did cause that shift and that's really what cost us our growth because fundamentally our investment in commercial are still bearing fruit with the same pattern and we know that making those investments will get that growth back for us. That is not a place where we are seeing all of the competitive intensity that I've been describing. So that’s the first comment I would make. That's also what's guiding our next steps which is making the investments back in commercial will return us to growth, it will take a couple of quarters for those investments to take to bear fruit, but second half of next year we do expect to reaccelerate growth. Now, in terms of a specific target for growth for a specific long-term number, I'm not going to give you more specific than that which other than to say we always offer it with certain growth aspirations, which shows this quarter because of the investment correcting that we believe will return us back to being able to have those same aspirations.",,,,,,
Richard Kugele,Suresh Vasudevan,"Okay. Then just lastly, if you adjust for currency, you're mix versus the midpoint was only $3.5 million, but the increase in the operating loss was double. So the difference there is the increase investments on the enterprise. Is that the way we should look at that?","So the impact of the currency has a big negative effect on our operating income because the majority of our cost certainly manufacturing we saw in North America revenue is reported international. So the impact on revenue was 2.8 million, the impact on operating income was about 1.5 million this quarter.
",,,,,,
Kulbinder Garcha,Suresh Vasudevan,Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first one is for Suresh. On the choices you guys are making with respect to investment I guess how does that change running the business going forward because it seems you were making some trade-off between commercial enterprises which impacted given the revenue line.And given your state of penetration of both segments very early I guess you need to have a lot more premium managing that cost base going forward and does that inject certain volatility into your results sort of think about how you think about managing the business going forward? And then clarification to revenue let's say miss that you guys are seeing is it because you lost deals and its really because the pricing environment is causing elongated sales cycle is that what you're saying just to be clear?,"Start with the second one which is the revenue decrease we are seeing is on the higher end, it’s the elongated sales cycle and the fact that in larger deals our win rates have been always sort of more challenge than in our lower end deals. And so I want to say the mix shift towards larger deals fits the explanation that you have given.The second reason for the revenue shortfall is that we did not have enough investments in our commercial business which translates into opportunity generation and pipeline and that's what we're reinvesting it. So that's just to give you a sense that both drivers were in place for us this quarter. On the larger question of what is our investment philosophy I will start by saying if I take a three year perspective, not much has changed from our perspective on what's likely to happen in this market. There is still a shift from disk centric architectures to flash centric architectures. We absolutely believe we have the broadest flash platform and one of the investments that we mentioned is in broadening the flash platform to address every form of deploying flash. And so we fundamentally believe that that shift is not being challenged and that legacy vendors will not be able to fight that shift back. So with that said, the constraint investment is what led us to not have as much growth as we aspired to. So we are going to invest more in the first half. I will also say that this is not at the same time abandonment of the belief that you need to both have the growth as well as operating leverage and that's why we believe in the second half you'll see operating leverage back compared to this year second half in our business model. So we continue to improve operating leverage and that will be the guideline we will use to drive our investments.",,,,,,
Kulbinder Garcha,Suresh Vasudevan,And then maybe just one other one asking the question with respect to your pricing in other way. If you guys were to become more aggressive with your own pricing would that really change your revenue outlook means for you over the next couple of quarters given it's more elongated sales cycles and discussion and larger deal size in the shift -- should I guess the concern is what is in the six month time we're talking about gross margin in the low 60s because this is a new industry environment. Do you or not you not see that as a risk right now?,"Now I think -- I still feel very comfortable in the target gross margin model we have used. There's still a lot of room between where we operate and what the target model looks like. I also want to underscore, we have very strong win rates in the high end. It just happens to be the win rates are different from what we have enlisted 100K deals, the half a million dollar deal. So we have very strong win rates on the high end and the pricing is not fundamentally stopping our progress. I answered an earlier question by saying our growth rate in larger deals, growth rate in Fibre Channel are all above the company growth rate. And so that still making really good progress. I'm not at a point where I feel like we have to abandon our gross margin model at all. We very much feel that we can maintain that gross margin model.",,,,,,
Keith Bachman,Suresh Vasudevan,"Hi. I wanted to come back to that last point. A couple of observations. One you've made the comment essentially that the profit pool of the storage time that you are pursuing has declined because of pricing pressure. In kind you are actually making more investments to respond to that so you're actually participating in the lower profit pool, combined with it's just not clear to me that NetApp, HP, EMC and Hitachi are going to change their behavior. You could argue they keep getting aggressive to keep their systems in place even if it's below cost just to secure the maintenance streams associated with it. So I'm unclear. You’ve said a couple of different times you think you can generate leverage in the second half of next year. I don't think you’ve made the case why. It's not clear that you actually can return or improve your leverage even as we look out over a period of time. So I’d like to hear why you think you can improve your leverage, your profit rates given the backdrop?

","I’m happy to address that, Keith. If you look at where we are placing our investments, the big investment we are making in our commercial segment. That's adding commercial teams and in programs aimed at driving opportunity generation for the productivity of our commercial teams. Today our mature commercial teams operate well above breakeven levels of productivity. And so investments we make and we also have a very well understood pattern of how long it takes for us to bring on a commercial team, how long it takes for us to get that commercial team to be on the same curve as a mature team and that is on the outside four quarters. Now some of the investments we make will not just help with new teams we bring on they actually make our existing teams more productive as well. So, we are very confident that the first investment stream that directed at our commercial segment has a well understood pattern of payoff, pulling investment from that is what cost us growth, putting investment back there we know will not just drive growth, but also drive operating leverage. The second investment we're making is really in broadening our flash platform which is aimed at the large deal segment. I want to say one other thing. In the large deal segment, even as I said the price competition our win rates there are healthy. Well that's what's driving a faster growth for us in that segment. Fibre Channel is now almost a quarter of the mix of protocols. It was just 17.5% a quarter ago, right? So we're seeing really good progress there broadening our flash platform will only help that segment as well. That's sort of how I think about the investments and why they are not just supportive of growth but they are supportive of leverage as well.",,,,,,
Keith Bachman,Suresh Vasudevan,"Okay. How long does a company and the Board pursue this strategy before possibly considering other strategic alternatives? In other words if you -- another couple of quarters margins don't improve and indeed pricing persists which could cause ongoing pressure on the business, how long does the company look at that before deciding perhaps make different strategic choices?


","At this point I think we've given you a sense for how we are thinking about our business model which is the investments we make will bring us into the same sort -- will impact our leverage in the first half of this year and the second half will improve our leverage. The reality is that from a cash perspective so far this year, we have essentially generated cash. So this is a business that is not burned cash all through this year. When you look at some of our competitors and you contrast our approach to cash management it's extremely prudent. We are not anywhere close to abandoning the prudent approach to managing cash and so I don't feel like we're taking undue risks. These are well understood investments that we know have a good return. So, I think at this point that is really the outlook on how we want to operate our business model.",,,,,,
Keith Bachman,Anup Singh,"Okay. How long does a company and the Board pursue this strategy before possibly considering other strategic alternatives?

","So, Keith, this is Anup. I just want to add something that Suresh said in terms of the confidence in the leverage in the model we are going forward. So we talk about the time to maturity of sales team that we bring on board, just to give you a perspective. So, less than 60% of the team that we have on board are actually in the mature category. So we have a lot of teams on board that we’ve brought on in the last year that we expect will improve the P&L in the back half of next year.",,,,,,
Joe Wittine,Anup Singh,"Hi. Thank you. About a forward question. Should we expect down seasonality in April? I know you won't guide specifically, but at least talk us through it. You've been kind of growth enough up until now to offset any down seasonality, so its talking through that it could prevent a potential surprise 90 days from now because I think still is modeling some sequential growth in April. Thanks.","Yeah. And Joe, this is Anup. We said a few times in the past that Q1 obviously for us in the industry as a whole is seasonally down as a quarter. As a matter of fact when you look at some of the larger companies, these guys are down in double-digits in Q1 from Q4. As we start to do our modeling out and so on for next year, we absolutely should expect seasonality as well to impact to our numbers.
