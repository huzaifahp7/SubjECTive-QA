Howard Halpern,Ari Kahn,"I'm okay. With I guess, the restructuring complete, can I guess you go over a little bit of now what and you have now offered units what's the average sales cycle time and then implementation once a customer is acquired?","Sure, sure. So the Celebros product line has an average sales cycle of two or three weeks, so we had made six sales and 12 weeks in our third quarter, so I guess that's a two-week average and there is very little implementation effort on that is may be a week worth of implementation. On both the OrchestraCMS and the Bridgeline Unbound, the sales cycles there are four to six months with implementation times and with six-month range as well.The OrchestraCMS sales we tend to commence those deals later in the sales cycle because we're being introduced by salesforce.com in many cases. So the sales cycle might already be two months in before we enter that [indiscernible] four months of our participation.",,,,,,
Howard Halpern,Ari Kahn,"Okay, and now, I guess in terms of really nice outlook for 2020, what for modeling purposes I guess, what would you estimate what top line revenue would get you to operating income or operating breakeven?","Sure. So, we're going to have top line income in the $5 million range to be generating net income and most of that revenue is kind of locked in already. We are not recognizing all of that yet because of this transaction accounting and the acquired contracts. But the first anniversary for all the acquired contracts is February 2020. And at that point, based on what we have already we're going to be pretty close there and we think that we're going to be generating positive net income early in 2020.And also, you know, we've got no debt on the books right now. We finished the quarter with decent cash balance and do not anticipate doing any equity raising or anything between now and then, possibly establishing a credit line or something, but that would be it.",,,,,,
Howard Halpern,Ari Kahn,"Okay and now that you've sort of established this industry platform are there any, is there a pipeline that you're looking at a potential bolt-on type acquisitions that could leverage what you've done?","Right, well we are being approached by companies regularly, like more than once a month to review acquiring them. So we're seeing a lot of activity there and we able to integrate these businesses very quickly within three months. The company operates as a single company. So from an operational perspective, integrating another $2 million to $5 million business would not be a problem at all.That said, we want to establish a couple of quarters of showing bottom-line results. We think that that's going to be meaningful to investors. So our primary focus is operations right now is more of an opportunistic review of incoming acquisitions. We do think that strategic acquisitions are a key part of our future and in 2020 we'll make an even greater concerted effort to review opportunities.",,,,,,
Howard Halpern,Ari Kahn,"Okay, well keep up the great work. It seems like the transformation is going as planned.","Great, thank you.",,,,,,
Pearl Lee,Ari Kahn,"Hi. We just have a brief question on the goodwill impairment and financial, can you repeat what the goodwill impairment is for this quarter and then go and explain why you have the goodwill impairment cost impact over the past like five quarters?",Sure. So we did not have goodwill impairment this quarter. We had goodwill impairment the same period last year. And that impairment is really just based on our stockholders equity versus the share price. So it was not a cash event and had nothing to do with operations or revenues or anything like that.,,,,,,
Pearl Lee,Ari Kahn,"Okay, so going a little bit further on that, I think for your quarter two 10-Q and the goodwill portion you kind of noted that some of the goodwill impairments costs came from what was CMS acquisition, are you saying that that's true?","So that would be, I got to pull off last quarter's to look at that. So this quarter Q3 there is not, and in Q2 it is really related to the same thing. So we did a capital raise in Q2 that changed stockholders equity and the market price of the stock is what invokes the goodwill impairment. That was the same thing I was talking about a year ago.",,,,,,
