Min Park,Gregory M. Spierkel ,"Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of questions please. First, while your North American revenue growth was better than the reported number after taking account the change in the accounting for warranty sales, what percent year-over-year is a bit closer than what you have been seeing more recently. Can you tell us if there is anything company specific that's causing the slowdown, is it more of a function of the macro environment?","We believe it's probably more a function of the overall macro environment. As I said before Min, we have seen relative softness in the Government and large corporate segments but we have seen relative strength as well in our retail business and also in our specialty units in the Avid division and in the data capture point of sale division as well. But I do believe that overall we are doing fairly well in the market, kind of maintaining our share there but it is a bit spotty in demand overall.",,,,,,,,,
Min Park,Gregory M. Spierkel ,"And following, you mentioned that you are seeing improvement in the month of June, as seeing a good tail wind in July. Can you tell us how North America exited the quarter and what you are seeing for that first month in the quarter?","Actually our comment on relative strength in June and the first part of July was related to Europe... our European business and in particular what we have been seeing in Germany. I think overall in North America... as the quarter progressed kind of as expected, we did see a bit more strength later on in the quarter but overall I would tell you it wasn't much different that what we would have expected to see.",,,,,,,,,
Min Park,Gregory M. Spierkel ,"Okay. And just lastly, can you help us understand what's happening with your margins in Europe? We would have expected you to deliver better margins year-over-year since you are not seeing HP's consolidation as the headwind this year?","Yes, and in Europe first of all I think we had a good performance overall in Europe. We had Spain and the UK and France actually perform well both on top line as well as their overall profitability performance. In Germany where we have been focused against recapture of market share we have had to apply additional resources against mitigation in service levels on warehouse management system, that is back to normal. But in addition that incremental costs just to regain market share back now we did see a recapture of most of that share late in the quarter in June. We do expect to see that going forward and in addition to that we do expect to see I guess a mitigation of some of the costs that we've had to expend in Germany, start the taper off through the second half of the year. But overall the activities in Germany did dampen overall margins for the business and in addition to that Italy and Hungry still represents opportunities for us.",,,,,,,,,
Matthew Sheerin,William D. Hume,Thomas Weisel Partners. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the question regarding your revenue guidance. Could you remind us the revenue run rate for DBL. I think it's around $300 million and will you see a full quarter's worth of that in the September quarter?,"Yeah, Matt this is Bill. Last year in 2006 DBL had about $300 million in revenue. It's growing in the mid teens essentially, I would expect on a year-over-year basis. So you can do the math on the individual quarterly, we won't disclose separately but it's roughly... it's pretty estimatable. And we acquired that right at the end of June, so what we ended up getting is all the balance sheet but really no P&L in the June quarter. And then so it will be basically a substantial... sequential increase.",,,,,,,,,
Matthew Sheerin,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay, so if you back that out your guidance still suggests that you are doing a little bit better than seasonal, it sounds like Europe is part of that because you are getting some market share back in Germany, does Asia continue to look strong for you going into the September quarter or is there some seasonality there?","It's Greg here, I would say Asia definitely is looking solid for rest of the record that we've had over the last three or four quarters which has been very healthy double digit growth that we believe is one that we can sustain, one because the market is doing well but two, as we feel very good about our performance there. The company has been I think growing significantly above market and there is nothing [indiscernible] healthy trajectory that we've had out of that region recently.",,,,,,,,,
Matthew Sheerin,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Great, could you just drill down a little bit more on why you have been so successful there in a relatively short period over the last few quarters or so by product area, market segment, and are you seeing increased competition or at some point any threats out there whether it be pricing or anything else?","It's been a function of first and foremost matter of us making the integration with tech specific work and work well. Lot of credit we've picked up I think what we thought was a very strong management team with very complementary products, in some cases, where we overlap each other too much, and different strengths from a product perspective, and a customer base. You know, clearly the momentum that we are seeing recently is a function of that good integration, which was significant in the countries like India and Australia, where we both had a very large operations, and we are finding ourselves in a situation where we have got very healthy growth across IT products, and telephony products interestingly enough out of India so we are managing, because of some new products, and a new product category to do very well with that there. And clearly there is a lot of growth and expansion capability in what's called upcountry in India, which is outside the major metropolitan areas and we have a very good footprint. We are in sales offices in over 40 cities and over 30 distribution points. So that gives us a huge advantage compared to maybe some of our competitors are not as strong, or as broad and can't invest as much as we can. So a lot of vendors, and a lot of opportunities coming to us as a result of the good work and the infrastructure we have put in place there. And I wouldn't want to lose sight either of two or three other things that are happening in the region. In some of the smaller countries, they just don't get the mention nearly as much, whether that is Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand or New Zealand, we are seeing our company operate at levels better than our competitors. Again because the portfolio what we call carrier is fairly broad, the vendor community is extremely supportive of us, and the last I mentioned is really also made a big difference in the last year, year and a half from where we here lets say two years ago, three years ago, is that our China business, as we have mentioned to the Street and to all of you on calls, we went through a very significant change there two years back. And in fact pulled back on the size of the operations to get good controls and systems in place, and we put a great foundation in place with... leading that change, and since that change over the last 6 to 8 quarters, we have had excellent growth. Again, same situation as India, the breath of the portfolio increasing, the breath of country, cities sorry and territories is increasing, and that's giving us a chance to accelerate I think what we are seeing other companies do in the region.",,,,,,,,,
Matthew Sheerin,Kevin M. Murai,"Okay, and just lastly regarding Asia, do you still have a strong presence in the components, and processors, and other PC components, and how is that business doing?","We do. It's doing well in probably the countries like China and India where there is still a fairly large wide box market, but I would say more of our growth is coming from finished systems whether that's laptops who have become very competitive on a worldwide level from the major OEM's or in networking, even software is starting to grow at healthier pace than we would have seen a few years ago as more, and more companies comfortable with buying software as opposed to coping it. So there are a number of facets that are helping us in that regard through the region.",,,,,,,,,
Brian Alexander,Kevin M. Murai,"And I guess, the first question I have relates to European profitability just to better understand. So the warehouse issue which sounds like it's kind of fully resolved, and you are starting to get efficiencies out of the German warehouse system, what was the impact if there is anyway to quantify the margins in the quarter, and could you help us think about whether that was more of a gross margin impact as you had to price more aggressively to regain market share, or is it more of an OpEx issue because you still had some extra cost that you had to incur?","Yeah, I mean it was really both. There are investments that we had to make to recapture share of both that gross margin but again investing in some marketing programs to drive incremental growth in our business as well. So, it's hard to actual quantify and break out exactly what that impact was to overall European results except, I do want just reiterate again though that I mean overall our business in Europe in many countries was very, very good, and in addition to the strong growth that we had in certain countries and some of the uptake that we saw through the quarter in Germany, we will also continue to have opportunities though as we take a look at our Italy and Hungary businesses. And that's really been the story on the margin in Europe is starting of with the improvements that we been making slowly in Germany but also a little bit dampened by Italy and Hungary.",,,,,,,,,
Brian Alexander,Kevin M. Murai ,"Okay. And then just as a follow up, when you say that you are turning the corner in Europe are you making comments more around Ingram's specific situation that is turning the corner, are you making comments more around the market turning the corner because given that it is July and usually seasonally slow around this time of the year I guess I am surprised to hear that you are just picking up now?","Yeah, that comment really is an Ingram Micro comment. I think, we are feeling pretty good about where we have come from over the past say three and half quarters, in particular the German situation. Now in addition to that though we have seen slightly stronger than typical demand at this time of the year in Europe too, so having that little bit of wind at our backs is certainly going to help our business too.",,,,,,,,,
Brian Alexander,Gregory M. Spierkel,And my final question just relates to Dell and what they might do from a two step distribution strategy. I don't know if you have any additional insights relative to last quarter that you can share in terms of your expectation as to whether they embrace two step distribution in particular geographies as they expand their channel strategy,"Brian, it is Greg here. I mean nothing really overshadowing, and you clearly... as you know Dell is an important relationship for us, one of our larger customers through the software and peripheral supply that we have into their company and we been following and monitoring like everyone is. Their recent entry into the retail space and their ongoing touching if you may have a certain portion of the S&P customers that we support across North America and they have been more public about that in the last month or two. I suspect Dell will see how things go with the retail opportunity, I expect Dell will continue to asses all routes to market. They haven't... they haven't made any avert signals to go into two tier distribution, but if you are reviewing everything and I suspect you are reviewing everything and at some point they may surprise us all but at this stage there is nothing else we can say because there is nothing else that we are aware of that they are doing in two tier right now.",,,,,,,,,
Richard Gardner,Kevin M. Murai,"Its Citigroup. I would like to also say best of luck to you Kevin. I have two questions first of all, I wanted to understand in Europe whether going into the third quarter there's additional temporary cost associated with the German issue that is going to come out or is the margin improvement that we are going to see in Europe for the balance of the year primarily a function of operating leverage on the investments that you have been making there?","I think Richard we will probably see some incremental cost but probably to a much smaller extent than what we are seeing through Q2. We do expect that in the second half of this year though we are going to absolutely leverage the investments that we have made so, not just in the market share win backs in Germany but also in fine tuning and optimizing that warehouse management system and driving higher levels of productivity and longer-term taking the cost equation down from there as well.",,,,,,,,,
Richard Gardner,Kevin M. Murai,"Okay and then Kevin I also wanted to ask you, your commentary on the U.S. this quarter was... it sounded a little bit different than last quarter. I think on last quarter's call you talked about U.S. demand being weak early in the quarter or North American demand but then rebounding during the month of March. It sounds like demand may have slackened again at some point in the June quarter. Can you help us understand what Q2 was like in North America relative to Q1 and which parts of the business got better or worse, and sort of what the linearity of the quarter looked like?","Yeah, on the linearity question I guess it is a little bit more difficult to answer because we do have our own linearity just based on our own calendar of our quarter itself. But really I think what we saw in the second quarter that perhaps may have created some softness relative to Q1 was in the government area and then continued softness in the corporate marketplace. Those were probably the biggest areas that we saw relative weakness.",,,,,,,,,
Richard Gardner,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Interesting Richard, Greg here, one other quick comment too. Of all the geographies we are operating in right now with the four major regions, the North America markets for the first time that I can recall in a while is the slowest growing in the IT sector and its somewhat reflective of our results that we are seeing right now too.","Interesting Richard, Greg here, one other quick comment too. Of all the geographies we are operating in right now with the four major regions, the North America markets for the first time that I can recall in a while is the slowest growing in the IT sector and its somewhat reflective of our results that we are seeing right now too",,,,,,,,,
Richard Gardner,Kevin M. Murai,"Okay and then just finally when you talk about weakness in corporate, is that primarily large corporate, same as you saw last quarter or have you seen some weakening in the small to mid size business area in June as well?","It's primarily large corporate. This small to mid size business I think is doing relatively well. The growth is going to change quarter-to-quarter, it still continues to be one of the strongest segments that we have. I do believe though that as we continue to implement or not to implement as we continue to move down the path of our new infrastructure technology division, that's going to help to spur growth for us in particular in more of that corporate space with the higher end products serving there as-well-as being able to serve the SMB markets to.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,William D. Humes,"Thanks, couple of things first on more the financial side and the housekeeping side of the equation. If I take a look at the slide 6, I see the add back on the $15 million charge but if I also want to really make it comparable year-over-year and adjust for the warranty change in accounting as well, would I be correct in commenting about $1.74 margin on that by adding about $6 million back on the opline for the $165 million on the top line?","This is Bill. Parry, the SEC charge was basically 18 basis points overall. I think you are referring to North America operating margin.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,William D. Humes,"Yeah, North America specifically, I'm sorry. Because it looks like a 45 bips set back on the SEC charge then if I add, try to adjust for the warranty accounting in North America, it looks like it might take the op margins of about 173 or 174 number?","No the warranty actually had a positive impact on overall North America by about three, no five basis points overall on operating margin. So, essentially if you were to do your math you would add back the 45 basis points from the SEC charge and then subtract the incremental from the operating margin.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,William D. Humes,"Got it and then just in terms of stock-comp, is the current quarter level of stock comp about the right number to think about for the rest of the year?","Yeah, roughly. I mean they bounce around by about $1 million or shy of that and the increase largely is due to two factors one, at the beginning of the year we implemented a new retirement provision within our overall long-term incentive scheme plan for certain aged and tenured employees as well as we had to true up some of our forfeiture assumptions that you have to put in to the overall model in Black Shoals. So at this point I think it's roughly about right within give or take a $1 million.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay and then at a higher level, first on you guys made a decision to accelerate some investments, I think you highlighted here earlier in the call Germany, North America, Argentina, etcetera where is the decision point coming, what will be the factors that would cause you guys to perhaps accelerate some additional investments may be keeping up margins little lower in the back half of the year like you did in the first half of the year?","I think, Parry it is Greg here. As a team we've been making some investments in the acquisition front that are going to I think favorably work for us, clearly bringing better margins into the portfolio, it has been something that we've can conscientiously investing in over the last year or two to counter balance if you may the ongoing pressures in what I call the volume of commodity side of the portfolio. But that also brings with it to some extent some incremental cost because those are higher margins and usually slightly higher cost to build those revenues into the company. So I think those will be factors that will help us in the back half of the year and I think overall just improvements in our performance that we have got some of the first half of your challenges out of our way. We really do feel that most of the challenges that we were managing through Q3 or Q4 of last year going into the first half of this year are out of our way. So while the market is always interesting we have got most of the internal challenges out of our way right now which is good for us.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,Kevin M. Mura,"Okay and now on the product mix side of the equation any particular areas that you guys would highlight as areas of broad strength or broad weakness, obviously the PC unit numbers that have been prior... previously disclosed look pretty solid maybe any other broader comments could be helpful?","Yes, again we have four key broad product categories that we always talk about. We stayed within those norms of ranges again, peripherals being 40% to 45% of our business. Peripherals grew slightly less than our overall company rate and then the other three categories of systems, software, and networking all grew just slightly more. So it was interesting this quarter there was no real stand out category as you may although there is individual vendors or individual products in there but really they were all cupping the 11% growth rate that we had a few above and one area just below but very close to that 11% growth rate.",,,,,,,,,
Unidentified Analyst,Gregory M. Spierkel,"And lastly, the last question from me is, obviously there is a lot of concern in the marketplace about the sub prime market and potential impact on the financial vertical as well as the broad retail and consumer verticals in aggregate. I know you have made a number of comments on North America in general but do you have a sense of if we look at those three areas in aggregate what kind of an exposure you guys might have as a percent of revenue in North America?","The housing sector clearly has thought we are going to have an impact on the psychology and with days like we just came through with the stock market today or this week for that matter, I don't think its going to help the outlook in the medium term or the short term quarter two out. But we have been fortunate in one sense, the Avid business which we haven't mentioned so far has been pretty solid for us in light of a soft marketplace, a home marketplace that is. So we are still growing at a healthy double-digit rate albeit a little lower than it was a year ago but its still very healthy and we review that pretty carefully which says the high end of the consumer market is still opening up their wallets and still providing us ample opportunity. But the more volumes in commoditized space I think is a bit more sensitive right now, and that's probably factoring in on the overall retail sector as we are selling into that sector.",,,,,,,,,
Jason Gursky,William D. Humes,"A couple of book keeping questions for Bill, CapEx was quite a bit lower this quarter than what it was last quarter, maybe just a little bit of an explanation as to why the slow down and what we ought to expect for the rest of the year? And then on the tax rate what you might expect for 2008?","Sure Jason, overall our total CapEx for the six months is about $24 million which is right along the lines of what we expected overall in our plan if you looked at our 10-K and previous year's disclosure. We talked about an expected up to $60 million in CapEx. And of course that... the amount of expenditures and what end [ph]... the timing is all dependant upon what you are buying and when. So... but I would still expect that this time that we should be within our overall expectations of the $60 million and if we are not we will tell you at that point in time but we are looking... we are tracking right along our expectations. And then your second question was what?",,,,,,,,,
Jason Gursky,Gregory M. Spierkel,Your tax rate for '08,"Overall it's at 27 for the rest of this year and I think 27 is probably a good rate to model for '08, of course as we get closer to '08 and we develop our own internal budgets and everything that will evolve based on the mix of businesses and other strategies we may implement but 27 is probably a good rate for now.",,,,,,,,,
Jason Gursky,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay and then just the follow up. Greg maybe just some qualitative commentary from you on what... where you think the demand in Europe is coming from, just kind of a currency driven phenomenon going on, was there some investment that is now getting caught up that wasn't being made over the past several quarters in the region. Just kind of why you think this demand is now starting to firm up a little bit over there?","That's a good question and it's interesting because about 3.5, 4 years ago we saw pretty good movement of the Euro versus the Dollar and that provided a bit of a catalyst. I think that there is some tailwind in the marketplace in Europe because of the currency situation. It's very hard to measure and know for sure but most components and products are US denominated in terms of cost level and clearly that means for a less or a lower priced Euro base product once it gets sold into that region. So I suspect that's helping, but I wouldn't have any tangible hard numbers to give to you, but we are seeing really in the last month or two some pretty positive signals from the demand and our own progress in most of the countries in Europe.
I think also you are getting a situation where Europe is seeing some real growth and a lot of people aren't seeing this yet, but we are hearing a lot of it. As a result of selling and servicing Eastern Europe much like the emerging markets of Asia, the 6 to 8 new countries of Central Europe and Russia are feeding an interesting new business opportunity in growth out of the supplying countries, which is Western Europe. And so there is an export phenomena, and as a result infrastructure spend to support a new business coming out of Eastern-Central Europe is I think helping Western Europe right now.
So I think those are the two kind of macro level factors that seem to be providing. What we see on a day-to-day basis, a more positive outlook right now than where we were three, four months ago.

Andrew Hargreaves,Gregory M. Spierkel,"I want to come back to the US real quick. It seems like the direct marketers were all seeing pretty strong growth. So do you think that's the situation where you are just exposed to some verticals that they are not for some reason, or are US VARs losing some share?","I think our VAR business still is relatively solid, and strong. Really it's more of the... it's really more the corporate space that we have seen relative... corporate and government space that we've seen have seen relative weakness in. But as we look at that space, because there is probably a lot of crossover in markets served, at least end markets served between the direct marketers and our VARs, that comparison is probably not too far off.",,,,,,,,,
Andrew Hargreaves,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay, can you give us... you mentioned consumer electronics in Europe, were you are taking about the private label business there?","No, actually private label components of that obviously included in what we are doing in consumer electronics but the comment was really a little bit broader against how we are continuing to expand our overall product portfolio on consumer electronics in Europe. Spain is like continuing to expand our offering of digital Cameras, of MP3 players, and even now getting into televisions as well. That's really... that was really the comment on consumer electronics.",,,,,,,,,
Andrew Hargreaves,William D. Humes,"Okay, okay thanks. And then just a little detail on the return on capital target, and I apologize if I missed this. But how much just qualitatively are you expecting to come from P&L improvement and how much from balance sheet changes, balance sheet improvement?","Hey Andy, this is Bill. I'd say that given where we are on working capital and the fact that we have essentially best in class working capital metrics, obviously that leads to the biggest portion of upside opportunity coming from operating margin improvement. So although I would say working capital of course is an area we will continue to focus on and probably can shave some of the ROIC increase out of that, the lion's share will come from operating margin improvement over the years.",,,,,,,,,
Ben Radinsky,William D. Humes,Thanks. It's Ben Radinsky from Bear Stearns. First a couple of housekeeping questions. What was the translation impact in Asia-Pacific; do you have that handy?,"Hey, Ben, it's Bill. It just wasn't... it wasn't material. And so the large amount of the Asia-Pacific growth was really organic, the Asia-Pacific currency strength and you didn't have a material impact on that growth.",,,,,,,,,
Ben Radinsky,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay. And then what was the... if you pro formaed revenue for warranty expense, what would sales have been for the warranty changed?","You will hear on our release and other things, it had about a 5 percentage point impacts on the year-over-year growth for North America and roughly a 2 percentage impacts on the overall worldwide growth on a year-over-year basis.",,,,,,,,,
Ben Radinsky,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay. And then when will the SEC charge be finalized, you have an estimate for that?","Don't have an estimate. We have... as we've said in our July 2 notice on this, we've been in discussions with the SEC, we believe we've assessed the right figure and impact that this should have on the Company. It's up to them to come back to us in the coming months and that's really something that's not under our schedule. It's really determined by their pace of workload and everything else and case load that they have. So we're sitting on the sideline and we have done everything we feel that we can at this stage.",,,,,,,,,
Ben Radinsky,Gregory M. Spierkel,"Okay. And then the last one is, can you just give a little color on DBL? Is that... I know that that's much more retail oriented than Avid is but can you talk about qualitatively what the margin structure is there and does is fit in with the Avid strategy or is it really a separate silo?","Okay, I think it's a good compliment overall to our consumer electronics strategy and when you take a look at the overall CE market what we've done in particular here in North America is really rounded out that offering with DBS. We've got out of it on the very high end home theater. We have got a lot of product in the IT and CE convergence space to our core Ingram Micro business.
DBL really does provide... I guess... provides us with I guess a couple of things: number one is it does fill in a lot of the accessories part of the CE offerings, some related to convergence, some not. And in addition to that it also brings us a lot of strength and independent retail. So it's a good mix, it's a good compliment to what we already have in product line. I think it's a great compliment in terms of the customer sets we are able to address and operating margins we didn't talk specifically about but as with the other adjacent businesses we've looked at obviously we are looking at net new markets that offer us with higher margin businesses both on the gross margin as well as operating margin lines.
