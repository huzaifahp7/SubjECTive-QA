Matthew Galinko,Michael Edenfield,"So I guess in terms of your deal pipeline, I know you've been talking about some pretty healthy pipeline in the last couple of quarters. So I'm just curious how that played out versus your expectations and kind of versus how things have closed historically? Are there deals still lingering, and if there's any hesitation, why is there? And then lastly, how is that factoring into the conversation now, is it being decided early in the decision-making process or is it coming down to the wire that people decide how they are deploying the product?","It seems to be a pretty good selling environment, particularly when you have a new platform coming in like SaaS. It stimulates demand. But still, it's not going 100% for us so far, and we kind of like having a mixed mode to tell you the truth, but it's really we focus on what the customer wants. If they want perpetual, we love to work with them. If they want SaaS, we love to work with them. So the great thing is that we have platforms to do both.",,,,,,
Matthew Galinko,Michael Edenfield,Got you. And you mentioned the selling environment being pretty healthy. Can you just go over some of the macro events? Obviously there's some stuff going on in the U.K. today and then of course in the job report a few weeks ago it was a little bit tepid and the Fed backed off of their plans and got a little more cautious in their language. So do you feel anything around those events or do you feel anything in the macro environment that has you at all concerned?,"We're concerned even if everything is great. But no, we think we're in pretty good shape, but obviously if something serious happens in the macro environment, we'd be concerned, but no, we don't really see – we see a good situation right now. When a new platform comes out, a lot of people want to get on it. So it stimulates buying, and that's what SaaS is doing.",,,,,,
Matthew Galinko,Michael Edenfield,"Got you. Maybe one more question about SaaS. License has clearly moved around a little bit I think maybe exiting last year. If you look at the full year license fees, we've made a [modest thaw in it] [ph] especially given the pickup in the cloud ACV in the last year, maybe that would be shifting a little more towards cloud demand and it seems like license came in quite a bit stronger this year. So I'm just curious, as you look out, do you see it getting a little bit stronger on the SaaS side or do you think it's still primarily something that people want to consume as a deployed or premise license product?",I think it's not 100% one way and 0% the other but it's not being adopted by some of our larger customers. They might want to have a private SaaS but not a public SaaS or they might just go with the old perpetual – not old but the perpetual pricing. So the good thing about it is there is demand for both and we have options for both.,,,,,,
Kevin Liu,Michael Edenfield,"Just was hoping you guys could provide a little bit more color on the contributors to the strong license growth in the period, specifically wondering if there were any large deals over $1 million that perhaps contributed a lot of that or if you were seeing pretty broad-based strength? And then also just wanted to know whether you were seeing more demand for kind of the Logility platform versus some of the retail offerings that you have?","It was primarily the supply chain systems and we did have one over $1 million, one deal over $1 million in license.",,,,,,
Kevin Liu,Michael Edenfield,Got it. And just how would you kind of compare the demand right now as kind of the lower-end versus the higher-end enterprises? Are you seeing the Demand Management platform start to rebound a bit here and whereas most of that strength is on the high-end large enterprises?,"The way it's working out, and [indiscernible] this is, Demand Management, while they compete for perpetual deals and win them, it's more of a midmarket type thing. But what they are really positioned well for is SaaS in the small and medium space. They've got a great platform on Azure. It's a one-click update, multi-tenant. And so their license fees aren't as big as usual but they have and they're going to end up I think eventually having much more SaaS than perpetual. And on the high end, we can do some very big SaaS deals and we already have some nice SaaS deals, but most of the deals want to be perpetual so far with cloud services where we will maintain the system for them. So it's SaaS but it's not a multi-tenant SaaS. It's private SaaS.",,,,,,
Kevin Liu,Michael Edenfield,"Understood. And as you look at your pipeline heading into fiscal 2017, between the strong quarter of bookings you just had versus what you had [sitting into] [ph] the quarter, how do you feel you are set up now for continued license growth in the current year?","I didn't hear the first part of the question, Kevin.",,,,,,
Kevin Liu,Michael Edenfield,Just wondering if your pipeline is robust heading into fiscal 2017 and supportive of continued growth on the license side?,"Yes, I think it is. We've already had a sizable deal closed, and first quarter is the toughest quarter for us, but we're off to a good start.",,,,,,
Kevin Liu,Vincent C. Klinges,"Okay. And lastly for me, just with the return of some of the higher license growth levels you've seen in recent quarters, what are your hiring plans like as we head into the current fiscal year?",This is Vince. We actually – at Voyager level of the high-end product we actually are at 21 dedicated salespeople. That's up from 14 this time last year. So that's a pretty big percentage increase for the Company. So we do plan to incrementally grow that from here but we're going to try to see the fruits of that increase of people this year first.,,,,,,
