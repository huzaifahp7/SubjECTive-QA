Brian W. Nagel,J. Paul Raines,"So my first question, just want to dive a little deeper into the used margin in the quarter. you gave some commentary in your prepared remarks, but just want to understand the mechanics. Is the pressure of the margin, does that come as you're making -- as you're actually taking these trade-ins? Or does it come when you subsequently sell that product? And then the decision to get more aggressive on, I guess, on the trade-in effort, was that planned ahead of time? Or was it potentially a response to maybe something you've seen in the competitive environment?","Let me start off with sort of the plans and then Rob should go through some of the map on used margin rate. But then Tony may have some comments for you, Brian. I mean, we've -- one of the things that's very important to us is to have high share on these consoles. Our company has been through several of these. We know the importance of the cycle. So going back over a year, we have wanted to maximize trying to get more allocation every day from the console makers. For that reason, we have been focused on trade promotion for quite a while here, trying to get people into our reservation file and our first-to-know list. So I would say this has been something we've been going at a while. And as shared data becomes more apparent, we have to let Sony and Microsoft lead on that, but I think investors will see how dominant GameStop truly is on these launches. And that's really been going on for a while. A reaction, really not much of a reaction here. You really can't react short term, Tony, fair to say?",,,,,,,,,

Or was it potentially a response to maybe something you've seen in the competitive environment?","Yes, the consoles were formally announced at E3 in the beginning of June, at which point, GameStop started to take reservations. That's an earlier process than we've ever had before in terms of reservations toward new consoles. We've never had that much lead time. We were, as Paul and Tony said, aggressive about our trade programs. So what you start to see is the inflow of inventory with the trade offers that we were making, and then over the course of time through the third quarter, you start to see that inventory turn around and flow out in terms of sales. That impacts the margin rate. So the margin rate, in of itself, would not change based upon what flows in and is in our inventory. It's when it starts to sell through that you see that. And so it's not, again, just something that we started this quarter or wasn't started in reaction to what we were seeing in terms of trends. We went out of the gates, very aggressive in terms of driving reservations on the consoles. The trade-in program was a big part of that process, and we continued through the last 5 months to be aggressive on driving reservations because we want that allocation from the publisher -- or the console makers.",,,,,,,,,
Brian W. Nagel,Robert A. Lloyd,"Got it. And then so as a follow-up to that, Rob, you mentioned in your prepared comments, it was, I think -- correct me if I'm wrong. You said in the fourth quarter, you should see that used margin snap back to the more -- the normal levels. So does that then suggest you're going to -- you're changing the prices, which you take trade-ins or you work through the inventory? Or basically, how should we think about the puts and takes of that?","Well, again, as we've always said about our pre-owned inventory program, we have control of the buy side and the sell side pricing on that. So as far as what we do going forward, it'll be a combination of both of those levers, if you will, that will have us return more to the normal range that we've always had.",,,,,,,,,

Brian W. Nagel,J. Paul Raines,I just have one more question. I'll turn it over to someone else. But you've taken a lot of trade-in from the pre-owned -- on the pre-owned machines in anticipation of the launches of the new machines. How should we think about that relative -- in conjunction with kind of the weaker sales and use that?,"Maybe you want to say we, certainly, have a lot of faith in the used business in a new console cycle. Maybe, Mike Hogan, you want to share what the history tells us about pre-owned in a new cycle?",,,,,,,,,

But you've taken a lot of trade-in from the pre-owned -- on the pre-owned machines in anticipation of the launches of the new machines. How should we think about that relative -- in conjunction with kind of the weaker sales and use that?,"Sure, I think one of the things we've seen in the past is that with each introduction of a new console, pre-owned growth actually accelerates post that. And one of the reasons is because it provides a great value, right? These are going to be very attractively priced systems and practically priced games, and so in anticipation of that growth, we think that the opportunity to get some additional inventory is a great thing. So we think that will help speed the growth coming.",,,,,,,,,

Those folks, not all of them, can afford a brand-new console, and they will buy used to participate in the category.",,,,,,,,,
Colin A. Sebastian,J. Paul Raines,"A quick follow-up on the pre-owned margin questions, it sounds like there's a cyclical element to this. And I think I asked about this in the last call, but why wouldn't it be logical to assume that the pre-owned margins remain a bit lower for a period of time at least just given the mix shift to higher-value next-gen software where maybe that having both sides of the trade doesn't give you as much flexibility? And then secondly, Paul, back to the comments on technology retail and leveraging your assets, that brings up the point of Simply Mac, which I don't think you mentioned in the script. But curious if there's any interest in acquiring the remainder of that company. And then more broadly, if you can talk about synergies beyond the back office between GameStop, Spring, Aio and Simply Mac, perhaps sharing footprint or floor space or anything like that.","Maybe, Rob, do you want to -- or you and Mike want to talk about the cyclicality of the margin rate? I'm not -- the one comment I would make on it, Colin, is it's all about the consumer size. It's not a fixed consumer base. People come into the category as it drives innovation, and that plays a big role. But anything you want to add to that?",,,,,,,,,

You're going to see that the newer stuff is going to -- by that, I mean these consoles that are just now launching and the related software, you're going to see that, that business is going to grow over time, but predominantly, it's going to be driven by what's already happening and what trades are coming in on the last gen, PS3 and Xbox 360. So we're not giving guidance for 2014 yet, but based on history, we still expect to operate preowned within the parameters of what we always have.",,,,,,,,,

And in fact, Steve Bain and the team from Simply opened up their 19th and 20th stores this weak. I think it's Missoula, Montana and Lubbock, Texas. So any investors who are based in those cities, you'll have a beautiful Simply Mac store to go shop. As far as synergies, we mentioned them. We see ourselves as having built this platform that includes real estate, talent management and training, buy-sell-trade, PowerUp Rewards and capital and many others. As far as the real estate synergies, there are multiple synergies. Marc Summey, our Senior VP of real estate, has identified a real long list of targets and locations where we have adjacent opportunities on the same pad, in the same mall. If you go to Shreveport today, you'll see that the GameStop and Simply Mac are very close. If you go to some of our other locations, you'll see that we're leveraging our landlord relationships. So it's very early, and yes, it is a -- there is a significant real estate opportunity between the Aio, Spring Mobile and Simply Mac businesses with GameStop.",,,,,,,,,
Michael J. Olson,J. Paul Raines,"There was some discussion earlier about the relationship between new and used sales at the beginning of a console cycle. And I think in the last cycle, you saw pre-owned sales increase by something like more than 20% in the first couple of years of the cycle. Is there anything different about this cycle or anything you can say about what we should expect for pre-owned growth as we look into 2014 and '15?","Yes, let's let Mike take you through some of his thoughts on that because he's done a lot of modeling. I would also encourage you to remember that PowerUp Rewards is a bit of a game changer on this, and it's demonstrated some really different behaviors in terms of our ability to gain share of wallet. But Mike, you want to talk about that?",,,,,,,,,

Is there anything different about this cycle or anything you can say about what we should expect for pre-owned growth as we look into 2014 and '15?","Sure, I think, yes, we've talked about this before. If you go back and look at the last several -- if you look at the last several launches, we had a situation where, obviously, as the consumers trade in to the new console, they're trading in their old games. And so we do see -- I don't know if we see cyclicality and margin rates, but we certainly see cyclicality in terms of demand. And so what we would be expecting is a fairly large quantity of consoles and games flowing in as consumers trade up to new, and we think that provides a great opportunity for us to offer a great value for new consumers. As Paul mentioned earlier, we're trading up to a 360 or to a PS3. So although we -- I don't think we've given out any sort of specific numbers, we certainly feel very optimistic about the opportunity to draw more consumers into the category with preowned. We think there's great opportunity to offer great value, and we would expect to see an acceleration of growth.",,,,,,,,,

Is there anything different about this cycle or anything you can say about what we should expect for pre-owned growth as we look into 2014 and '15?","Yes, and remember that we've always said the used business is an opening price point business. Because video gaming has this map pricing, we often don't think of it as an assortment of good, better, best because there's just one price on new software. But what GameStop created years ago is the opening price point business. And so there are consumers who will emerge, who are opening price point consumers, who love the idea of console gaming but don't have the money for a brand-new copy and a brand-new console. So that's the dynamic that will play out over the next couple of years.",,,,,,,,,
Michael J. Olson,J. Paul Raines,"Okay. And then are you experiencing more mobile competition that could impact that business? I know there continues to be some new entrants in the space from time to time. Were you pressured to do more aggressive promotions there, which may have impacted mobile margins because of more competition in the space? Or were you just doing them to kind of drive share gains?","I'll let Tony -- Tony runs that business for us but I would -- one comment I would make about the mobile business is we were early in that. There are a lot of new entrants into it, but we continue to be uniquely positioned in terms of our retail footprint and our refurbishment capabilities. And our play is how do we continue to leverage that and bundle it with video game promotions. But Tony, you want to talk about mobile promotions and trades and so forth?",,,,,,,,,

I know there continues to be some new entrants in the space from time to time. Were you pressured to do more aggressive promotions there, which may have impacted mobile margins because of more competition in the space? Or were you just doing them to kind of drive share gains?","Yes, absolutely. I think the #1 issue that we continue to face is awareness of that. So new entrants actually drive awareness of the overall business, and that's a very positive thing for GameStop. So we did not see an increased amount of discounting in that. We did -- as Rob mentioned earlier, we were very aggressive on the trade side of the business. But we see it as a very complementary business. We see it does bring in some new customers, but a lot of the customers that do come in and buy mobile are the same customers that are coming in. Obviously, we wanted to build inventory for the large amount of holiday traffic that we expect as we sell a lot of new consoles this holiday season. So we feel like we're well poised for that.",,,,,,,,,
Arvind Bhatia,Robert A. Lloyd,"Just a couple of questions here, guys. One, I wanted to see if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing in tie ratios for the PlayStation 4 so far and maybe compare that to what you saw early on either for the 360 or the PlayStation 3. And then also, the 20% to 30% industry growth guidance you guys -- or not guidance but how you guys think about the industry for next year, is there any change in your thought process? Are you guys more comfortable with that kind of number as you now have more visibility? And then I have a follow-up.","Yes, I think it's a little bit early for us to talk about tie ratios. I think we're pleased with what we see so far. It's just been a week on the Sony side and of course, Xbox tonight. So I think we'll have more color around that when we talk about our -- or when we release our holiday results I think.",,,,,,,,,

But one thing to look at, we've been saying for a while that these consoles will include a lot more digital content than any previous console, and that's played out with PlayStation. If you were in our stores the other night for the PS4 launch, you saw that we were aggressively marketing a lot of digital content and network access. But that's going to be a big part of Sony's future. That network is going to grow significantly. Tony, any color you want to add to that?",,,,,,,,,

We're working very closely with Sony to make sure that we partner with them and giving them the consumer feedback and working closely to make sure that we have a great product there. But our associates, part of their training was to make sure that when people opened that product up or as people went to use it, they were -- had a great experience. So what we saw is that when you look at the all of the PlayStation Plus subscriptions that we've sold in our lifetime as a company, and we've been selling them for years, the full 1/3 of all subscriptions we've sold in our lifetime were sold in the last 7 days at GameStop. So that shows you the strength of attach that was over 1/3 of the products went out with attach on that, and that's growing daily as we have customers coming back into our stores on a daily basis to pick up PlayStation Plus, so...",,,,,,,,,

The last iteration we had, we were projecting between 20% and 30% console category growth in the U.S. for next year, for 2014. The model's built from a number of different sources. It takes into account a lot of different variables. What I will say is that the limited amount of data that we have here because it hasn't been very long, is certainly positive and consistent with what our expectations are. At the time we built the model, we have projected a new console cycle that's slightly smaller than last one. We were being conservative to account for things like the effect that the Wii had in the last cycle, right? Just include things like handhelds and preowned and so on. So our category model right now we'll probably be updating it some time after the first of the year, but all the data we have right now is pretty consistent with what our expectations were 2 months ago.",,,,,,,,,
Arvind Bhatia,J.

I just wanted to see if you guys have any thoughts on how you see the full picture for the quarter, meaning you have the $9.99 upgrade program, when we combine existing gen and next-gen sales of some of the big properties this holiday quarter, how you see the trend.","Yes. Tony will talk a little bit about what he's doing with trades and all. I would just say that there's a lot of noise in the business right now. We're launching Xbox One tonight. There's a lot of customers. I talk to a lot of gamers, a lot of gamers trying to make decisions. They have so many options. So there's a little bit of noise in the system.

And we knew that coming in, so that's why we have the $9.99 trade offers, and those have been very successful for us. And it's a unique way for us to sell. So we'll continue to do that. I would add to what Paul said, there's distance on exactly, which console they're going to play it on, and I think that's going to sort itself out in the next couple of weeks, as people see the flow of consoles and see how strong the demand is for these 2 consoles.",,,,,,,,,

Curtis Nagle,Tony D. Bartel,"Just one question and a quick follow-up. Frankly, I was pretty surprised by the amount of leverage you guys got in the quarter. Of course, sales were quite good, but just on the dollar basis, they virtually were unchanged given a very big increase in sales. And just was wondering what the puts and takes were and kind of how we should think about leverage going into 4Q. And then just a follow-up, I was curious why digital sales weren't stronger just given the number of AAA titles, particularly GTA that sold and the high attach rates that go with them. So if you could comment that -- on that, it'd be very much appreciated.","Sure. On the digital sales, you even mentioned GTA V, which was, by far, the largest title on the quarter. GTA V did not actually have a day and date digital component to it, which we clearly had anticipated with it when we last spoke that, that would. And so that's really deferred because there's clearly -- and we clearly anticipated the digital content will come out on that and will participate in that. So that's more deferred revenue. And I would say that was probably one of the stronger elements of the lower digital growth that took place. But like we said, the new consoles, we do anticipate that they will be more digital, and so we feel like our digital sales will expand ...",,,,,,,,,

We've kind of said all along that you get a great opportunity to leverage your cost base when you're in a console launch. The same thing applies although to a slightly lesser extent on a title launch when you think of something like the magnitude of the Grand Theft Auto. You're not going to staff the store exactly the same as you would on a normal Wednesday, but you're going to staff to make sure the customer experience is appropriate when you're open for midnight. But then you start to think about the flow-through of the hundreds of people in line at a store to get a Grand Theft Auto and then the number of people that are in line at the store to get these launches that we're going through right now, and you really have a fantastic opportunity to leverage the cost structure. So I'm glad you noticed that. We work very hard to make sure that we're positioned to get the best that we can out of the leverage when we have these opportunities.",,,,,,,,,
Anthony C. Chukumba,J. Paul Raines,"Just wanted to probe a little bit into the Q4 guidance because it looked -- it just struck me as very, very conservative. I mean, particularly on the comp, 2% to 9%, I mean, you're going to be selling a ton of these PlayStation 4 and Xbox Ones at $300, $400. And so I guess, I'm just trying to dig a little bit into that because, like I said, I definitely get the mix in terms of the margins and obviously, the consoles are significantly lower margin. But I guess, that just struck me as conservative, particularly from a comp perspective.","Yes. Rob will give you some detail. I mean, we are -- the fourth quarter, there's lots of movement, there are some title shifts. There's 53, 52 week. We did launch the Wii U last year. It was a pretty successful launch. So there's a few things there. Rob, maybe you want to give him some detail -- Anthony some detail on how you model Q4.",,,,,,,,,

But the -- we know exactly what's sitting in our stores, but the visibility into what our allocations are going to be for the rest of the quarter are -- that's pretty cloudy right now. So we wanted to make sure that we had a comp range to start with that reflected the unknown surrounding that. And then we wanted to make sure that we weren't overreaching in the expectation that we put on the console makers for what they're able to deliver to the system and specifically to us.",,,,,,,,,
Anthony C. Chukumba,Robert A. Lloyd,"Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, sort of related, just to clarify the -- you're assuming 118 million diluted shares outstanding for Q4. So that essentially assumes that you don't repurchase any stock in Q4? Is that correct?","As is typical, when we give guidance, we base it on the share count that calculates off the quarter we just completed. So that's consistent, yes.",,,,,,,,,

Lloyd,"Okay, and then -- I mean, but just based on the fact you just re-upped your share repurchase program, there's no reason to think that you wouldn't buy back stock in Q4. I mean, is there?","Well, no, we're committed to the buyback program. Re-upping the authorization is, obviously, a symbol of that. However, as we go into a quarter given what the price might do and there's been some volatility in it this year, it's tough for us to predict exactly what we might buy in terms of share count. So our practice has been, over the course of the past 3 years, just to base it on what we know has been completed.",,,,,,,,,

Paul Raines,"Okay, and then -- I mean, but just based on the fact you just re-upped your share repurchase program, there's no reason to think that you wouldn't buy back stock in Q4. I mean, is there?","Yes, that's a standard practice Rob and the team take. I would also point out that we've been very consistent and are very committed to the share buyback program. Rob, bought back a whole bunch of shares this quarter, and we like the characteristics of our program so far.",,,,,,,,,
David G. Magee,J. Paul Raines,"The interest in the new consoles is very encouraging and the -- I guess, the discounts that we also have attached to it versus the last cycle launch may not have been warranted. I'm curious, as you look out 6 to 9 months from now, when you get through this initial gamer-centric demand, how do you feel about the visibility of the console demand at that point in time past the initial rush? Are you feeling better about that at this point? Or it's just hard to say?","Mike is going to give you some modeling sort of stuff. I would just tell you plain, the PS4, you can't help but think about the innovation level in that device as being around for a long time. Just all the social features, you stream PlayStation live, all that stuff is really compelling. Mike -- that's just an anecdotal qualitative kind of thing. But Mike, what do you want to share with about that?",,,,,,,,,

Are you feeling better about that at this point? Or it's just hard to say?","Yes, I think to that point, we've actually modeled the PS4 and Xbox One. Yes, in our model, they were modeled less and less but pretty close. I think one of the reasons why the total number was down had more to do with the performance of the Wii. But everything we're seeing to this point is very, very positive. I think we made the point earlier what PowerUp Rewards does is allow us to go inside and see what consumers are doing. It would be -- obviously, it would be a mistake to take the number of PowerUp members and literally multiply it by the percentage. But when -- anytime you're seeing a base of 25 million, 26 million people and you're seeing a very, very high percentage, 2/3 have been indicating very positive purchase interest, what it says to us is that the demand is very strong, and it's going to take a long time for the supply to catch up with that demand. So I think everything we're seeing suggests very, very strong demand not only now but for a very long period of time. Keep in mind that 26 million people in the program, a lot of those people are not just core gamers, right? We have a very, very broad segment of the population in there. And then I think another point that Tony mentioned earlier is value. One of the things that we think is going to be a big deal is our ability to make the systems through our trade programs affordable for millions of people who couldn't otherwise afford them. So between the demand, the ability to provide value and hopefully, a strong lineup of new titles coming out next year, we think there's a number of things that can continue to make the console demand strong for the foreseeable future.",,,,,,,,,

Okay. With that, I believe we're at our time limit. We'll wrap that up. Thank you for your support of GameStop. We look forward to seeing everyone in our stores at holiday, and power to the players.",,,,,,,,,
