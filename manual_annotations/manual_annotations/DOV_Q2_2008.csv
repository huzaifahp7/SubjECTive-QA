Wendy B. Caplan,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Could we talk a little bit about the book-to-bill in the segment? Looks like Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies still above 1, but the other two segments look a little weaker. Notably Engineered Systems, which I am guessing is from the Engineer Products lumpiness. But if you could kind of expand on, on that those two segments' book-to-bill, please.","Wendy if I might, just to kind of put this into reference, again our orders were up year-over-year by about 6%. The trade of those orders were very similar to last year in terms of kind of where they hit. But the segments you talked about were the weaker of the four. However, that's not totally untraditional. Some of that's a reaction to some of the changes that Wal-Mart is bringing into the marketplace, as well as the Belvac which is certainly seeing a different hand making opportunity this year versus past year. That's just more of a market change of opportunities. Those are project-related businesses.",,,,,,,,,
Wendy B. Caplan,Robert A. Livingston,"Could we talk a little bit about the book-to-bill in the segment? Looks like Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies still above 1, but the other two segments look a little weaker. Notably Engineered Systems, which I am guessing is from the Engineer Products lumpiness. But if you could kind of expand on, on that those two segments' book-to-bill, please.","Wendy, this is Bob. At Engineered Products platform, our book-to-bill for the second quarter was 0.97. And as Ron mentioned, the real significant decrease year-over-year was at Belvac, and that's just we're just in a down cycle right now, and sort of a multi-year project phase that some of their customers go through. A little bit of a negative comparison at Hill Phoenix, for year-over-year, that again, mostly due to the decline of new store construction at Wal-Mart. And the rest of the businesses in that group held up fairly well.",,,,,,,,,
Terry Darling,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Thanks. Wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see changing on three items for the second half of the year, that you've addressed that sort of implicitly a bit first, on organic growth, 5.5% or so, this quarter, very strong. Looks like on a book-to-bill, we ought to see that pullback a bit. And then wondered if you could also talk about this raw material price, continuing into the second half. You're being cautious on it. Is that just based on the macro factors? Or do you have some visibility on that, continue getting tougher for you?","Kind of addressing each of those questions, certainly from an organic growth standpoint, we've identified that we forecast 4 to 5% organic growth through the remainder of the year. There's not a lot of acquisitions that we did in the end of '07 that will fuel acquisition growth. So we still feel pretty good about that number. I would also say that referring to, back to our book to bill I think, we kind of covered it fairly well in the last comments but there wasn't anything significant in the market that really caused us to see a significant change in business level. We were up year-over-year. We continue to feel very strong about the oil market. We continue to believe their product ID is going to hold up well. Electronics certainly has a nice comeback in the quarter where we would like to think that we'll see some of that hold up, but that's always a bit of a variable market. But we still feel pretty good about the economy right now. Terry, it's been a pretty strong year so far. Racking the raw material prices, I think we've done a number of things to prepare our companies to be less a more proactive as it relates to the raw material pricing and kind of how we handle that. We did a lot of moves of our companies to Mexico to other Eastern block companies to increase our presence in Asia over the last couple of years. There was cost associated with that. I think we are getting the benefit of that now. I think our companies have internal initiatives on synergy. They are making it more efficient and then I think we are doing a much better job of analyzing the real value we bring to our customers and appropriately pricing through that. And I think those things in total have caused us to offset majority of our raw material price increases year-to-date.",,,,,,,,,
Terry Darling,Ronald L. Hoffman,"And then just a quick modeling question. Can you talk about the sequential increase in net interest expense and the year-over-year decline in free cash flow, and what you are expecting on interest expense and free cash flow on the back half of the year?","Yes, from an interest expense, it was really just driven by probably a more accelerated share purchase than we originally laid out. So that dropped our net debt up about $0.5 billion. And the difference in the interest expense is the delta effect. And what was the second half of your question?",,,,,,,,,
Terry Darling,Paul E. Goldberg,And working capital as a percentage of sales was actually down year-over-year. So what am I missing there?,"Well, if you look at it, when we started the share repurchase program, if you go back exactly a year, we hadn't done any real significant share repurchase. We really started in earnest in August of last year. So that a pretty hefty amount of share repurchase in a relatively short time. And from a free cash flow perspective, we had very strong free cash flow in the first quarter and the second quarter was relatively strong. So on a comparable basis, we are up 29% year-to-date over last year.",,,,,,,,,
Alexander M. Blanton,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Good morning. I wonder if you could give us a flavor for the trends geographically, what your potential exposure is to Europe, which is weakening in many countries and how much benefit you might be getting from strength in Asia and Latin America?","Alex, that is always very company specific and market specific. But I think we have a slide in our deck that shows our growth rate year-to-date. And the majority of our growth has come in Asia; that's been electronically driven. Plus, the other companies that we have that have strong Asian presence such as Knowles and others. Europe for us was actually up from a growth rate standpoint this year over last. Again, we have some businesses performing well there. Imaje, our product ID company certainly is located in Europe. SWEP [ph] has had a very good run in its heat exchanger business in Europe and we continue to see radar continues [ph] to build. They opened a new plant in China during the quarter. So they will... that will be increasing their international presence. So across the board, pretty good global engagement here. I know a lot of people are talking about Europe pulling back. Our rate of growth in Europe has kind of held in there fairly well. In fact, DE-STA-CO, which serves the automotive market in general is down certainly in U.S. The project with Audio and VW or Volkswagen in Europe have continued to keep that business quite active.",,,,,,,,,
Alexander M. Blanton,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Okay. A second question is on the corporate SG&A. It was up about 74 basis points year-over-year and that hurt... well, there may have been a good reasons for that. But had it not been up, it would have added 0.06 or $0.07 to the earnings per share. So could you give us the reason for that? Is it a product mix change or is it additional spending of some kind or what?","We've had... Alex, this is Rob Kuhbach... we've had somewhat higher professional fees and we had to make some adjustments in our contingency reserves. We don't expect that to continue. The second quarter was somewhat higher than we expect, and I would say we've adjusted our overall annual corporate spend rate. If you look in the outlook stage on the slide, we head up [ph] slightly from probably a total of $5 million from where it was at the end of the first quarter. I would say the lion's share of that is some consulting fees that we've been engaged in. And part of that relates to our integration process planning and the overall business improvement process. Some of that we have absorbed at the corporate level rather than run it through the individual operating company. So I would say it's largely professional fees.",,,,,,,,,
Alexander M. Blanton,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Yes, what was that number you just referred to?","If you look in our slide, we have an outlook on corporate expenses, and we've raised the estimated year... full year number by roughly $5 million.",,,,,,,,,
Alexander M. Blanton,Robert G. Kuhbach,But that's already been taking is what you are saying?,What I'm saying is the lion's share of it we think has been absorbed in the second quarter delta.,,,,,,,,,
Scott Davis,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Maybe tough question to answer, but given that you are 95% FIFO accounting, Rob, do you have a feel for either, A, how much that kind of helped you on a price cost basis this quarter or B, maybe how far behind the price cost curve... I mean I know that buys you a little bit of time to raise prices from an accounting perspective. But how much pressure does that put on you for 3Q to really get prices in?","I would say the impact on Dover... first of all, not a lot of our companies are actually on FIFO or a little more on [ph] LIFO. So we don't have the same... the other way around... I am sorry. So we don't have as much of an impact as companies that are entirely on that system. But I would say that our ability to manage through exercise is very high. We don't expect that to have much of an impact for the quarter or the rest of the year.",,,,,,,,,
Scott Davis,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Okay, good. And when you talked about Electronics really had a nice positive surprise this quarter, and that begs the question when you look at the book-to-bill, was there any kind of pull forward of business ahead of announced price increases that you are aware of?
","I would say in general that we didn't see any significant... I mean, obviously, pricing has been going on all year and will continue to go on. I don't think there is anything significant that you record. It's immeasurable if there has been any impact at all.",,,,,,,,,
Scott Davis,Robert A. Livingston,Okay. Last question on Paladin. It's... can you give us an indication of the rate of change? Is it still negative? Have we stabilized at all at lower levels or are we still going down?,"Well, I would... certainly, the demolishment recycling market of Paladin has continue to hold strong. That's been really the highlight of that marketplace. The utility business within Paladin has really performed well. Heavy construction, light construction certainly has been down. We don't anticipate any significant change or improvement in that through the course of the year. I would also point out, though, Scott, even with those challenges, we have been doing significant things behind the scene to improve our cost base in that business. We have also been seeking greater synergies among our companies. We have closed some plants to streamline the business, and that business was a double-digit margin business in the second quarter.",,,,,,,,,
Steve Tusa,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Just on the outlook. When I look at your normal seasonality from the second to the third quarter, you usually have somewhat of a bump up there, maybe 5 to 6% growth quarter-over-quarter. Is there anything you're seeing out there in the near term that would throw you off your... the normal seasonality?","I think you're comment on seasonality is directionally somewhat right, Steve. It's very historical. I would think the peaks in values [ph] of that may be somewhat muted and it will be a little flatter as we look at where we are at compared to the remainder of the year. Not a lot of seasonal impact probably from second to third quarter.",,,,,,,,,
Steve Tusa,Ronald L. Hoffman,Is there anything out there? Is it... is that raw materials-related? Is it just the change in the portfolio? Is there something going on at oil and gas that slows down... that drives that?,"No, there is nothing of seasonality about oil and gas. Typically, the things that would come to play there is if you have a real rainy season that takes people out of the market or allows them not to get into certain fields. But I would say, we don't anticipate any seasonality issues. We do get into some construction issues that might impact new store constructions or things that would impact like with Hill PHOENIX, or it might impact our PDQ building, some of their involvement or even stations that OPW might serve. But not a lot of that Steve; it's going to be highly intensive quarter-to-quarter. It's really... there is nothing out there that I would put my finger on at the moment, any of our sectors that we look at and fret about really to seasonality for the remainder of the year.",,,,,,,,,
Steve Tusa,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. And then one more question just on the 12% plus growth guidance. That's on the new continuing ops number, correct? So as Crenlo comes back into the fold, that adds a few pennies?","Well I think what we've done, Steve, is if you recall, last quarter as we did the guidance, we said 12% plus on the number that we have at that time. I think there is a 4% or... excuse me, a 2% change year-to-date. Certainly, that should be added to the numbers... $0.02, I'm sorry. Paul, do you have anything to add on that [ph]?",,,,,,,,,
Steve Tusa,Paul E. Goldberg,"Okay. And then one more question just on the 12% plus growth guidance. That's on the new continuing ops number, correct? So as Crenlo comes back into the fold, that adds a few pennies?","Yes, just to clarify it a little bit Steve, the guidance that we're still holding to our guidance, which was off the 3.22 of last year and it is appropriate to add in $0.04 to this year for the Triton Crenlo discontinuation... re-continuation, for lack of a better word.",,,,,,,,,
Steve Tusa,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. And then one more question just on the 12% plus growth guidance. That's on the new continuing ops number, correct? So as Crenlo comes back into the fold, that adds a few pennies?","Steve, one other clarification. You should anticipate that the third and fourth quarters will be more balanced as opposed to what you are talked about the sourcing on the seasonality.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Good morning. Ron, I echo [ph] your sentiments. So on the just as the clarification, so the $0.04 of contribution from the impact of Crenlo and Triton. So Triton was... I think, it was just kind of breaking even. So the $0.04, is that really the way to look at a penny of contribution from Crenlo? Is that per quarter, is that the way to think about it?","I think last year, when we looked at last year Triton had a significant loss and so in effect, Crenlo, so this year we are accounting as the penny a quarter. If you look at it as the price of Crenlo standalone, it would be more like $0.02 a quarter.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Paul E. Goldberg,"Good morning. Ron, I echo [ph] your sentiments. So on the just as the clarification, so the $0.04 of contribution from the impact of Crenlo and Triton. So Triton was... I think, it was just kind of breaking even. So the $0.04, is that really the way to look at a penny of contribution from Crenlo? Is that per quarter, is that the way to think about it?","I just want to qualify. Triton was losing money at the beginning of last year. But as we exited last year, Triton was, in fact, making money. So just swapping out Crenlo and Triton it's just an incremental $0.01 per quarter going forward.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Paul E. Goldberg,"But if you... Paul, if you look at 2008, Triton wasn't really losing money, right? It was... you get...","No, they were.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Robert A. Livingston,"Okay. So then I want to go back to Bob's point about how kind of rise in pricing pretty much broke even in the quarter. Yet if you look at the Engineered Systems and the Industrial Products businesses, they didn't have as good leverage, and kind of some of the implications is maybe some about was the impact of raws. But you're saying that's not... that's the case. Is that the way to look at it?","But even if we were to able to do a 100% pass-through of material cost into pricing or offset it with hedging, the impact of that is you get it doesn't benefit you with respect to leverage. That's just the way the math works. The difference between the two segments, and I'll speak specifically to Engineered Systems, is that even though we had some significant price increases coming through during the first half of this year, especially in steel that we were able to pass through some of those charges with the coverage on existing customer contracts. But in a couple of instances, we also had pretty favorable hedging positions that were in position through June, through July and sometimes through August. So it's been a mixture of activities, some of it pricing, some of it hedging, some of it resourcing some product.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Paul E. Goldberg,"Okay. So then I want to go back to Bob's point about how kind of rise in pricing pretty much broke even in the quarter. Yet if you look at the Engineered Systems and the Industrial Products businesses, they didn't have as good leverage, and kind of some of the implications is maybe some about was the impact of raws. But you're saying that's not... that's the case. Is that the way to look at it?","John, I might also add that Crenlo is now a part of the Industrial Products. It was added back into that group. Its margins are a little below the group in general. So it would have not been very aided to their ability to leverage in the quarter.",,,,,,,,,
John G. Inch,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. I guess the question is, do you expect leverage to improve in these two businesses kind of going forward or should we just is this an economy issue? Is it just yet to get in to business by business or how should we think about that?","Well I think the business has really performed at 13.5% margins in the quarter. I think there is some potential upside there that they should be able to find over time, whether it be pricing or whether it be internal initiatives and the synergy programs we're working on. In some cases, you have cost of product in order to capture those gains, and there was some plant closings that happened in the group, that we'll see benefit from going forward.",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Hey question on the margins, I mean I am just trying to understand a little bit, kind of the reduction to the margin guidance. We started the year looking kind of 50 to 100 basis points improvement. Now we are looking for 25 to 50. I mean it sounds like, you've been doing a good job on price cost. Sounds like synergies are ahead of plan. So how would you characterize what changed to you are a little less optimistic in terms of the margin improvements this year.","Well I don't think we've really kind of changed our overall position in margin. If we look further up the curve at the end of the second quarter, we thought me might have been at this point which is a nice positive issue to have. I think we are just trying to kind of keep the guidance in line where we think we'll really finish up at. But certainly no lack of confidence in our part on the improvements going on in our companies. Bob, any thing to be added to that?",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Robert A. Livingston,"Hey question on the margins, I mean I am just trying to understand a little bit, kind of the reduction to the margin guidance. We started the year looking kind of 50 to 100 basis points improvement. Now we are looking for 25 to 50. I mean it sounds like, you've been doing a good job on price cost. Sounds like synergies are ahead of plan. So how would you characterize what changed to you are a little less optimistic in terms of the margin improvements this year.","Well I would I guess the other comment would be, I think we are being a bit cautious just given the economic challenges we know we are facing in the second half.",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Robert A. Livingston,"So it's mainly on the economics, I mean you mentioned the hedges, is it... you said it was negligible price cost this quarter. I mean are you assuming it gets worse 3Q, 4Q or any any other dynamics?","To be honest, probably we're more concerned about quarter three than we are quarter four.",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Robert A. Livingston,"Okay. Can you just give a little more of the color, I guess, on what's going on in product ID? I mean the organic growth of the whole segment was sort of flattish. I mean you called out Belvac, it's not that big a business, but it sounds like it's pretty challenged right now. How is how is product ID doing organically?","Organic growth for product ID in the second quarter was 4%. Most of that most of the organic growth, or most of the growth, I'm not sure I can split it regionally on organic growth, but most of the growth that we experienced in the second quarter was led by Europe, Latin America and Asia, and North America was a bit flat but organic growth for the quarter was 4%.",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. And just one more, just on Crenlo, you mentioned, I think getting out of some of the underperforming parts of it before you brought it back in. I mean is Crenlo operating any better now than it was when you put it into dis ops [ph]?","Yes, it is. And Crenlo going to be a low double digit margin business, at least that's about where it's at. I think that we continue to believe those we put it back in our Material Handling group, as there might be some synergies that might share with our Palen [ph] business, and those are going to be explored, and hopefully we can find some additional benefits there.",,,,,,,,,
Shannon O'Callaghan,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. So but it's being brought in, I mean if if you're pursuing those, this is going \to be this is going to be part of the portfolio, not something that, that might go back out the door again?","I think we're going to manage Crenlo as best of our ability to make it the best company possible in Dover. We'll reevaluate our positioning of construction equipment going forward, but I think in today's market, there's just not an appetite for that business currently.",,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Paul E. Goldberg,"Just want to clarify the 12% question, is that 12%... is that up 322 or 326?","No, it's up 322, Nigel.And then you would add in the $0.01 incremental each quarter of this year, report that in total for the discontinuance of Triton and Crenlo.",,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay. And then the $0.03 net impact from synergies into the Q, you had mentioned though I think $0.02 of investments to achieve that. I mean how does that evolve, how is that $0.03 net evolved on over the balance of the year?",I would say that we anticipate continued progress when we talk about the original $40 million to $60 million over two years. That mathematically comes out to somewhere around $0.13 to $0.20. So we picked up a penny in the first quarter and $0.03 in the second. I would say you are likely to see something on the same order magnitude in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Markem-Imaje will continue to be one of the principal drivers of that process. But there is a lot of activity in the same arena going on in other places like the Pump Solutions Group. So I think we feel confident that we are going to be well on track to achieving that kind of progress over two years.,,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Unidentified Company Representative,"Okay. And then the $0.03 net impact from synergies into the Q, you had mentioned though I think $0.02 of investments to achieve that. I mean how does that evolve, how is that $0.03 net evolved on over the balance of the year?",I think we have high confidence. I think we continue to see a little bit more challenging material prices than we anticipated as we made our statement early on. But we are not backing off of it.,,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Robert A. Livingston,"Okay. And then on Triton, I mean it's been struggling for the last couple of years now. I mean why... I mean, I am sure you are now aware of that, but why this quarter? Why do you pull the trigger this quarter?",I think we have a viable buyer currently in place that allow us to move the process forward. And we're taking advantage of that opportunity and this just happens to be the time that it was all in place.,,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Unidentified Company Representative,"Okay, fair enough. I mean just one more question, if I may. I mean natural gas prices have obviously spiked. That's generally good for gas drilling in the U.S., which is obviously good news for you. Are you seeing increasing activity in that field?","Â Representative:
Quite candidly, as we see these spike ups, whether it be natural gas or whether it be oil prices, I think the oil patch is so active and utilization is so tight right now that you don't see significant peaks from that. I think capacity [ph] is very active. It just allows people to have confidence in continuing the projects they have out there, which means that the rigs will be active for a longer period of time. But I don't think we see a huge change in number just based on the price of oil and gas. I think quite candidly, I think as we head into the winner, depending on what happens in the winner timeframe, we might see natural gas continue to hold well, and that will continue to keep drilling activity high. I think Canada will probably improve its drilling in the second half of the year, maybe to what it was in the first half. And we are optimistic about that because we have quite a footprint of businesses in Canada.
",,,,,,,,,
Nigel Coe,Ronald L. Hoffman,"Okay, fair enough. I mean just one more question, if I may. I mean natural gas prices have obviously spiked. That's generally good for gas drilling in the U.S., which is obviously good news for you. Are you seeing increasing activity in that field?","We are somewhat over weighted on the natural gas side. If you look at our Energy group, as a general rule, we benefit more from gas drilling than oil drilling.
",,,,,,,,,
Matt,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Of the 1.5 billion that you spend on metals, could you give us a sense of how much of that is protected through long-term agreements or how much of your spend in the second quarter was at current prices or what had been protected before?","I think the one to clarify for you, Matt that the 1.5 billion was an annual spend.",,,,,,,,,
Matt,Robert G. Kuhbach,"Right, yes. And so of the portion that was in the quarter, how much of that would have been protected through longer term supply agreements?","A number of our companies have long-term hedging agreements to try to minimize their price increases. I will say those have been much more difficult to enforce as we [ph] progress through the course of the year. But again, we're very comfortable in the second quarter that we did recover the majority of the price increases, whether they be through pricing or through internal improvement initiatives. So there was a significant impact in the second quarter. I think that will become a steeper challenge as we move throughout the remainder of the year.",,,,,,,,,
Matt,Paul E. Goldberg,"Right, yes. And so of the portion that was in the quarter, how much of that would have been protected through longer term supply agreements?","And I would just say, Matt, that we don't have that number in exact detail. But I would say more recovery was through price increases than hedging from my knowledge of the business.",,,,,,,,,
