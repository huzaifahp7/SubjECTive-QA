Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,"Thanks for taking the questions. Howard I want to understand a little bit better the discussion on the hard disk drive impact as well as memory impact on the gross margin. Correct me, I think you said two thirds of the gross margin delta in the quarter was attributable to this, is that correct and therefore equating to about 165 basis points or is your guidance assuming with the pricing stabilizing that that comes back into model how are you thinking about gross margin in that context in this current quarter? ** And therefore equating to about 165 basis points or is your guidance assuming with the pricing stabilizing that, that comes back into the model, how are you thinking about gross margin in that context in this current quarter?","Hi, Aaron, yes. I said in the call that basically – you saw the decrease in margin of about 2.5% between quarters from 15.5% to about 13%. I said about 2% of that or over 2% of that was attributable to the hard disk drives and memory but not two-thirds but 2%."
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,2 percentage points?,Yes
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,Okay. And your assumption that therefore you're implying that your gross margin this quarter given that that's stabilized now that you've been able to possibly readjust those pricing with your suppliers that you're assuming that we get back to a 15% level in the current quarter?,"I have not – I've said that our current month it looks stable right now. So it looks stable. However it's really early in the quarter. Aaron, so we tempered our forecast with some of that. Because again if price decreases happen again and again we're still susceptible to that in our inventories. If price is maintained stable, we're going to be okay and then if prices go up, we may see some benefits. So again it's very early in the quarter. We're seeing stability right now but again it's very early in the quarter."
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,"Yeah, I hate to come back to it but stable in your model – would stable mean that, that gross margin impact last quarter comes back to you?","In a way, yes but again we've tempered it in our forecast."
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,"Okay and then the follow-up question, just remind us again your situation as far as the hard disk drive supply agreement, where does that stand? I think last quarter it was $223 million. Where does that stand currently? Maybe you can give us some color on how we should think about that in the context of pricing with those suppliers?","Yeah, right now at the end of the quarter, it stands at about $180 million. And there's a two-year agreement that runs through March of 2014."
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,And that – that has some pricing negotiation to it?,"Yes, it does."
Mark Kelleher,Howard Hideshima,"Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just going to continue right on with that line of thought there. If we take the 2 points and put it back and let's say we didn't have the hard disk drive problem, we'd still be down about 200 basis points from last year. And we had Romleys ramping up. We had a much better utilization of the Taiwan manufacturing facility. I would imagine those two things would be helping. So I'm just trying to figure out where the steady state gross margin number should be? I mean are we now looking at 15%, 16% as the number? And can you still get back to the high-teens where you thought you could get maybe six months ago?","Let me take, Mark. So if we go back to prior to let's say all of those hard disk drive, memory stuff happening, probably about three quarters ago, you will see that we were probably about 16% to 17% as far as the gross margin is concerned. And so in prior quarter – in the June quarter, we said that of that 1.5% decline, majority of that was caused by the hard disk drive and memory and then this quarter I have said that over 2% basically has been caused by the hard disk drive and memory. So you will see a total of around approximately at least 3% caused by hard disk drives and memory over the last couple of quarters, right? As we work our way through the agreements and improve our vendor relationships and work it, we're hopeful that we can get that back so that – again we can get back to that place where we started off about six months ago, nine months ago back to the 16% to 17%. And then you are right. We do have the other things that should be adding to our gross margins which is the Romley launch coming on board and that's increasing our Taiwan facility utilization and then also obviously increasing our product mix with servers and software and support services. So those things are still working and they're going on. I think we just need to work our way through the hard disk drives and memory."
Mark Kelleher,Howard Hideshima,"So there's really 3.5 points that could come back in a stable pricing environment plus the shift back to Romley, the products back to, not necessarily Romley, but the servers, ship back to servers should help that gross margin?","Yeah, certainly that's the impact that we saw coming back from that steady – let's say that state about six months ago."
Mark Kelleher,Howard Hideshima,Is there any thought of having to take a write-down to that inventory?,We've taken our lower costs to our markets to some extent during prior periods. Okay. So we have taken that as the market prices dropped or and the cost is taken. So we have taken some of those write-downs already.
Amelia Harris,Charles Liang,"Hi, this is Amelia in for Alex today. Thanks for taking the question. Basically given the volatility in your business model, wouldn't it make sense at this point to acquire some system level management software or virtualization software that can potentially, I don't know, buffer to your business model and save you from having to aggressively cut OpEx when you experience maybe a less than favorable quarter?","Yes, indeed we are aggressively improving our system management software, including a certain demand management, some virtualization and some storage related tool, so including switch, our high performance switch product line. So we are doing those products now."
Amelia Harris,Charles Liang,And when – I am sorry…,"I'm not acquiring other company, yeah. We still prefer growing organically with our own engineering capability."
Amelia Harris,Charles Liang,Okay. And when do you expect to maybe see an impact from that?,"The impact have been gradually happening since about two quarters ago. So it won't happen kind of overnight by gradual improvement. For example, today we have more than a handful customers now particularly appreciate our software that we have. And this time we have growth consistently."
Michael Bertz,Howard Hideshima,"Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just to kind of go back to the gross margin question again, and Howard, maybe you can walk me through a little bit on this and how much the timing impact do you have particularly from hard drive and memory? And I think mainly from hard drives and in that sense, what is the difference between basically passing through the cost if you're selling in those component or something and just how much you guys are having to eat over these different quarters where pricing is moving around? And I mean I understand it's volatile but 350 bps is a significant amount, and it's like – are you buying it in the previous quarter and having to remarket, and you talked about taking some write-downs just because your marketing it at lower cost for market. I mean how much is that impacting? I am assuming most of it is coming in the sub-system business. Is that right, not in the systems business at all?","Well it actually caused in both sides of it, Mike, to the extent that we incorporate the hard disk drives and the memory into our server systems. So any type of price changes and their impact the overall server margin also. So it is not just isolated in the components to sub-system business."
Michael Bertz,Howard Hideshima,"So this is – just go back to the timing question then, so what's the cycle time basically? I know I am obviously – can tell what your days inventory is, but what's the cycle times, when you actually buy it to when you actually turn it and put it in a system and sell it, I mean how quickly can that happen internally versus how quickly the price changes externally?","Well the price changes have been happening fairly quickly recently. I mean I think in this previous pricing quarter we actually saw against the strength and then at the end of the quarter we saw a pretty steep drop in the pricing happen per se. I think as some customers were basically trying to get rid of some of their inventory, we saw some pricing pressure at the end of the quarter. So again, it, the timing wise can happen fairly quickly, obviously quicker than when we can turn the inventory."
Michael Bertz,Charles Liang,"So well then again – not to beat a dead horse so hard, but how quickly can you turn the inventory through your systems, what – again from the time you buy it to the time you ship it and book the revenue? How long is that typically?","I guess about one month basically. One month but this time is worse because during the hard drive disk shortage, we tried to grow our inventory level. So we grew to about almost six weeks to seven weeks. And that's about the worst case."
Michael Bertz,Howard Hideshima,"Okay. So then let's look back to the other part of maybe what's impacting margin and that's mix. So would you characterize the balance of the impact then, Howard, in the last quarter mostly going from mix which kind of tilted unfavourably toward you guys?","Well there is a small portion of this but I do want to make sure that like I said, I have said over 2% of the 2.5% margin impact was due to hard disk drives and memory. Certainly there is some related to mix. I mean we did ship less server systems than we did in the prior quarter."
Michael Bertz,Charles Liang,"Okay. And then just now go back up to where you've seen the demand come from, I mean and I'm sure some of this is tied, I know you talked a little about the data center being little bit lumpier people waiting and so I get that 40% is a big change quarter to quarter though. As you also look geographically, I mean, U.S. is down 15% and Europe was up a little bit which seems a little bit counterintuitive in a way, Asia I believe being up 34% quarter to quarter, that makes sense. But anything you can attribute to the different shifts you have there both geographically and sort of where end markets of those are coming from?","Yeah, USA is more competitive in the last two quarters. Especially when we have a hard drive high price appraisal. And another fact I believe because our FatTwin– our FatTwin is really remarkable architecture, and we also experienced some customers they're waiting for that. The good thing is that product line is in production now finally. So that we have our performance in this quarter, December quarter."
Michael Bertz,Charles Liang,Okay so Charles just to make sure I'm understanding this right what you're implying is that because you have higher priced systems particularly here in states because of your hard drive problems you were less competitive against maybe Dell or HP is that accurate?,"Basically, yeah."
Michael Bertz,Charles Liang,"Okay and so you think with the new products here into December we should be in better shape so how would you think then I guess geographically relatively would you assert that the U.S. would be now relatively stronger quarter-to-quarter versus say Europe, you're looking into December, would that be your expectation?","Because the USA market is more sensitive in technology. Whenever we introduce new architecture USA markets basically responds quicker, that's another factor."
Michael Bertz,Howard Hideshima,"Okay, understood. And last question, Howard, you mentioned of almost $600,000 write-off in marketing materials and that was in this quarter?",That's correct.
Michael Bertz,Howard Hideshima,"And that seems like a lot, what was that about?","It was more of, just some of our demo and demo type of equipment that we have out there in the field as we're [familiaring] new products and what have you."
Brian Freed,Charles Liang,"Good afternoon. Just drilling down a little bit more on Hard disc drives. Can you talk a little bit about what specific steps you are able take to alleviate the impact of future erratic prices, both on hard drives and memory? Are there any ways to one access the long-term pricing contracts, or to increase the frequency of the re-pricing? And then secondly, could you give us any additional color around the current utilization rate of your new manufacturing facility and how that transition is going?","Okay I mean for the hard drive inventory question again. Usually we keep us three to four weeks inventory for hard drive and memory but again during the hard drive big shortage timeframe for safety, we'd raise the inventory level to seven weeks so that kind of a clear – a big trouble when price had a big drop and again basically we keep about three-four week's inventory. As through the facility utilization, I mean Asia facility for sure is a big incremental to us and last quarter we have a 65% growth compared with one year ago, so that dramatically improved our utilization. And today I would like to say we have maybe 30% capacity use, so there has to be a 70% room to grow and we feel very positive for that capacity available."
Brian Freed,Charles Liang,"And can you talk about what your targets are in terms of increasing, that utilization of your capacity there?","Okay I mean again last year we grow about 65% in Asia and next year, I hope we can grow more than 65%. So even we've grown 65% utilization we have reached almost 65% to 70%, so that will be in much better position."
Brian Freed,Charles Liang,Okay and how material do you think that doubling of your utilization could be on your gross margin profile?,"It all depends, if we grow in Asia as Asia margin had to be lower, but if we use those capacity for support customer in Europe then the margin will be slightly better."
Brian Freed,Charles Liang,"Okay and then my last follow-up on the hard disc drive inventory, understanding it had gotten up to seven weeks. Are you down three to four weeks at this point of time where you're still somewhere between three and seven weeks?",I guess about four weeks at this moment.
Glenn Hanus,Charles Liang,"Hi. On Asia, could you just talk a little bit more about the strength over there. Did you have some customer specific rollouts, that – wins that you had or the general strength in the region? Thanks.","Yeah, I mean since 18 months ago we start to aggressively grow our sales and marketing teams, (Inaudible) teams, so and that's why we grow 65% last year right. So this trend we are continue for sure, and because we already in enabled lots (Inaudible) now those accounts start to buy product."
Glenn Hanus,Howard Hideshima,Can you comment on your operating expense plans now going forward?,"Yeah, Glenn. We're going to obviously continue invest but we're watching it very closely as far as the operating expense I think you don't know that our operating expense were basically flat quarter to quarter, right. And so we'll continue to invest in our R&D but we'll be very prudent with our return on investment going forward."
Aaron Rakers,Howard Hideshima,"Yeah, thanks. A real quick one. The Internet Data Center vertical, just looking at the numbers you were down about 43% sequentially by my math. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that vertical and I think you alluded to deals pushing out, was that specific to that vertical, and if such, was there any large deals that possibly pushed out in the quarter?","And Aaron, before ourselves, yeah, we did push out I mean there were some customers that, as you know, data centers are looking at the latest technologies, so they were evaluating the Sandy Bridge, and so they didn't quite finish their evaluation at the end but we still believe that they're going to be coming in so. Again it's the transition to the new technology, we're seeing that they like our new product, especially the Sandy Bridge, and they just need to get to the testing process."
Robert Maina,Charles Liang,"Yeah, thank you, for taking my question. I just want to get a quick update – answer, that you said earlier in your presentation, Charles, you said that you were working to improve your inventory and manage the components supply chain better. Can you exactly tell us what processes you're putting in place to make sure that in the future, you do a better job at managing this? Thank you?","Okay. Basically, in (Inaudible) is kind of almost never happened before a bigger price up and down in our five months time frame so from there we already enhanced our relationship with our hard drive and as well as memory company the relationship, so now we have a much better high level relationship and have some contracts signed. And we today, we've also dedicated a position inside the company now to watch those market change and those vendors policy (Inaudible)."
Robert Maina,Charles Liang,"Price declines and [ECD] components like you sold this past quarter, does that mean gross margins go lower than the 13% or can you buff it that somehow with some of the new processes you've put in place? Thank you.","Of course, I'm very happy to say that our hard drive and memory inventory already lowered to much more healthy level, we do have $13 million, Over $10 million, just in hard drive and memory inventory. So that's for sure dramatically improve our position. And like Howard just said, we now have dedicated position to watch those change periodically. So that to prevent from to minimize that risk."
Robert Maina,Charles Liang,Okay but if I look at the inventory levels still at fairly significant level relative to previous periods how much maybe of the inventory is related to components hard drives and memory. Thank you.,Like Howard just mentioned hard drive we already reduced $110 million. And overall inventory still high because we expect kind of good revenue this quarter (Inaudible) especially with FatTwin and our special workstation HFT optimizers solution we too need more inventory to prepare for the strong demand this quarter.
