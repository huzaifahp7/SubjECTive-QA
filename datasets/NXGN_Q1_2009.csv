Sean Wieland,Rusty Frantz,"So, first starting on the attrition, I guess what you are doing to be proactive in stem the tide here and convince these clients to stay with you.","So, let me separate first of all the two buckets of attrition, one being buckets of attrition driven from health system affiliate and owned versus kind of normal run rate attrition in our core ambulatory base. We're comfortable though not satisfied with attrition in the core ambulatory base, but what we are doing now is we have segmented our client base from the bottoms up and looked at every single client where they sit within their local ecosystem and what the pressures of that client are and from that really come up with a forecasted at-risk list. And sort of be proactive, we're actually getting in and optimizing those clients long before they ever even think about whether or not there is a different opportunity available for them within their local ecosystem. And then on top of that, we continue to beef up and expand our account management footprint and making sure that we really tightly connected with the client base."
Sean Wieland,Rusty Frantz,"So given this forecast that you have, do you have any insight you can share as to when this trend turns around and you’ll get this back under control?","We expect to see the trend stabilize as we move through this year and moderate into next year. We've built that into our model as I've said and frankly that challenged our model a little bit on this year, but as we look at next year, frankly, the bookings energy that is coming through plus you know if we look at there are some finite pools of attrition that I mean frankly the Cerner conversion of the Siemens space moved much more quickly and suddenly than we expected but that has a finite -- that has a finite limit to it which is not too far down the road, so that's one bucket of attrition that we feel will start to roll off. As we look forward, naturally we don't have a crystal ball, we can only make the best efforts to understand which client could be at risk and forecast based on that. But it's a challenging thing to forecast, but we continue to get a little better at it as we really look bottoms up."
Matthew Gillmor,Rusty Frantz,"Thanks for the question. I may have missed it, did you give the attrition number and then I'd be curious if you could give us a sense for what portion of your attrition you think as sort of controllable or can be mitigated versus what's just sort of normal in terms of health systems making decisions or PE firms buying clients.","First of all, the number was 13.9% and I guess I should say thank you for the questions since I'm not asking you what. But I think when we look at it, we haven't broken out attrition more granularly up to this point in time. What I would say is, I go back to the previous comment which is when you look at kind of normal attrition in our core ambulatory base that's actually well within what we expect, it's really a little bit of a spike in the other part of the base, the health system owned and affiliated that's driving the overage."
Matthew Gillmor,Rusty Frantz,And then as you -- I appreciate the comments on the three-year outlook and getting to the high-single digit growth rate next year. You did make a comment about if attrition continues and you’d be more like mid-single digit. I think previously you talked about kind of 8% attrition or somewhere in that zone as being sort of baked into the three-year target.,"Actually no that's not correct, we actually talked about a higher number than that, we talked about 11% being baked into this year. We're naturally above that right now and that's putting a little bit of pressure. I think if we look at longer term, as our understanding has continued to evolve, I think we're comfortable kind of in the 8% to 10% range from an attrition standpoint and if you look at the longer-term model, as we bring that down towards the 10% number, the model continues to be intact."
Jeff Garro,Rusty Frantz,I want to follow-up on bookings here. You are well ahead of 20% year over year bookings growth for the first six months of the fiscal year and you are kind of set that as a expectation for the full year previously. So maybe you could help us think about a revised expectation or how we should think about the back half whether year over year growth is achievable in each quarter and where that might land you guys at the end of the fiscal year. Thanks.,"Well, naturally if you looked at FY ’19, we made the first half of this year a little easier by not doing that well in the first half of last year, right. So we've driven some great bookings growth, but we did it off of some lower comps. And so as we move into the back half when we started seeing strength in the back half in FY ’18; FY ’19, our expectation is that we should continue to see year over year bookings growth in each quarter, but I would not expect the level of beat that we've seen in this quarter."
Jeff Garro,Rusty Frantz,Understood. And then one more from me on the revised revenue outlook for the fiscal year. I was hoping if you could provide more of a breakdown on the impact from scheduled implementation versus client implementation and kind of type or magnitude of bookings that’s come in and maybe shifted as you’ve tracked deals throughout a quarter from that more licensed deal to more subscription and all-in nature as that’s evolved into -- to your revenue outlook. Thanks.,"Yeah, I mean I'm not really in a position to comment on the breakdown of the two -- the contribution of the two, but what I would say is, if we if you think about for example the deal we signed -- we signed -- the significant deal we signed in Q2. It has as we look at the implementation plan, it's quite complex because we're not just implementing software, we're actually outsourcing their entire financial back end. And so when you get into these larger complex implementations and frankly, we're learning a little bit as we go along and start to see these larger and larger deals. We're really starting to have a better understanding of how to forecast them. But the reality is that we did expect probably some more of the single solution deals than we ended up with and that's put a little bit of pressure on revenue conversion. It's kind of why when you think about what I talked about on the call; Q2, clearly we're down a little bit; Q3, we expect kind of the same dynamic; but in Q4, back half of Q4, you start to see the cut in some of these large deals and that starts to bring the revenue number back and then as we get into next year, this continues to flow in. And so, I would say that certainly attrition put some pressure on the revenue, but we really expected the revenue mix to show up differently and that just put pressure on timelines which creates this gap. The good news is that you know this gap then flows into the ratable revenue that flows from these large recurring deals."
Jeff Garro,Jamie Arnold,Understood. And then one more from me on the revised revenue outlook for the fiscal year. I was hoping if you could provide more of a breakdown on the impact from scheduled implementation versus client implementation and kind of type or magnitude of bookings that’s come in and maybe shifted as you’ve tracked deals throughout a quarter from that more licensed deal to more subscription and all-in nature as that’s evolved into -- to your revenue outlook. Thanks.,"Rusty, if I could just a little color because I mentioned it in my comments about the managed services revenue being down. We had a client that was acquired by a private equity firm that without notice and a client that was quite happy with the service they were getting from us terminated their relationship and a multi-million dollar hit to the revenue this year. So that also added into the other factors that we've talked about."
Steven Halper,Rusty Frantz,"On the opening comments, you indicated that earnings benefited from some one-time accruals in the quarter, could you just expand on that?","Yes, my least favorite one-time accrual, Steve. It is the one-time accrual of lowering management incentive plan because our expectations on revenue are not what they were at the beginning of the year. Yes, there's a pretty steep pay-for-performance curve which is absolutely appropriate. And as we look at that, we have to look at the range of results and that's why I said our EPS was in line with our expectations, but then there was an extra benefit laid on top of it."
Sean Dodge,Rusty Frantz,"Jamie maybe going back to the booking for a moment, great result there, can you share with us how much of that was driven by replacement activity or came from outside your core NextGen footprint and then I guess if you don’t want to give that level of granularity, can you at least help through the proportion from replacement was higher or lower this quarter then it was last?","I believe it is slightly up from previous quarters, we are seeing a little bit of uptick in that area from the prior quarters."
Sean Dodge,Rusty Frantz,"On the revenue delays, Rusty, I think you touched on it a bit, but these larger more complex deals, on average, how much longer are those implementations take? Is this the expectation that we see revenue kind of tick up in the fourth quarter is that because other things are coming out of backlog or is that because these things on average take two quarters longer to put in place?","Yeah, I mean what we're generally seeing especially these large all-in RCM deals is, it's more in the six- to nine-month range from a cut in standpoint. Whereas, for example, the implementation of next NextGen Enterprise perhaps that's more like a three- to four-month. Eagle Dream, our population health analytics and mobile are also much shorter timelines. And so, as we get -- and also especially given that these were not just all-in deals not just the implementation of RCM, so when we see like a single RCM deal for an existing client that's more kind of in the four- to six-month timeframe than the six- to nine-month time frame."
David Larsen,Rusty Frantz,"Can you talk a little bit about your revenue expectations for fiscal ’20, I mean with such like healthy and robust bookings growth for the first half of the year, how long does it take to convert that bookings and backlog into revenue? Is it six to nine months or is it three to five years?","So, what we said when we talk about next year is that -- especially given the great performance on the booking side that we are committed as we sit here today to our high single-digit revenue guidance that we've provided now for the last year and half. As we look at next year and frankly, as we look at probably not doing the best job of forecasting attrition over the last couple of quarters that's pushed us to maybe be a little more conservative in next year's guidance that we might have other and if you heard in my opening remarks I did leave room that if we're incorrect in our attrition forecast that could put pressure on next year's revenue number down to the mid-single digits. But just to be clear, attrition is a continuing fact frankly in everybody's business. There is client churn, there is pressure on the health systems side, all of that is really built into our model. Going from where we are this year, which is really pretty much flat on the revenue line now. When you look at the bookings growth that we have, it's pretty easy to see how that's going to turn in and more than offset the attrition and like I said, as long as attrition sixes in, what we expect to get it to, we expect to deliver high single digit growth next year, but we are leaving room frankly just because we haven't been as effective for a little bit of pressure on that."
David Larsen,Rusty Frantz,"Okay. And then can you quantify how much of a benefit there was in the legal settlement in your SG&A? And for the bonus accrual, was that also in SG&A, like, how much, there was a very significant sequential drop, I think, it was like 10 million bucks. How much of that is one time and like what’s a steady like state going forward?","So the legal settlement was a credit of about just under $6 million in the SG&A. And the other thing, year-over-year, under 606 accounting, you get a -- you amortize the cost of acquiring new customers. So that resulted in about – a little over $1 million decrease year-over-year, where if we were on a 505, it actually would have been an increase, sorry, 605, it would have been an increase in expenses. And then as well, we have lower consulting costs related to the conversion of 606."
David Larsen,Rusty Frantz,"Okay. All right. And then was the bonus piece -- was that in gross profit or SG&A and can you size that and if not, no problem at all?","It’s right across all line items. And in terms of sizing it, off the top of my head, I rather not say, but it’s enough to make a difference that we call it down."
Ricky Goldwasser,Rusty Frantz,"Just going back to the fiscal year 20, high single digit goals. Obviously, as you are more successful in closing the all-in deals, we’re going to see these conversion ratios potentially continue to expand. So when you think about next year, how do you think about that kind of like target mix. Do you build in an acceleration in the all-in deals or are you assuming the same ratios as you’ve experienced year-to-date?","I think at this point in time, we’re assuming maybe a little bit of growth in the all-in deals, as we continue to get more effective there and so that would indicate that bookings are going to stretch a little longer. That being said, as we continue to -- as I said earlier in my remarks, we've made some significant investments in leadership on the service and support side, which includes implementation and so we're also starting to -- we're increasingly maturing as a group able to implement more effectively and so I kind of expect those two things to somewhat offset each other and the bookings to revenue conversion as a whole probably to stay not too different than it is today."
Ricky Goldwasser,Jamie Arnold,Okay. And then can you just comment on the margin progression for this year and then how should we think about margins for next year?,"So we would expect next year that the operating margin will show leverage. As the revenue starts to accelerate into the high single digits, you will start to see the leverage start to show up on the income statement. But we're talking 100 or 200 basis points, but what we've laid out is that we would expect to start to show leverage next year, leading us to getting to at or about 20% by fiscal 2022."
Jamie Stockton,Jamie Arnold,"Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe the first one, just the attrition, is it hitting the subscription line as well. And the reason I ask that is that number has kind of been hanging out around 27 million or something in that neighborhood for a number of quarters. So I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about the puts and takes there and the direction of it going forward.","There is attrition in the subscription line and the number we give, to be clear, the number we give is related -- is factored for NextGen enterprise maintenance. But there is attrition in this subscription line, particularly as you think about the NG office, which is a small practice subscription offering that we have. So there is subscription. I will culminate with period notes, but we had a large credit, a larger than usual credit, it went out this quarter. We had a very short term blip in our subscription offering and so we gave customers a credit in the quarter, I didn't call it out as a factor, but that’s attributed to the lower growth, we referenced a 2% growth in subscription for the quarter year-over-year, but that was somewhat muted because of this credit that we gave."
Jamie Stockton,Jamie Arnold,"And then, the bonus accrual maybe, part of what's going on in the R&D line, but it was down a decent amount sequentially. I know, it sounds like your capitalized R&D was up maybe $1 million or somewhere in that ballpark, but is there just a lower level of kind of absolute development work that you guys are having to do right now? Or is there maybe a transition of headcount to lower cost areas, is there any color on what's going on there?","Two things. Quarter-over-quarter, gross R&D expense is down a little bit and it's down for -- because of the bonuses part of it, we’ve reduced the number of outside consultants that we’re using, doing more of it internally and then the capitalized software was up almost $1 million quarter-over-quarter. So if you put those factors together, that's why you're getting a decrease in the net R&D costs this quarter."
Jamie Stockton,Rusty Frantz,"And then, the bonus accrual maybe, part of what's going on in the R&D line, but it was down a decent amount sequentially. I know, it sounds like your capitalized R&D was up maybe $1 million or somewhere in that ballpark, but is there just a lower level of kind of absolute development work that you guys are having to do right now? Or is there maybe a transition of headcount to lower cost areas, is there any color on what's going on there?",I would not expect us to reduce gross R&D expense throughout this year. [Technical Difficulty] ebb and flow of employee attrition.
George Hill,Jamie Arnold,"I guess first here, Jamie, can you talk about bookings concentration in the quarter. The number in and of itself was pretty impressive, but I guess can you talk about the number of deals that kind of continued to the strong bookings and then I have a quick follow up?","We don't really break them down that way, but what I'd say is the bookings concentration was pretty -- was relatively consistent from what we saw in Q1 as well. I mean, we did have one large deal, but all in all, I would say everything just shows up a little bit larger and we're seeing really good deal flow. I mean, I would say that right now, we feel like it's primarily driven by just consistent execution of a playbook."
George Hill,Rusty Frantz,"And then I guess if -- just as a remainder, I imagine when we talk about churn, we're talking about it on a dollar basis and not as a seed basis. And I guess I would then – I’d ask kind of the inverse question of what is the churn rate or I guess what would be the elevated churn rate where we would start to be concerned about an inability to deliver 5% or 6% revenue growth next year.","What I would say is, I’d say that if we're at current levels, my expectation is throughout next year that that will probably push us into the mid singles. Jamie, would you agree that?"
Stephanie Demko,Rusty Frantz,"So just on the implementation side, as your bookings [indiscernible] you’ve made for your implementation teams to prepare them for these largest scale deals?","Absolutely. So the first thing we did was about six months ago, we moved out a legacy leader and brought in a gentleman who came out of Allscripts who's got some great background and capabilities, both in the space and it also worked with a number of our leadership team. On top of that though, now, over the last six months, he's also replaced and brought in a leader from the implementation side that really brings in a lot of the external capabilities versus the ones just invented here and is really starting to challenge our teams to look at things differently and we're starting to really also aggressively invest in making sure that our folks are trained, not just in our capabilities, but in understanding the client's environment. And then finally, really establishing connectivity between sales implementation and support classically. They've operated a little more separately and you can see the challenges that bring. Sales, that's one expectation with the client, implementation team comes in may or may not be aware of that expectation and so by really starting to regionalize our structure and bring people together much more tightly, we're establishing a much more continuous handoff, but also kind of joint accountability across our organizational math for delivering the right implementation result in the right timeframe. And so between that and also continuing to look to how do we expand that team ahead of demand, so that we make sure they're educated and on-boarded when it is show time."
Stephanie Demko,Jamie Arnold,"And then have you, I guess on the flip side of attrition, have you see any benefits from the strategic alternative passes that is going on at one of your peers to kind of help the bookings process?","It's interesting. I’d say it's -- so I don't think that many of our clients really spend a lot of time reading about the investor side of their providers. I think we've seen benefit less from the strategic process and just more from the fact that we work -- we wake up every day focused on this market and some of our competitors have multiple markets they're focused on and that distraction has been a benefit for us and really enabled us to frankly with some of our competitors move from losing to neutral and with some to taking share. And so it's been great to watch that transition and yeah, I mean, that's kind of the way I see it. It is interesting, though, I mean, those of us who talk at the investor level really know all these things, but the average ambulatory physician practice neither knows nor cares. They just want a good solution that drives their results and gets them to the place they need to and they want to know that their vendor wakes up every day and thinks about their success, not both their success and the success of the hospital down the street."
Stephanie Demko,Rusty Frantz,"And one last quick one from me on the Telehealth side, what drove your decision to partner with auto?","We did a strong RFP process and we looked at somebody who had a capability that really fit well into our solution and as we've exposed our API layer, had the capabilities to truly integrate with them and it's interesting, Telehealth and Tele-medicine is a very broad category from everything, from telemetry and monitoring to, I don't even have a physician and I just want to get a physician for this one, for Jamie's cough that you guys all hear in the background. And what we have though, on the other hand, we already have providers. For us, it’s giving them the capability to be able to interact with their patients in a situation where the patients don't have to show up at the office, right, and so that virtual visit capability enables our client base to deliver the patient engagement capability that frankly is very captivating. And so it puts them and enables them to compete with some of the pure play telemedicine players that are out there and frankly given the fact that they already have the patients, that they have specialty capabilities and everything like that, we think it actually gives them a nice leg up. We’re excited to share at UGM."
Mike Ott,Rusty Frantz,"If I could, just a follow-up on the Telehealth contract Stephanie just asked about, can you disclose any more about the structure of the users there, maybe even the pricing?","I'm going to save that one for our user group meeting, but let's just say that the pricing that we're putting forward we feel is very competitive. It enables our clients to be competitive against the Telehealth offerings that they compete with in the field."
Mike Ott,Rusty Frantz,"And then at the Analyst Day last month, I believe you said CMS ACO risk proposal from August was increasing demand a bit for Eagledream or risk contracts. I just wondered if you have yet maybe try and creep the share there in terms of prospects or anything that they’ve got signed so far.","I mean we're seeing a lot of success with the population of the analytics capabilities. What I'd say is, we continue to see nice momentum from the sales side. We're starting now to deliver the NextGen population health clients that are live that can start to be references to the rest of the client base. Any time you bring in a new capability like that, you start with your early adopter pool who are always going to jump on board and frankly then having a great medical officer who truly understands the market and can captivate them as often. As we start to move forward now, we start to move to the clients that want to hear some success stories, not from us, but from other clients. And so that's really the focus now and I think that we're seeing good deal flow now, but as we start to see those referenced stories really emerge, especially with the integrated capability we're launching in the fall with building that directly into the ambulatory platform, that's when I think we’ll start to see more uptake."
Sandy Draper,Rusty Frantz,"Thanks very much. And I think Jamie, I think I can match your cough. So hopefully you can hear me okay. I guess, my question is, it’s essentially similar to the comment Rusty made early on about getting people on the latest version. One of your competitors mentioned that they’re a big user of your conference. How much control do you have on that, because I totally agree and I think it makes sense, but what can you do and how much control do you have to be able to get them to upgrade because there -- you can show them functionality, but if they're like, yeah, but the downtime of the commitment, how do you get them over the hump. If they haven't moved now, what's going to make them move tomorrow?","So it's interesting. So I mean if I look at it, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% of our core direct clients have upgraded and there's another 50% that tend to skew smaller that haven’t. And so we're putting together both programs to help them get upgraded and frankly we're also dedicating some dollars to it. And then on top of that though, over time, we're going to start, for the first time in this organization, we're going to start talking with our clients about end of life and end of support and so we're not there yet, but at some point in time, our clients really need to move forward, frankly not for us, but for them. And so it’s, number one, it is really targeting clients having the conversation, holding our reseller channels accountable to be doing the same things, investing in resources to help get them over the line and frankly pulling people into hosting arrangements, so we can upgrade them as they come into that arrangement. There's no silver bullet here. It's a little bit of just -- it is attacking the issue from all sides. But as we move into next year October, we believe that will drive upgrading within a broader client base, as you see the next regulatory boundary come along. And then on top of that, as we look at national interoperability, if you're on old versions, you don't have access to that. So there's a lot of good and over time, there will be a little bit more pressure from us, but in the near term, we're trying to lead them there and even sometimes spend a little bit of money to get them there."
Sandy Draper,Rusty Frantz,"And then jumping back on to the revenue push out of the bookings, just trying to make sure I understand how much of this do you think was your forecast or your -- you saw the bookings, you forecast in a certain way and then it didn't work as you forecasted or that you had to plan out and then once you got operational, things got slower. I’m just trying to understand, was it operational delays, it could be a little bit of both?","It’s probably a little bit of both. I mean, certainly, we did not anticipate the all-in deals being as effective as they are nor did we anticipate frankly some of them coming in from outside of our client base, right, which was a longer cut in time. And so, certainly that was part of it, but then certainly -- but then also, look, I mean as everybody knows, we’ve come through a tremendous amount of change and evolution over the last three years. We keep on running into the next challenge as we start to really move towards growth and this -- so the first challenge was keep, make your client successful and have software that actually delivers for them. The second challenge was okay, now, let's build capabilities and bring in capabilities to help really drive the clients to the next level or take them to the next level. The next challenge was, get a commercial organization that can deliver bookings growth. Now, we've moved into implementation as the next challenge and then frankly past that, we would get into service and support, which we're working on directly right now, but I expect it to move all the way back to the front end of strategy and R&D as soon as we really get this current model operationalized, because once we're effective with what we're doing today, you can expect us to then choose to do more."
Anne Samuel,Jamie Arnold,"As we think about the delay in revenue recognition from some of those subscriptions that you called out, how do we think about how that impacts the gross margin line. Do you see near term benefit from mix in the near term and then just on the expense line, is R&D incremental investment in SG&A necessary to turn around that attrition number?","Let's start with the second question. We have started a discussion internally over whether we should, whether some incremental resources would be helpful because Rusty touched on what is making us successful in addressing this earlier, which is closer contact with the large clients and in getting into their C-suite. And to do that on a regular basis, it may require us to add the small number of incremental resources, so we are actively exploring it as we see. So, there might be a small increment that we bring on that had not been anticipated, but it is -- we have included some portion of that into our guidance as we go forward."
Anne Samuel,Rusty Frantz,"As we think about the delay in revenue recognition from some of those subscriptions that you called out, how do we think about how that impacts the gross margin line. Do you see near term benefit from mix in the near term and then just on the expense line, is R&D incremental investment in SG&A necessary to turn around that attrition number?","Yeah. On the first question, I'll take a stab at it. What I'd say is from a gross margin dollar standpoint, the all-in deals and the delay have put pressure on the gross margin absolute dollar line, which to some degree has been offset with the one-time positive accruals and that's really how you get from the previous midpoint of our EPS range to the current one. So you've got some downward pressure from revenue delay and the gross margin that didn't come with that and you've got some upward pressure from one time accruals."
Anne Samuel,Jamie Arnold,"As we think about the delay in revenue recognition from some of those subscriptions that you called out, how do we think about how that impacts the gross margin line. Do you see near term benefit from mix in the near term and then just on the expense line, is R&D incremental investment in SG&A necessary to turn around that attrition number?","And I would further add Anne that the accounting for revenue and expenses under both 605 and 606, as is often, as you get a different answer under those and this is an area where under 605, five we would not be taking revenue on these contracts or under 606, you would be taking particularly the services and implementation revenue. So I have not thought about a specific question you have and that’s why Rusty and I sort of look to each other and said, no, you take, no, it’s yours. So, good question and we don't have a real clear answer on it."
David Hooker,Rusty Frantz,"So with respect to the attrition thinking going forward, where is your sort of client mix with respect to sort of standalone physician practices and with respect to health system affiliated practices. I mean, there I guess, you never want to lose a client, but I guess the good news, you can't lose them twice. So I mean, going forward, is there kind of some reassurance to hey, maybe had some bad luck with a couple of big ones, but hey, going forward, we're more -- less aligned with those types of practices, can you comment on that a little bit?","Yeah. I mean, we haven't broken out attrition, we haven't broken out the client base by whose hospital affiliated not and don’t want to go that deep in to the client base, but what I will say is that from the big player in the industry, we expect pressure to continue from the second biggest player, we expect that to moderate."
David Hooker,Rusty Frantz,"And then I guess you guys have focused a lot on hosting and I think you might have alluded to this in one of your answers to one of the questions. I assume as you get more hosting that you’re not experiencing much attrition within those clients, right, if you get that hosting arrangement, I would assume you're more locked in, is that a fair assumption?","You're more locked in, but you know what, we're taking share from some of the cloud based competitors, right? So, the fact that you're hosting some of these single tenant or multi-tenant is by no means a silver bullet. And so it helps. I’d say it helps more because we probably do a better job of both upgrading and monitoring and managing their solution and perhaps they do especially at some of our smaller scale clients and so that does have a positive impact on stickiness, but I just don't want to get too comfortable in it, because as I said, I mean, hey, we’re taking share from Athena, right, and they're taking some from us, but clearly it's not stopping people from leaving a fully hosted co-source arrangement with Athena."
