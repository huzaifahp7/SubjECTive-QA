Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"Hi, this is Brian Peterson stepping in for Brian Alexander. To start off, a clarification on the MME gross margins. Did you say that there were some larger deals that pressured that in the quarter? And just looking at it going forward, it looks like your services comps are actually a little bit easier starting in the fourth quarter. So as we look out into the fourth quarter and heading into 2011, should we expect this to be the trough, all else equal?","With respect to larger deals, we obviously will take whatever deals come our way, and the pricing is what the market dictates, and so they were, and will continue to be, accretive to our bottom line. With respect to our services business, as we stated we do have a strong pipeline and we are optimistic and are very focused on the growth prospects for that business going forward. So the one thing that I do caution you on though, and I wouldn't call it caution, because it's actually a positive thing, is that we are not focused on a particular mix, so we'll take whatever business we can get in each of the areas that we're focused on. We're focused on both products and services. But the trough that you're talking about with respect to absolute dollar sales, absolutely. We want to drive growth in services going forward, and think we can do that. With respect to percentage of business and its effect on overall gross margins, it's going to be a function of what we get in product sales and what we get in services sales. We're not going to stop once we get to a particular product sales number."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"And to follow up on the services growth, can you talk a little bit about the NSPI acquisition going forward, and maybe how you’ve been able to leverage their customer base into what you're already selling, your cross-selling opportunities, or vice versa? Just a little bit of detail on that?","So, on the NSPI front, it's very early going. That has just happened, and the integration is underway. Our initial and early indications are nothing but goodness there. There's a lot of customer excitement. There's a lot of vendor excitement, and there's a very solid pipeline of business building, of selling those services, or potentially selling those services, into our existing accounts or into our legacy existing accounts. Kris, do you want to add anything to that?"
Brian Peterson,Kristin Rogers,"And to follow up on the services growth, can you talk a little bit about the NSPI acquisition going forward, and maybe how you’ve been able to leverage their customer base into what you're already selling, your cross-selling opportunities, or vice versa? Just a little bit of detail on that?","I think a couple of things. First, I think the offering for NSPI is very accretive to us from an SMB perspective. The hosting and remote monitoring services businesses provide a really kind of in the space that a lot of SMB accounts are looking for some support right now. And I think second to that, Brian, is as we talk with folks like Cisco, and Microsoft, and HP, and they're trying to figure out exactly what the go to market strategy is going to be for different cloud and SAS offerings, I think NSPI has given us a really good foundation to start to build on. And so as Frank indicated, I think there looks like a lot of opportunity on a go forward basis across our legacy customer base and potentially to position us for reaching out to new customers as new opportunities come up."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"The SMB segment. The productivity metrics have actually been pretty impressive. If I'm looking at GP dollars for headcount, it looks like it's been up in the high teens each quarter this year, and I know you guys have been hiring some people in your Chicago office. Are they still underperforming, your sort of legacy SMB sales force to the extent that we could probably see a lot more there, and we're sort of in the early innings? Or is it more that they have actually caught up and the improvement should be muted relative to the comps that we've seen?","Well, as you know that office is pretty young, so on a ten-year base productivity basis we're very pleased with what they've been able to generate and deliver so far. But with respect to the terminal point that you made, they are nowhere near that. As to your analogy, we're very much early innings."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"Based on the fourth quarter guidance, I know you reiterated your margin guidance. Can you just talk about what you're expecting in terms of revenue as far as normal seasonality or budget flush or any qualitative read on demand?","So as you know we don't forecast the future, but from a demand perspective demand continues to be very strong, and we're very pleased with demand and pretty much the same segments that we've had the strong demand in the third quarter. And on the consumer front, we are actually getting some additional traction with respect to some of our efforts, so whereas we don't know what we don't know, and it remains to be seen what the impact of our strategy changes will be the first quarter, the first Christmas quarter, or holiday quarter, that our strategy change comes into play, and we have more of business to business focus there, but we are expecting a significant increase in consumer sales, and possibly a return to year-over-year growth starting in the fourth quarter. But if not starting in the fourth quarter, then we are very optimistic about that in next year. So all good news there from a demand perspective."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"Just lastly, I know you mentioned that Apple sales were pretty strong this quarter, and specifically the iPad. Can you talk about that success as far as SMB, MME, consumer?","We are very pleased with the adoption of the iPad across, and in, segments that we believe are relatively new frontiers or virgin frontiers for Apple. It's been quicker than we thought, and deeper than we thought. And it's allowed us to leverage our position in the marketplace, one of the leaders, one of the largest with respect to sales, we believe that that will continue. We think that it's only the beginning, and one of the things that could happen as well is like the iPod where there was a halo effect, and allowed iPod sales into consumer to allow for adoption of Macintosh computers into the consumer market, hopefully the iPad adoption to businesses will at some point start expanding the computer sales, or the Mac sales I should say, into corporations as well. We've started seeing some of that, but it's early innings and the opportunity there could be pretty significant and again, our relationship with Apple could be an advantage there."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"Couple of questions, starting with Health Dynamix, and it's only because this is a new part to y'all's world, but could y'all get a little deeper into what exactly all this encompasses in respect to Quest, HP, and y'all, and how y'all fit into that relationship? And give me some kind of an idea of what kind of a market we're looking at with a partner like Quest.","The partnership that we announced at the beginning of this month is that MedPlus, which is actually a division of Quest Diagnostics, has an EHR software. They've partnered with HP on the hardware side, Health Dynamix on the reseller side, for us to create a comprehensive solution, which is basically the software itself, the hardware that it needs to run on, and then the support, i.e. both our working with the doctors to figure out what they need, and our selling it to them, and then our ability to support it post-that fact. To go out into the world of private practitioners, and really sell that solution versus competitive solutions out there. So you probably know that the world of EHR software is very hot right now. There's a huge whack of federal funding that is starting to flow down to private practitioners to encourage them to go ahead and invest in EHR software to automate their operation. If you look at the data it will tell you that there are approximately 900,000 private practitioners across the United States. The market is young, there's a very small percentage of private practitioners that have actually started the automation process, and so we believe the solution from MedPlus, in combination with HP's hardware, and what we bring to the table, are a pretty compelling value proposition. So what we've agreed to do is we have a dedicated selling effort that is calling into private practitioners. HP and Health Dynamix and MedPlus are all doing marketing. You'll see us pop up at trade shows. You'll see us pop up in direct marketing pieces in the healthcare space that are basically out in the market touting why this is a cool solution. We have the ability to sell the software directly and receive that as revenue and gross profit. We have the ability to sell the HP solution and receive that as well as the services. And so it's a pretty entangled relationship. Quest Diagnostics has a very large footprint in the private practitioner world today, because of their own technology, and so they believe that gives them a leg up in trying to drive MedPlus into that space. So brand new. We're aggressively calling into that market today, and hope that over the course of 2011 and 2012, this will be a significant incremental opportunity for us in the EHR space. So does that give you a sense of what we're doing?"
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"So if I look at Health Dynamix's sales force, what kind of difference in training do they receive than an MME or SMB salesperson? Actually, what I want to know is are they SMB and MME guys trained well enough to be a Health Dynamix sales guy, or is this a totally different guy?","Yes. Well, we have sort of a dual approach into the healthcare space, because as you probably know, the number of healthcare end users in the United States is, you're in the millions, right? And so it's impractical to say that Health Dynamix is going to be effective at selling to millions of end users, no matter how big the sales force is. And the reality is that PC Mall and Sarcom and PC Mall Gov all have existing relationships with hospitals, doctors, clinics, payers, throughout the United States. So what we've done is kind of twofold. Health Dynamix has its own sales force, albeit small today, that is selling directly to a subset of some of the more complex end users. And as you might expect that sales force is very highly trained and really lives, breathes, eats healthcare. That's all they do. Separate and apart from that, we have put in Health Dynamix a number of technical and marketing bodies whose job it is to then go out and train the salespeople at PC Mall, Sarcom, and PC Mall Gov, and enable their capability to sell solutions into their end users. And so while Health Dynamix itself, proper, will focus on the more complex solutions and the more complex end users, PC Mall, Sarcom, and PC Mall Gov all have this Health Dynamix support organization behind them. During the months of August and September we trained all of the salespeople in all three companies. We've developed marketing materials for all three companies. All three companies have a Health Dynamix website on their website. So you could go to Sarcom.com and look at healthcare and see the solutions under the guise of Health Dynamics. And so we actually have a two-pronged approach in the market, which we believe gives us really the most efficient way to reach the most end users in the most cost-effective way possible. And candidly, this is really what's different about what we're doing versus some of our traditional competitors who may have some dedicated websites or pages that may have some marketing slicks. But we have really taken it sort of up a notch in terms of the level of sophistication of the resources that are available, the solutions that are available, and the services that are available. So it's really, in answer to your question, they're not trained as well as the Health Dynamix salespeople. They don't need to be, because they have an overlay organization backing them up."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,And do you know of any other Quest type company or Hewlett Packard putting together a package like this with other companies?,"You know, it's actually a very interesting market, Bill. For example, Ingram Micro, which is one of the large distributors, does have a relationship with [inaudible]. [Inaudible] does have an offering in the EHR space, but I don't know that it's quite as sophisticated or robust as what we're talking about. You'll find that there are other either distributors or large resellers who may have aligned themselves more closely with an EHR provider versus another, but I really don't know anyone that's got dedicated resources and dedicated marketing, that's doing it the way that we're doing it. But that's just what I know."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"Going on to Sarcom and NSPI, kind of the same conversation. When you talk about feeding NSPI services to your legacy customers, would you say that we should look at this in respect - and I know this could be down the road - but would it be a situation whereas you could almost just buy NSPI services by clicking on a SKU?","Yes, actually. So as Frank mentioned, we're at sort of the beginning stages, but those are the things that are actually being developed as we speak. And so you will be a rep at PC Mall, or potentially a customer of PC Mall's, you go to the website, or you have your customized extranet. You could potentially click on a SKU for NSPI and purchase it that way, or call your rep. But absolutely."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"Now let me ask you this. So in respect to your sales force, how much training needs to be done into the SMB and to the MME guys to sell that type of service?","So we are actually in the process of working very closely with PC Mall right now on the SMB side, and doing training, and actually spending time trying to understand the types of tools and support that they need in order to be able to effectively reach out to that market and sell those services. So I'd say if the process is on a scale of one to ten, ten being, you know, you've got a robust revenue stream going, we're probably at step four or five right now, maybe six, but we're well into it, and hope to actually start to see some revenue in the short-term."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"And to clarify the Sarcom business, the service business specifically, y'all do or do not feel like y'all have somewhat come through the trough and things are getting better there as well?","I touched on that earlier. We do have a solid pipeline there, so from an absolute dollar perspective we are definitely working towards growing that business going forward into next year and beyond. But some of that business is project-based, so when you look quarter to quarter it may be a little erratic. That trajectory line should be up still as we go forward. As I mentioned earlier, that business is more contracts-based, there's a contracts-based portion and there is a projects-based portion and the contracts-based portion that kind of helped us in the downturn because we were still performing services under contracts that were signed prior to that decline. But pipeline was a little challenged during that period. And as the economy recovered, we're definitely working toward the stronger pipeline now, or trying to grow the stronger pipeline, but that has caused the services business to lag the products business. Now services growth is never going to be as strong as products growth. You're never going to have 50% growth in services because it's very, very hard. It takes a lot of infrastructure to support that. But definitely, the growth can be strong and it's all in relative terms. So we're very optimistic about that side of the business also."
Bill Dawkins,Frank Khulusi,"And Frank, with 84 reps in the Chicago office to date, what number do you want to get that to?","We're not quoting a number with respect to that, and as you know, and as we've discussed on many calls before, we do have significant turnover in the early stages of a rep's life, specifically in the first year. It is very, very high, and that's the same for a lot of call center activities out there. Now, as these reps graduate from being more of a call center person, cold calling person, into more of an account manager, they tend to stick and the attrition drops significantly. So we're constantly hiring. The net numbers we report are a function of both attrition that's caused by us for people not performing, voluntary attrition by people that just figure out this is not a job for them, as well as the amount of people we're able to recruit in any particular timeframe. And we try to balance between our various call centers as well, because we have needs in various areas, and we have a centralized recruiting force, recruiting for all these call centers at the same time. So in a nutshell, that number will be well north of where it is today, but A, we're not quoting to a particular number right now, nor are we able to actually land the airplane within a very narrow range of a number, even if we wanted to."
Bill Dawkins,Frank Khulusi,"Well, if you were to dissect the 84 people, knowing that some of those 84 people have been in the business possibly with another company, could you give me an average age of experience in the industry?","No, actually there's a mix of people that have experience but there's also a very strong contingent of people that come in green within the industry, and we give them a very high degree of training, and we take them with us on hopefully what will be a long journey with us. So I would say there is no average age that we compute based on experience in the industry. As a matter of fact, some of our strongest performers are green, fresh off the street."
