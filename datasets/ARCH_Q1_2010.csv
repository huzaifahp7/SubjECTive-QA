Sabina Chatterjee,Mike Campbell,"Just given the midpoint of your Q2 guidance and layering in your full-year outlook, to me implies roughly $0.25 of earnings in the back half of the year. Mike, what's preventing you from being more optimistic, especially since you easily doubled that in the second half of ‘09 when conditions were actually much less favorable?","Well, in comparing to '09 you got to remember that urethane’s contract was in the back half of '09 and will be here this year, but there’s still, obviously, if you look at it at the buyer side portfolio, there is more upside than downside. But that being said we’re taking perhaps some more cautious approach in saying that we want to get through the second half because the second half will give us a sense of how the weather patterns or how the consumer demand is shaping up as a result of that. And also we will confirm that the volume demand that we’re seeing in our other Biocides business is being driven by underlying demand and it is not a result of restocking. It feels to me as though the demand is real that is that there is underlying support for the demand and not solely restocking, but I’d like a little more time to confirm that. The second quarter is such an important pivotal quarter to us and there’s so many unknowns going into it in terms of weather and sustainability of demand that we just think it’s more prudent to wait until mid-year to do any re-forecasting."
Sabina Chatterjee,Mike Campbell,"Okay, fair enough. Can you just update us on the M&A pipeline? You briefly talked about Performance Products but what are you seeing in the way of Biocides and if you could just talk to valuation a little bit; has valuation actually adjusted to levels where you feel comfortable with going into the M&A market?","We definitely are comfortable in the M&A market. I’d say thought that it looks as though valuations may be firming up rather than continuing to deteriorate. The bigger issue for us in concluding acquisitions is finding assets that are for sale. Quite frankly, the Biocides arena is a very attractive one. Other people are coming to realize this and they have a greater reluctance to let those assets go. That being said we brought Joe Shaulson in a couple of years back to head up the M&A area and then moved him over to operations and we now have Sarah O’Connor heading that up. And we’re putting a lot of resources behind it. There is a great deal of activity. The frustration is trying to convert that activity into results."
Sabina Chatterjee,Steve Giuliano,"Okay. And just in terms of Forex, can you tell us what sort of benefit that was for both the top line and bottom line?",Regarding the top line for the quarter is about 6% total Arch and from a pre-tax was about $4 million of benefit. It’s not something we expect to continue as we go through the year. It’s that favorable sort of comparison whether weaker dollar this quarter compared to first quarter of ’09. That’s the magnitude.
Ivan Marcuse,Mike Campbell,A couple of quick questions. On the Personal Care and Industrial Biocides business your margins were pretty strong in the quarter. You pointed out that raw materials were favorable and some cost savings from the manufacturing plant. How much were the cost savings? And was that just due to higher utilization in China? And what was sort of the financial impact there? Then raw materials lower; they’ve sort of been trending higher everywhere else. Is there a specific reason they went lower or is it more just the mix or how does that sort of work out going forward?,"Well, we’re not going to break down the specific dollars from each one of those segments, but the cost reduction is a separate positive picture from the plant utilization. In other words plant utilization is not the only driver behind improved costs. It was taking out costs. And in terms of the raw materials those were not huge drivers in the Personal Care and Industrial Biocides area, but they were favorable in comparison to where we were in the first quarter of last year, but that’s not a huge driver."
Ivan Marcuse,Mike Campbell,"So with demand at least looking out at the second quarter, appears from what you’re saying still seems to be pretty strong. It should be stronger in the construction side. It’s going to more seasonality and Personal Care should remain pretty stable. I mean should margin or pass level or profitability be equal to the first quarter going to the second quarter and third quarter or through the year or why wouldn’t it to be?","What we’re waiting to see, Ivan, is certainly the demand in Personal Care was very strong. The demand in Building Products was encouraging. We just want to make sure that this is in an inventory build and is not supported by that underlying demand. And we will have a better field for that I feel in another three months and can better answer your question about what the impact would be in the second half."
Ivan Marcuse,Steve Giuliano,"So with demand at least looking out at the second quarter, appears from what you’re saying still seems to be pretty strong. It should be stronger in the construction side. It’s going to more seasonality and Personal Care should remain pretty stable. I mean should margin or pass level or profitability be equal to the first quarter going to the second quarter and third quarter or through the year or why wouldn’t it to be?","And, Ivan, I was talking a little bit before about the FX benefit, they’re probably half of that $4 million benefit in the first quarter. That’s obviously positive impact on the margins in the first quarter."
Ivan Marcuse,Steve Giuliano,Are you expecting some this year and when would you think it’s going to fall?,We’re expecting to get some rulings on the first peer review and the fourth peer review; we’re looking up both of them in the fourth quarter or at least the latter part of the second half of the year.
Ivan Marcuse,Steve Giuliano,"Okay. A couple of quick questions, with where the Euro is doing now, what’s the impact of the loans on the corporate expense? Like how should we look at it going out for the year? So you had a benefit this year but now the Euro is going against you, right. Or how should I look at that in the corporate expense line?","I wouldn’t from the corporate expense line say anything too much into the Euro. There’s other currencies that are in play there, the pound, I mean it’s also other cross currencies, so…"
Ivan Marcuse,Steve Giuliano,Okay. So would that reverse going into the second quarter or should it remain where it is right now or it’s an unknown?,"It’s a little bit unknown. It’s multiple currencies, multiple loans, but if you look at our corporate costs, Ivan, I think we’re looking at a number that’s going to be close to what it was last year. We’re looking about $32 million to $33 million and I’m thinking it’s going to be roughly a run rate of $8 million a quarter. We had a little bit of benefit from FX this quarter plus a little bit of timing. That’s why it was lower than $8 million, but I think as you forecast ahead it should be in that range."
Ivan Marcuse,Steve Giuliano,And then interest expense; any reason that changes going through the rest of the year should that be about the same?,"We are anticipating that to be higher in the second half of the year. We assume a bit of increase in interest rates, but more importantly, we think there will be some sort of refinancing that we’ll do in the second half of the year that will cause that interest expense to pick up."
Ian Zaffino,Mike Campbell,"Great, thank you. Question would be, Mike, I know you’d mentioned divestitures and you talked about performance, for a while, you were saying you were going to sell and then it was oh, well, look, there might not be any buyers right now given where the market is and we’re just going to (inaudible) for cash. Now, seems like your tone is changing again, but does that mean that just the M&A market right now has opened up and it’s become more amenable for divestitures or is there really a change in your thinking on this? Thanks.","No, I wouldn’t say that there is a change either in some market acceptance or our view of the business I want shareholders to understand however, that we are very focused on moving these businesses out of our portfolio and if anything again starting a couple of years back when we brought Joe in for a strategic development we’ve ramped up the effort in moving these businesses out of the portfolio. We continue to run them for cash. They continue to be cash positive. And that’s going to be an important factor in any valuation that we make from as to any offer we might receive, but my comments I think reflect more not a change in strategy, but a heightened level of activity to execute on that strategy."
Christopher Butler,Mike Campbell,"Wanted to ask for pool chemicals on the mass retailer side, do you have any early indications of success of moving to the garden center or we still coming out of winter here?","We’re still coming out of winter, I mean, obviously, we’ve got and early look at April sales versus March sales, but although you forecast entire sales in April than you do in March, the real demand comes in May and June and then into the third quarter of course, but we don’t have enough data yet to give us clear insight as to how the second quarter is going to shake out in the mass segment. It really requires looking at May and June. Let me just make a further comment. I will tell you that the transition to lawn and garden has gone very well. We’re very impressed by the buyers there and their understanding of the market and how they’re managing their inventory and they understand the seasonal rush, they’re used to that seasonal rush. There could have been some bumps in the road in making that transition within the customer, but it’s gone very, very well and we’re very happy about how it’s gone."
Christopher Butler,Mike Campbell,"And looking at your guidance, I know you had said that there were some purchases that were made in the second quarter that normally take place in the first quarter. With the full year guidance in mind, is there any concern that the second quarter could be strong with sort of a weaker third quarter as a result?","No. No, I don’t think so. I think that the way lawn and garden is managing their inventory, they’re managing it, as I said in my prepared remarks, more consistent with consumer seasonal demand. And consumer seasonal demand really ramps up in May and continues into the third quarter. So we are not forecasting that we’re going to be stealing sales from the third quarter and pushing it into the second quarter."
Christopher Butler,Joe Shaulson,"And shifting gears to the Wood Protection, we had a PolyOne Conference Call this week, they make vinyl and PVC, heavily exposed into housing and they indicated that the normal seasonal strengthening that they have from the first quarter to the second quarter, may not take place this year just due to only a slow improvement to housing-related demand, is that kind of the way the things are working out for Wood Protection as well?","Chris, I think we see that we probably don’t disagree with the assessment that the improvement in demand is a slow one. Having said that I think we do expect to see some seasonal improvement in the business, just owing to the change in the environmental condition, you tend to see more building activity even if it’s happening at a relatively low rate, compared to historical rate."
