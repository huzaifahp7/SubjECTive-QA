Taylor Zurcher,Anthony Gallegos," Hey, good morning, and thank you. Anthony, I wanted to start by asking a question about one of your comments on the Haynesville. I mean, clearly you've been a big player there. And for the past several years and the natural gas outlook has at least improved somewhat over the past several weeks and months. And so just curious what the nature of any potential discussions you're having with customers in the Haynesville are like today? I mean, are those discussions that you've been taking place today or is it too soon? And do you expect some uptick in rig count in the Haynesville towards the latter portion of 2020?"," Yes, Taylor, thanks for the question. Great question. It's good to talk about something positive. But yes we have had and continue to have discussions with customers over there. Both current customers in other words people that we are working for today, or just recently worked for, and then some additional ones that we've continued to stay in contact with over the last couple of years.As I think about the rest of the year, I mean, that's the one area where there's some optimism at least for the next couple of quarters. From my perspective, look, I'm encouraged by what you see happening in the commodity. You look at what expectations are in terms of associated gas. And what's going to happen there as wells shut in, which is happening as you know. I think there's reasons for some optimism, not just for the industry but specifically for ICD, here over the next couple of quarters.So yes, I am optimistic. There are discussions that are underway. I think that is some upside to some of the numbers that we think about over the rest of this year. Obviously, it's optimism, cautious optimism just given what's happening big picture. But I love the position that we're in. As we've stacked rigs, just so you know, we have strategically stacked some up in that area. Again on the assumption and expectation that it puts us at an advantage as we continue to talk to these customers as the rest of the year plays out.",,,,,,
Taylor Zurcher,Philip Choyce," Got it. That's at least encouraging. My follow-up is just on the current liquidity position. Right now, you've got $11 million drawn on the revolver. And it sounds like you'll tap into the $15 million accordion on the term loan at some point moving forward. And if we look at the debt covenants that you have in the revolver today, clearly the availability on the revolver will come down with receivables. But do you expect -- will need to put the $11 million you have drawn into the accordion, or do you expect that $11 million to be relatively safe from a debt covenant perspective over the course of 2020?"," Hey, Taylor, this is Philip. There's two debt covenants that we've got. One is in our term loan. There's a minimum, $10 million minimum liquidity covenant and there's a springing fixed charge covenant, that doesn't come into play in the revolver until we have less than $4 million of availability. So we're not there yet. We will be hard -- we will bring cash into the business as rigs stack and working capital.So that cash, some of that will pay down the revolver -- the revolver balance now. So we'll -- we just don't see the revolver as a meaningful source of sourcing. It will support the operations of the business, but it won't source our non-operating expenditures, just because the availability is going to come down. We will have to pay part of that revolver balance back as our rigs come back. But we will be getting cash in to do that as well, as our working capital converts to cash.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Kurt Hallead,Philip Choyce," Yeah, indeed. Appreciate the commentary, maybe just following-up on that line questioning. Specifically on the working capital front Phil. What kind of a cash contribution are you expecting on a full-year basis from working capital?"," From -- as it goes down, yes, it's about -- I'd say each our operating rig is probably $600,000 to $700,000 of positive working capital. So you're going to harvest that much cash, say, as we go moving from the 17 rigs or so at the end of the quarter that we had operating down to the six rigs that we expect. I don't have to -- I've done the math exactly in front of me. But it would be something like that that we would -- that cash would come in the door.",,,,,,
Kurt Hallead,Philip Choyce," So $600,000 to $700,000 from rigs. So you go from 17 down to six, so 11 times whatever $600,000 to our working capital contribution.",Right. That' correct.,,,,,,
Kurt Hallead,Philip Choyce," Okay, great. You guys referenced, you tapped into the CARES Act for the loan here payment protection loan. So I'm assuming that shows up in your debt balance as you go into the second quarter. So, should we look -- when do we think the aggregate debt balance is going to be as we move forward about $150 million does that sound about right?"," Well, it would be what we have today, plus the $10 million we just borrowed under the CARES Act. And then you got the $11 million at March 31, that we would start paying that down with the cash that comes in on the working capital release, we'll use some of that to pay down. So that will probably get you close.",,,,,,
Kurt Hallead,Anthony Gallegos," Okay. And then Anthony in the context of exiting the quarter at six rigs, again, coming back around to the prior question maybe about natural gas basins or otherwise. What kind of discussions are you having with respect to putting some rigs to work above and beyond that six in the second half?I guess look, I'm very well versed on the fact that every E&P company is pretty much shutting down during the course of the second quarter. There have been some conversations or some commentary from E&Ps about to maybe increasing activity, if WTI were to get back into $30 range. So just curious on your end, do you think you're going to flat line a fixed range for the rest of the year? And do you think there's a prospect, you could put one or two rigs back to work through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter?"," No. I think it's -- it is the latter Kurt. Look, everything you just laid out is consistent with what we're hearing. When I hear these inbound one question that comes to my mind is, is it a drilling engineer that's trying to justify our position, or are they truly business opportunities there?And the thresholds in terms of commodity that we hear customers talk about is kind of $2 gas and a $30 WTI, at above those levels there's -- at least rigs aren't going to get released. There's some stuff on the margin that -- it feels like and sounds like our customers would increase activity.Just given the nature of the people we're talking about, like I said, it does include current customers. In some cases, it's incremental rigs. In other words, they're picking rigs up that they've dropped earlier this year or late last year. And in some cases, it would be new opportunities for the company where we may have an opportunity to displace a competitor.As you said or as it was said earlier, ICD has a very strong reputation in the Haynesville. It's a reputation and a business that we've built ourselves. It didn't come through an acquisition or anything like that. And we get a lot of inbound calls and inquiries from customers as they think about activity over there.So, you look at some of the rigs we've had running they've performed exceptionally well. They're very safe. They're very efficient. Crews have been together a long time. So as customers think about go forward operations, obviously we're in the mix. And I think in some ways and in some cases certainly, I think we're at an advantage.We just need to see the opportunity evolve into a contracting opportunity. And I am optimistic that we will have some wins in that area. Obviously like you said right now, second quarter there's not a lot that's going to happen. But the opportunities that we're talking about are kind of July, August and beyond and we'll see how the summer plays out. But I think, I would say that things are lining up that I would expect us to put a couple of rigs back to work up there later this year.",,,,,,
Kurt Hallead,Philip Choyce,Great. And then just one last follow-up. Do you expect to be EBITDA positive during the second -- during the remainder of the year?,It's going to depend on how many rigs are running Kurt and we just don't know the answer to that. If it's less than six that's going to be a challenge. If it's more than six then we've got a chance to do that. But it's going to -- there's a lot of variables in that.,,,,,,
Ryan Pfingst,Anthony Gallegos,Just a follow-up on your customer conversations. For customers that might want to continue drilling are you guys having more discussions around different pricing models instead of maybe just seeing outright day rate cuts?," Yes. I think most people are looking at this straight up day work model Ryan when we talk to them. Like everybody, we've been interested. We've even had a couple of performance based contracts. We like it. Obviously, there's got to be some upside in the arrangement for us. But right now, I would suggest that most customers are looking at every way as possible to lower their cost. And I think more of them are focused on the day rate -- day work type model today.",,,,,,
Ryan Pfingst,Anthony Gallegos," Got you. Thanks, Anthony. And in your prepared remarks you mentioned in consolidation what are some of the paths you guys could potentially take on the M&A front in this kind of environment?"," Well, I mean not any cash buyers out there right? So you have to be focused on the big picture. The big picture in my mind is more capital efficiency that would result from the consolidation. You think about it -- there's half a dozen companies or maybe there's more that all kind of dozen, two dozen of type rigs in their fleet. We're all spending $10 million to $15 million a year in SG&A. We're all pursuing the same customers. We're all working with the same vendors.And look ICD has demonstrated now a very good ability of being able to do this and bring out every bit of synergy opportunity that's there. And as we think about the reasons it's probably on a relative value basis that you get something like that done. It has to be. Debt when you look at opportunities the debt load on the company has -- obviously gets factored into that. There are social issues that have to be resolved as well.But my point in bringing it up on the call is that, look we've been banging this drum for a while. We think it's necessary. We think what's happening now in the industry is going to force some hands. And we're optimistic about our chances of trying to get some consolidation done.",,,,,,
Ryan Pfingst,Anthony Gallegos,Can you guys give a little more detail on how cost structure initiatives are going to affect the daily operating expenses through the rest of the year? Maybe if you guys get more rigs to work are we going to see the costs come down and stage...," Yes. So, yes, operating -- how many operating rigs does matter as far as fixed cost absorption goes. For our guidance, for the second quarter we were at 13.6 to 14. I would expect that to come down a little bit even at say, six rigs. And if that's what it was in the third quarter, we're running obviously, if we're running more than that then it's a little better if running less then it's a little worse. But yes, if we can get -- the more rigs we get back to work then clearly there's fixed cost absorption that helps us out.One of the things, we are dealing -- going to have to deal with actually they're stacking costs this quarter that are substantial as a rig comes in the stack. But then there's the ongoing lease payments we make where we stack the rig and there's some maintenance you'll do on the rig to keep the engines running and things like that. As you go forward that's going to impact our cost per day as well and create some inefficiencies in this environment.",,,,,,
Daniel Burke,Philip Choyce,Really just a couple of small ones left on the liquidity front. You referenced three early terms. It didn't sound like those were included in the contracted count or the exit of six count and there's probably not much duration associated with those contracts. But how do you – how are we accounting for the cash flow associated with the early terms in the Q2 guide? And is it worth mentioning those dollars?," So when we gave the revenue per day and the operating rig count and the cost per day, we excluded anything out about those early terms. The revenue we're going to get on the early terms between $1.5 million and $2 million, that's probably going to be offset by the stacking costs that we have that are coming in.We're going to have a large number of rigs come in that you've got to put new preservation on and things during the quarter and that's going to be a chunk of change. And there's some furlough opportunities that we're able to take for our employees during the quarter as a result of getting the CARES Act loan that those costs will probably offset the early term revenues during the quarter.",,,,,,
Daniel Burke,Philip Choyce,"Okay. And I might have missed this is stack cost in your op cost per day?
","No it's not. No it's not. The preservation...
",,,,,,
Daniel Burke,Philip Choyce," Okay. And then maybe one other one. Just in – you have the PPP funds and diligent in how you use them. But when we think about the use of the accordion as well as you highlighted is that – should we think of that as really just offloading current borrowings on the revolver, or will the accordion also be needed to fund in addition to that ongoing cost of the business? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much – in a way it's a question about free cash flow."," Yes. I think the accordion is going to be important and the money can be fungible here. But if you're booking it in the buckets, the accordion is going to be really important for our non-operating expenditures as we look forward. And we'll look to draw it down as slow as possible because it's expensive cash. But it will be important as far as funding non-operating expenditures is kind of how I think about it.",,,,,,
