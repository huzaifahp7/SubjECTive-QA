Tore Svanberg,Patrick Henry,"Yes, thank you and good quarter. Two questions, first of all, could you talk a little bit about the Verizon FiOS service? It looks like you are expecting that business to be down about 20% sequentially again in the March quarter. When would you expect that to start stabilizing, especially given that there are now launching their new marketing efforts?","Thanks, Tore. We are anticipating that – they are basically at the bottom and they are turning it around based on kind of soft feedback we have from them. We won't know until the end of the March quarter kind of how things turn out, but I think that the new promotions that they are running which are based on – giving away the free DVR server, lot of Quad Play bundling, more aggressive pricing, a lot of these things seem to be getting some initial traction and the initial kind of soft feedback we are getting around that is quite positive. So although we're going to experience some more difficult in Q1 based on their Q4 results, we are hopeful that towards the end of Q1 or definitely in Q2 we should start seeing a little bit of a recovery in that business.",,,
Tore Svanberg,Patrick Henry,"Very good. And moving on to Comcast, looks like they are pretty committed to MoCA, maybe some potential deployments in 2010. If they do deploy in 2010, when would you potentially have to start seeing some of that business?","Yes. We can't really comment specifically on unannounced cable MSO deployments. I think we have said generally, we expect in the second half cable to be a bigger growth driver in the overall MoCA business for us and cable operators typically go slow before they goes fast. Generally, within the cable MSO world, right now, we are seeing (inaudible) moving to kind of some soft marketing launches and then I think we will start seeing geographic launches within the next quarter across the cable MSOs. But early second half is where I think we have the potential to really see that as a bigger growth driver for us.",,,
Tore Svanberg,Patrick Henry,"Very good. And then moving on to DIRECTV and their MoCA deployment, it looks like there is an 18 million unit opportunity there. How should we expect that to ramp through time? Is that similar? Is it fairly slow in the beginning or do you think you already started to see some meaningful units already in the first half of the year?","Yes. I don't know if DIRECTV talks specifically about their launch plan. Typically, what they'll do is they're launching some percentage of the US with a new technology, maybe a third or half of the US and then over the next quarter, pan out to a nationwide type of a launch. So I think that business is going to continue to ramp for us throughout 2010 and possibly in the 2011. One of the things that really bodes well for the company is I think we are also seeing a really big ground swell or purchase of HDTVs which basically is the precursor to people upgrading their Pay-TV service from standard def to high def service. So most of the products we are going into really are going to benefit from consumers upgrading their service from standard def to high def service and this is with DIRECTV, this is also what Verizon, but also with the cable MSOs. So I think that provides us a good opportunity as that part of the market continues to expand.",,,
Tore Svanberg,Dave Lyle,"Very good. And then just lastly on the outdoor satellite business, it has been pretty strong in the last couple of quarters. How do you expect that business to track going forward? Is it going to be some potential lumpy growth or do you expect that business to show more steady growth there in 2010?","I mean, we're – (inaudible) we have a few planes going over, that's why I keep passing everyone. So, I guess we are in the flight pattern today. The satellite business generally, seasonally strong period in Q4 and Q1, usually a little bit seasonally softer in Q2 and that would be especially the case for our run rate business at EchoStar. And the case for the DIRECTV business, we are ramping there into – from kind of the high-end HD market to all HD. So, we are going to continue to see expansion in that in Q1. Unclear exactly how that's going to look in Q2 at this point, but we also see international satellite service providers starting to deploy CSS later this year as well. So I'd say generally throughout the year that should be a growing business for us. We might see a little bit of softness in that business in Q2 though, because that is a seasonal soft quarter especially for the big tier-one guys.
",,,
Daniel Amir,Patrick Henry,"Thanks a lot. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple of questions here. In terms of the – assuming that Verizon starts coming back as you'd previously answered in the question, what type of revenue base do you think we should be at the end of the year in terms of breakdown in telco, cable and satellite? Is cable going to be bigger than the telco side, or is the telco going to be bigger than the cable by the end of next year?","Yes. I know it's – we really don't kind of break things down like that and we really don't want to provide guidance beyond the current quarter. I would say generally, if you look historically when Verizon was our only deployment of MoCA, they represented north of 70% of the overall revenue of the company. As we kind of moved into this Q4 period, they lost than half of that in terms of our overall revenue. And I think even with the spring back in Verizon, the other businesses are going to be growing at a more rapid clip. So the Verizon component of our overall business is maybe a third of our business and decreasing from there. I think the satellite opportunity and the cable opportunity each are as big as the Verizon deployment over time. So, we should see pretty uniform distribution and diversification of our revenue across the MoCA business, while at the same time, we are also seeing pretty substantial growth in our non-MoCA produce lines as well. So I think generally, we are going to see continued diversification of the revenue stream across multiple service providers and multiple products.",,,
Daniel Amir,Dave Lyle,"Okay. And with relates to kind of the next wave of MoCA and beyond, multi-room DVR, it seems like MoCA as a technology really cornered the market here in the US But kind of the IP delivery side, I guess there is kind of other technologies that have started taking off, it's WiFi et cetera. I mean, what needs to happen or what and when it needs to happen, do you think that MoCA really starts going into that next phase?","I think that this is specifically in the over the top video delivery service market so as multiple components in the third wave of growth. The first one is kind of the over the top opportunity, the second one is the move of traditional pay TV service providers from the current video delivery mechanism, the modern IP-based video delivery, and then the third components are really international. So, on the over the top feeds, I think you are seeing WiFi as being kind of the predominant technology out there today. We are really in the early adopter market for that part of the business and I think the focus right now in over the top pay TV service providers is first and foremost to get their application embedded in as many consumer electronic products is possible. So if you look at the Netflix streaming service as an example, they are now in PS3, they are in Xbox 360, they're now even in Wii. Vizio [ph] announced at CES that they are now in most of the major branded TV manufactures, with the exception I think of Panasonic and Sony. So that's kind of the first and foremost objective is given in as many platforms as possible. The second thing that they are focused on is to get the consumer to at least use the service once. And as it turns out, if you include WiFi as opposed to just including an Ethernet jack, the attach rate of people actually trying the service at least once is about 2X. So, WiFi definitely provides that immediate benefit of saying, okay, somebody is going to try the service, at least use it and see how it goes. The disadvantage of WiFi is really going to be evidenced as you start moving through the mainstream part of the market where the quality expectations of video are basically set, and the bar is set by their current incumbent pay-TV service providers. So, just start having more streaming sports content and more things where people have a quality viewing experience get us back on the use of services, unless you have a high quality FatPipe that delivers the video quality very reliably. I think that's going to take a couple of years and that's when MoCA really starts to get additional traction. We did start having initial conversations with TV set manufactures. These are obviously confidential customer discussions, so I can't mention customer names, but where TV set manufacturers are starting to come to us about plans to embed MoCA in TV sets over time. In a similar timeframe, we see the potential of incumbent pay-TV service providers like DIRECTV with our view moving to more of the same client architecture which also has the potential to push MoCA into TV sets, and also in a similar timeframe like in Northern Europe, where there is coax infrastructure and Europe will really lag the US in both DVR and HDTV deployment by a couple of years. We see an opportunity for MoCA to deploy there. So we see multiple things happening that drive that with the biggest factor being this IP video distribution and the need for quality of service.",,,
Ruben Roy,Patrick Henry,"I had a question sort of focused on Verizon, when you have other exciting ramps starting, but just when you talk about potentially seeing some sort of recovery end of Q1 maybe in Q2, can you elaborate a little bit on your assumptions there. Are you expecting some sort of bounce back in sub growth or just kind of a flat lining of the declines that we have been seeing, kind of what you're expecting?","Verizon's public comments have really been continue to focus on a million new – net new sub adds a year. So that would translate to about 250,000 a quarter. They did 300,000 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 last year and then they did I think 200,000 in Q3 and 150,000 in Q4. So, they ended up doing a million last year as well, but a little bit slow on the back half. I think with the promotions that they are running that say that they are getting initial success, I think it's trending more towards that kind of run rate type of a business, which should be somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000. As they have kind of gone through the slower period over the last couple of quarters, they have continued to order less and they are keeping inventory positions pretty tight. So there should be a spring back associated with that at some point. When accounting on that and our numbers that we provide for guidance for Q1, so if that happened in Q1, there could be some potential upside. But, assuming that they did get that kind of bounce back in Q1, we should see a Q2 bounce back pretty strong for us because there is not – like there is a ton of excess inventory in the channel and they continue to ratchet it down to kind of whatever the current run rate is.",,,
Ruben Roy,Patrick Henry,"Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then just one another question around the comments that you made on the CSS technology, HDTV and then the fact that you have demonstrated compatibility between obviously your CSS solution and your MoCA solution, is that something that you think ends up being a hurdle for other eventual MoCA competitors or maybe is a better way think about that perhaps thinking that it's just another step being qualified, and that gives you some extra insurance I guess in the near term HDTV, any details on what your – what you can say there?","Yes. I mean, that is a really long-term barrier to entry to other MoCA suppliers. I think other MoCA suppliers will eventually be able to support portions of the DIRECTV deployment. Historically, at least, when DIRECTV launched a new set-top box platform, that platform stays around for a while. So, it's more of one when (inaudible) in the next landing zone from a design cycle is. So, I think we have got a good runway in front of us, well in basically every set-top box that has MoCA in it at DIRECTV for quite a while, although we are not starting a fight for kind of the next generation. So I don't really see it as a long-term barrier to entry. But the thing that is kind of interesting about us that kind of make your question when we think about this, is that there are opportunities outside of DIRECTV in the international markets where they are starting to move towards single wire technologies using CSS. And as those markets start to move towards multi-room DVR and HDTV, the MoCA-CSS combo has significant benefits in those other geographies. So kind of the system works that we have done allows us to fan out to additional opportunities over time. And the other thing that counts as a benefit there is all of the major set-top box manufacturers that support the DIRECTV deployment now have products that they can then start to socialize with other international satellite service providers using MoCA. So you get some leverage off of the tier one design into some of the other opportunities internationally. So I think all those things end up being pretty positive for both our CSS business and our MoCA business longer-term.",,,
Sandy Harrison,Patrick Henry,"Hey, don't know if you guys had a chance to kind of digest and look through the recent announcement by one of the competitors in the MoCA chip space, and an acquisition in sort of a tangential technology in the set-top box upon [ph], what's sort of your immediate reaction on that? Is this more to be read into that about perhaps a change in strategy or even an acknowledgement of falling behind?","I think you are probably talking about Broadcom's recent announcement of acquiring Teknovus.Okay. So, I think that just rounds out another portion of products lines that they want to be involved in. Historically, Broadcom didn't have an EPON or 10G-EPON product. They think they developed a GPON product internally, which is used and they are going after basically the Alcatel-Lucent business internationally and also at Verizon with their GPON product. EPON is used in some other international geographies and we are starting some – to see some initial indications from service providers, cable service providers that may want to deploy deep fibre architectures where 10G-EPON could be an important technology. So, it's really kind of (inaudible) for us to some extent move or partner with PMC-Sierra and kind of the EPON and 10G-EPON space really more around our Access business because Verizon using GPON. So, we basically partner with BroadLight for the GPON business in Verizon and they'll partner more with PMC-Sierra for the EPON and 10G-EPON. So, not really directly related to us, but I think it just rounds up some additional products that Broadcom feels like they need to be in for their telco access space.",,,
Sandy Harrison,Patrick Henry,"What you think with them, Broadcom now occupying more of the silicon within the set-top box, what do you think customers' willingness to continue to give Broadcom even more geometry within the set-top boxes from that perspective?
","All in key stuff [ph] that GPON or EPON silicon really doesn't go into the set-top box per se. It goes more into a separate product which is more of an optical network terminal or an ONU, an ONU in the case of a multiple dwelling unit or an OMT in case of a single-family unit. So, it really doesn't give them additional real estate there. Broadcom is a big player in DSL and they are already in GPON. So I think that EPON stuff really kind of rounds out the overall set of products that they can sell into the carrier access market. So that's unfair. It's more orthogonal [ph] to us. They are already kind of in the set-top box as fees paid, so their integration strategy with MoCA around there is something what we have known about when dealing with for quite some time, so doesn't really change the competitive dynamic for us.
",,,
Sandy Harrison,Patrick Henry,"Got you, thanks. And then kind of some of the things you are seeing in China in the c.LINK products, any sort of change in the dynamics of those markets in some of these newer technologies and then some of the broadband really start to reach 10-gig in the basement and other areas like that?","Most of the stuff we're seeing in China right now is that there is a commitment by the government to really try to strengthen the cable MSOs to be an alternative broadband access service provider to the major telcos. So, that kind of bodes well for what we are doing there. Coax is definitely the access solution of choice for the cable MSOs and there is a couple of different Ethernet-over-Coax technologies that are being trialed, our c.LINK access being one of those. And there is currently not really a bake-off, but kind of a technology comparison going on with the various different solutions. So, I think over the next year, we are going to see that play out, is that going to be a big opportunity for anybody and specifically is that going to be a big opportunity for Entropic. But it seems like we're doing all the right things that kind of position ourselves well for that market and (inaudible) for big revenue this year, but definitively it's like a call option where we're continuing to fund that activity to see if it could potentially get big.",,,
Alex Gauna,Dave Lyle,"Thanks very much. I know you have addressed this in a number of different ways, but I am a little bit unclear in terms of the business going into Verizon for the current March quarter, are you expecting it to be down sequentially from December? And did I hear right that perhaps less than a third of revenue is what you are looking for, is that correct?","Yes. We are not breaking out specifically (inaudible). It's roughly a third of our business in Q4 and it's going to be sequentially down in Q1. Verizon's sell-through from a net subscriber adds, we are down about 25% Q3 to Q4. So, we will see something similar in Q1 for us. Despite that, we still feel comfortable with the guidance we are providing which gives like 3% to 5% top-line growth",,,
Alex Gauna,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then in terms of your visibility or backlog coverage for the current quarter, do you need to do any turns business to get your guidance and typically what kind of lead time you get from Verizon, if you don't mind me asking?","So within the current quarter, we have really good visibility. We have several lot of [ph] turns business, but generally we have great visibility in the current quarter. Part of our turns business is because we are in the Motorola hubbing program. So, we recognize revenue on so out of the hub and so into the hub. That creates some level of churns business for us. Also, our chain of business have some level of churns component associated with them. But generally, we feel like we have really good visibility in the current quarter and we feel that way about this quarter as well. As far as Verizon goes, Verizon isn't a direct customer. They (inaudible) with guys like Motorola and Actiontec and Alcatel and people like that, and then those are our direct customers. So we typically get like a 12 month rolling forecast. We have 16-week lead-time that we quote to our customers. They usually don't kind of filling out of those, but we usually have pretty big coverage to our lead time. So generally, customers are pretty good about at least giving us 12 to 13 weeks sort of thing. Am I [ph] right, Dave?",,,
Alex Gauna,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then if I could follow that of last one, you talked about a number of different moving pieces to seasonality and new product ramps for the June quarter. At this juncture, let's say holding Verizon steady and assuming no recovery, and I know you said you saw promising signs. With all the moving pieces, will you expect enough sequential June [ph] at this juncture?",We don't provide guidance more than one quarter out.,,,
Hamed Khorsand,Patrick Henry,"Hi guys. Just a couple of questions. Could you just walk through this DIRECTV MoCA deployment? DIRECTV use three chips for their outdoor unit. This MoCA, will it be just one chip for every set-top box that's deployed that's MoCA enabled, could you just walk me through that?","Yes. So, basically in a multi-room home which is going to be a HDTV home in the case of DIRECTV, we would get SWM enabled DISH antenna so that is three CSS chips. And then on average in US homes, you have three TV sets. Assuming every one of those is connected to DIRECTV servers, we'd get three set-top boxes, typically a DVR and then a couple of HD clients. So, that would be three MoCA chips in that home as well.",,,
Hamed Khorsand,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And as far as DIRECTV and MoCA, is DIRECTV rolling out MoCA enabled set-top boxes for all subscribers or the particular segment?",The boxes that they announced are in HD DVR and in HD clients. So it's really focused on the HD portion of the market where they are going to provide multi-room capability.,,,
Hamed Khorsand,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And as far as AT&T goes, AT&T is using different technology, but they are going to the Solo set-top box refresh. Will they move away from HPNA or do you think they'll just stay with that technology?","They have a stated goal to move away from Home PNA towards the ITU G.hn standard which is still on the draft format. So, the timing of them kind of moving to that, we'd like if they did, would be in kind of the – probably the 2012 timeframe. That's definitely an opportunity that we would like to pursue with MoCA 2 and we are focused on having a dialog with AT&T around that. But their current plan of record is definitely to move away from HPNA to something else in the current stated goal that they have to go to G.hn.",,,
Hamed Khorsand,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then as far as your Chinese testing goes, you have been talking about this for a while, but is there any progress at all, are we really just waiting for final regulatory approval?","Yes. I mean, we have progress, so we will continue to ship more units into three or four different MSOs over there. So this Access business is typically go pretty slow before they really take off. Based on the current kind of calendar that we are looking at from an approval standpoint, I think we will know a whole lot more if they're going to really going to go rush [ph] on this until latter part of 2010.",,,
Hamed Khorsand,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then lastly, as far as revenues go, this amount of revenue growth you have seen these last two quarters, Q4 and Q3, well you are projecting Q1, do you think you are at risk of some lumpiness with inventory build-up, or do you think that this (inaudible) is going to help you see sequential growth throughout the year?","I will not provide specific guidance on the current quarter. I would say, generally if we look at it from a market standpoint, we should be growing throughout the year, because we're ramping into new deployments. The Verizon business seems to be kind of at a bottom from a run rate standpoint. So if we do get any kind of movement there, it's going to be upside movement. Currently, the way we're looking at, that's kind dampening in our growth a little bit because we kind of happen to grow through some software in the Verizon business. But if you look at the other MoCA based service provider deployments, we have multiple log in there, all kind of in a ramp stage. So we feel pretty good about the future from that standpoint.",,,
Aalok Shah,Dave Lyle,"Hey, guys. Couple of quick questions. Dave, on the gross margin, the guidance range 52.5% to 53.5%, the mix there I am sure is somewhat dependent on that, if you get to the higher end of the range, can you give us a sense of what you are thinking about that at this point? Is it definitively favoring more CSS or is MoCA now also kind of up to where the gross margins are for where CSS is at this point?","Sure. First of all, our long-term gross margin range is 50% to 52%. And we have been on the top end of that and are now exceeding it for several quarters now. So clearly the DBS ODU business which has higher margins in the RF product is contributing in a little bigger way than the other product lines. Going forward, I think it's really going to depend on how fast the ramp on the MoCA side actually happens. We thing we're going to continue to get growth out of DIRECTV as we penetrate further with CSS. But I think the MoCA market in general has a larger stamp, so there is potential there for that part to increase. I think at the end of the day, we're going to be able to hit somewhere in the 50% to 52% range quarter-to-quarter for at the foreseeable future.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then in terms of Verizon, can you walk us through a little bit of – I know you have had a quite a bit history now with them. But, in terms of quarters where they have done massive promotions, is there kind of a take rate that you guys – kind of a lag period that you see before the promotions really start to kick in terms of your business? Or is there correlation we can make with the promotion history?","Yes. I mean generally, if you just look at sell-through, net subscriber adds, we typically get a one-quarter lag before we get an impact on our business and we have seen that in the last couple of quarters. There have been kind of (inaudible) in terms of net subscriber adds. So, it would really be a June quarter impact to figure a pretty big spring back this quarter in terms of net subscriber adds. They seem to get pretty immediate feedback from the barely new promotions because they start getting sell-through associated with that pretty quickly. So, they seen kind of a medium impact and then we seen it like a one-quarter delay.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,And these promotions really started to begin in earnest what about couple of weeks ago?,"I think we started seeing some stuff around, right after Christmas. They have been pretty gone out for well over a month now.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then in terms of CSS business, I think you guys said there are three to 10% plus customers, two of which were doing CSS. Is the DIRECTV and the EchoStar business done through those two customers that you mentioned for CSS?","Both of those are DIRECTV suppliers. Now in the case of WNC, they do both MoCA business and CSS business.Now, we also supply CSS to other people besides DIRECTV, some of the international satellite deployments. Neither one of those guys are currently EchoStar suppliers, I don't think – are they Dave?",,,
Aalok Shah,Dave Lyle,"Okay. So, in the numbers, it would suggest that EchoStar wasn't a 10% customer, I would assume, correct?","I think there is two or three DISH suppliers at EchoStar today. So, they spread their business across, so it's conceivable that there could be – we don't want to break that out, we're just showing kind of 10%, but there are multiple suppliers to EchoStar.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And then I know you guys don't give us mix between MoCA and CSS, but is there kind of a sense that maybe in the back half of the year, you're going to start to see that mix kind of tour [ph] and then this goes back to the first question, does the mix start to favor MoCA significantly maybe towards an 80/20 mix, is that something we should anticipate?","That seems like it could be a little bit of rich ratio there. I mean, if you look at kind of historically when we just had Verizon, Verizon was about 70%, the satellite outdoor unit product lines was about 25%, and everything else was about 5%. I think what we're going to see over time and it could be – it could vary quarter to quarter is the kind of MoCA business is going to be 60%, 65% of the overall business in other product lines including tuner, satellite and everything else, Access, probably like a third of the business.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,"Okay. And last question, Patrick, in terms of what customers are asking you for, are they hammering you on price more so now that you are starting to pick up some more of these bigger customers, potentially bigger customers down the road? Are they saying, hey, we may start to go to the other supplier down the road, and if you give us a pretty good price, we will lock you in for a year? Can you walk us through kind of how this selling process works right now for MoCA?","Yes. In my experience, customers always want lower prices and they always beat you up on that whenever you see them. But, we feel like, we are negotiating long-term pricing contracts with people, so we have pretty good predictability on price. We rarely provide that kind of long-term perspective. Whenever we win new designs, there is a service provider base, so we have pretty good visibility. We have a pretty good felling that we will be able to stay in our gross margin target range of 50% to 52%, because we continue to invest in the product lines, in terms of cost reductions like moving our MoCA 1.1 products to 65 nanometer as well as the R&D that we are doing around the pre-MoCA 2.0 stuff. So, we felt pretty good about stuff and we feel we have competitive pricing and we continue doing business based on that.",,,
Aalok Shah,Patrick Henry,"Okay. One more quick one. MoCA 2.0, when do you think they're expected to be shipping in volume?","Hard to tell. We haven't even announced the product yet. So, I think that you will probably see, we should look at kind of the – aligned with the kind of third wave of growth in MoCA. In 2012, we will probably start seeing MoCA to start coming into market in that time frame in decent volume would be my guess.",,,
Tim Luke,Dave Lyle,"Thanks. I think most of (inaudible) have been touched on. David, with respect to the way you have been planning your OpEx through the year, how should we be thinking about that from this $15.2 million that you have outlined here?","Right. At this point, we're very focused on increasing profitability quarter-to-quarter. So, we will continue to control OpEx accordingly. That taken out of the consideration, we have kind of grown 3% to 4% per quarter over two quarters and I don't thinks that's unreasonable going forward. But, I don't want to give any guidance until we actually get there.",,,
Tim Luke,Patrick Henry,"I think you talked about in some of the areas seeing some seasonality in the calendar second quarter and I'm just wandering to what degree that may, in further, what the impact of that may be in terms of the broader revenue picture for the progression through the year?","Okay. So, I mean specifically in the satellite business, especially once we are moving to a run-rate like we are with EchoStar, we been kind of in a more mature business state for the last couple of years. That business experience is a little bit of seasonal softness in Q2. With DIRECTV, we are not rolling on a run rate business. We are continuing to ramp CSS and the SWM DISH antenna. So, it's possible you get a little bit of seasonality there. It's possible that we kind of grow through it based on the product cycle that we are in there. And then on the MoCA business, I think we are definitely more in a product cycle type of structure. And then silicon tuners, they have a little bit of seasonal softness in Q1. As we go into Q2, there's definitely not going be anything softer than Q1. So, you probably should see flatter growth. So, I think you can add all that stuff together, you should see growth throughout the year for quarter-over-quarter sequential growth from a top-line standpoint.",,,
Tim Luke,Patrick Henry,Just remind us where you are with your 65 nanometer migration and the new product delivery in the MoCA arena?,"Yes. So we, on the 65 nanometer MoCA 1.1 product, we have been in production since September of last year. We have won some new designs based on that. We are starting to ship production volumes. But we have pretty decent volume this quarter on that product. In terms of the crossover point between that and the existing (inaudible) product, it's really kind of late this year where maybe it gets into kind of the 50/50 state and then kind of migrates into the 65 nanometer completely sometime in 2011, is kind of what we are thinking about right now.",,,
Tim Luke,Dave Lyle,"And you are alluding that pricing being sort of largely as you would have expected, is that what you are saying?","Yes. Pretty much where we expect it. I think we have talked about kind of worse case 25% ASP erosion a year. What we have seen historically is more kind of in the 15% to 20% range and we feel good. In other words, we are conservative there.",,,
Tim Luke,Dave Lyle,"One last question, Dave. You are saying that basic model is 50%, 52% gross margin, but you are now happy of sustaining at 52%, is that correct?","No, I said it's going to depend on mix between the DBS-ODU business and the rest of the businesses. And right now, the mix is obviously saving the DBS-ODU given where the margin guidance is in Q1, after that is going to depend on really how fast MoCA ramps. But even if it ramps in a pretty significant way, we still think we will be in this 50% to 52% range.",,,
Tore Svanberg,Dave Lyle,"Yes, thanks. Two follow-ups. First of all, as you look at the DIRECTV MoCA deployment, will that have similar lag as Verizon, meaning whatever net adds they will have, they will have like a quarter later impact on your business?","Well, right now, we are building product in advance of their launch, and they are launching in some percentage of the US They typically, with other product launches they have done, they're going some percentage of the US and then go nationwide a quarter after that. So, I think you'll see a continued ramp in that business over the next couple of quarters just based on that build-out. Then they typically move into a really seasonal strong area as they get into the fall and kind of through that time all the way through the Superbowl. So I think that that business is going to continue to be a good ramp business for us throughout 2010 and even into early 2011. The thing that could drive growth even further than that is a bigger conversion away from standard def towards high def. Because we're high-def platforms, so as we see more and more consumers move their pay-TV service from standard def to high-def with DIRECTV as well as with everybody else in the industry, I think that's going to favor Entropic MoCA solutions.",,,
Tore Svanberg,Dave Lyle,"Very good. And the other question was, you announced this partnership with Atheros. I was just wondering what type of partnership that is. Is this more of a reference type platform, or are you just working with them on future home networking technologies?","Yes. So, the specific thing we mentioned in Atheros was something we are doing Intellon prior to Atheros acquiring them where we are showing both compatibility as well as bridging capability between MoCA and HomePlug AV, because there is maybe some places in the home where you don't have coax where you are still going to have this connected home experience, and you can use HomePlug to get to those particular sections of the home. So we demonstrated that capability. A big part of what we are showing there is HomePlus AV is really the de facto standard within the powerline space. MoCA is really de facto standard within the coax space. And G.hn is trying to come in and say, okay, we are going to do everything for everybody, kind of solve the world's hunger problem of home networking, and which is not backward compatible with anything. So what we are saying is, hey, there is a technologies already out there today that were backward compatible to installed base. We're working together to ensure that we have solutions that preserve the installed base. We are also providing everything you need in the home.",,,

Is this more of a reference type platform, or are you just working with them on future home networking technologies?","Historically, we have also partnered with Atheros on WiFi to MoCA bridging products as well. So they have been a long-term partner of ours.",,,
