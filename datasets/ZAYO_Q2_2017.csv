Michael I. Rollins,Dan P. Caruso,"Thanks for taking the question. Was curious if you could discuss at how you think bookings should progress over the course of 2017, and if you could discuss in more detail the effort that you're making on sales, the sales force and how that should play out in terms of contributing to the productivity of those bookings? Thanks.","Sure. Thanks, Mike. So the sales during the fourth quarter was $5.4 million. That does not include Canada, and it obviously does include ELI. On a like-for-like basis we expect that the current quarter's bookings will be more in line with what we've seen in kind of recent quarters, so in the $6 millions. The reported number may be in the $7 millions, including what we layer on the communication infrastructure portion in Canada, and maybe a little bit of the ELI if we close before the end of the quarter. So the sales, without changes in the current quarter, are expected to be more in line this quarter with prior quarters than in line with the December quarter.Now having said that, we do see a lot of very strong activity with our very large customers. So the short-term kind of pause in maybe decision making, as we are interpreting it, we do think is very short term. We don't think it's kind of medium term or long term, and we base that based on just the range of dialogue on projects of material scope that we're talking about with many of our customers. So we don't think those will hit in any kind of meaningful way during the current quarter, but we do think the current quarter would be a good quarter. We do expect that those will hit in subsequent quarters.Now over and above that, we do, as part of the integration of the different companies that we're bringing together, we do expect to end up with a sales force that's bigger than the sales force we have right now, maybe by 50% or 60%. But that will be more – that should produce activity more along the broader set of customer accounts as opposed to being linked to the big deal activity. So net of all that is we think that the December quarter will prove to be an anomaly."
Colby Synesael,Kenneth desGarennes,"Great. Thank you. I was curious what the company's appetite is to take on additional M&amp;A perhaps over the next few quarters as you continue with the integration of Allstream and now take on the integration of ELI? And then as it relates to the bookings, Ken, I think at the Citi Conference in early January you talked about how you would like investors to think of you as a 5% to 7% growth company, and if you happen to get up to 10% at some point, so be it, but let's not model that. I think that the bookings of around $6 million would suggest around 5%. Is that how you think we should be thinking about this business as we go forward, or is there still an expectation at some point we actually go higher than that? Thanks.And, all, we are live again.","So I think it wasn't quite a direct quote. I think what I said was something to the effect that we've been a very consistent grower in that 5% to 7% range, and that's probably a reasonable expectation, recognizing that our aspirations are for higher, and we think our ability is for higher. And that's the trajectory that we're on, but that you would start seeing evidence of that. And when you did, that's how you should model it."

Thanks.And, all, we are live again.","Yes. And when we share more insight in March, we're going to wait until we close ELI, but shortly thereafter we'll provide more insight and we'll give kind of more crisp expectations on kind of expected growth rates by segment of the business. As far as the appetite for more M&amp;A, ELI hasn't closed yet, and ELI is a body of work that's going to keep us busy for a little while.Most of the hard work from Canada is behind us, but there's still some additional work we have to do there before it's fully assimilated. And it gets related to ELI because those are very similar properties so some of the grouping that goes together need to take place. So all those together mean the likelihood of us doing a significant M&amp;A event in the very near term is probably low. But you shouldn't take that to mean that we're out of the M&amp;A marketplace for any duration of time. We still are going to want to position ourselves to take advantage of kind of the tail of consolidation that opportunities that are still out there."
Amir Rozwadowski,Dan P. Caruso,"Dan, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you do expect cash flow to be positive and to go up from here with the caveat that if there's any large projects on the horizon, that could change things. What is sort of the visibility on those large projects? Just trying to see if there's a sort of steady state when it comes to cash generation from here?","Yeah. So Amir, if we wanted to have a steady state of cash generation, we can manage the business that way. That can be a goal we set, and if we set that goal, it wouldn't be a hard goal to achieve. It's not the goal we set. The goal we set is to win as many of the interesting projects that are out there for us to win as our capital availability would allow for. Now, I think the way the numbers are playing out is certainly we'll win more larger projects that are in normal course, but more larger projects combined with the set of kind of properties we already have, probably begin to lead to a regular, positive cash flow generation.Now if there's as larger influx of big projects, which there very well might be, in fact there's a lot of dialogue out there about big things to do. If those play their way through, that's going to be good news, because we're going to sign those projects and we're going to implement those projects. You're going to see that when we book them. You're going to see that as capital gets committed, and as a result of that, you're going to see the business grow and the depth and breadth of networks get more extensive. So those will be related, but you'll get all the early warning signals by seeing the bookings number upfront, that's how you'll know kind of what path that we're on."
Amir Rozwadowski,Dan P. Caruso,"That's helpful. And then sort of a bigger picture question here on your vision for the company, clearly you folks have focused on building up a significant pool of fiber assets in order to capitalize on this shared infrastructure business model. However, as you mentioned, it also seems clear that others covet those types of assets, either to expand their own shared infrastructure business models or perhaps utilize them as a means to support their next wave of connectivity solutions.Would you be amenable to partnering with those types of companies should the right opportunity emerge, or do you believe that ongoing consolidation of your asset footprint is sort of the near-term focus for you in order to perhaps increase the value of those assets over the longer term?","Well, I mean you used the word partnering. Partnering is obviously a general term to take on a lot of variety. Basically our business model is to partner with those exact kind of companies. That's what we do. Through shared infrastructure, through being creative, through being responsive to them, we in essence are their partners in helping them get access to the infrastructure that they need. So if you meant something more than that, let me know. But that's kind of the core of what we do."
Amir Rozwadowski,Dan P. Caruso,Perhaps more than that if they were interested in solely owning your assets.,"So if they're interested in acquiring us – we're a public company and we're in this as representatives of our shareholders. That's how we'll always be. There's nothing unique about this point in time. It's not our aspiration. Our aspiration is to build for a long period of time a very unique, independent company that plays a very meaningful role in providing infrastructure for many others. So that's kind of how we're wired. That's certainly where my motivation lies. But I also understand where my fiduciary obligation sits as well. So we would have to be responsive in that type of manner. But that's not what we're looking to accomplish."
Philip A. Cusick,Dan P. Caruso,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Dan, CapEx keeps rising but the growth you outlined a year ago hasn't come through and now you're talking about 10% growth as aspirational rather than the base case. How has a lack of growth impacted your thought process for projects that you're reviewing today in terms of lease up and return on invested capital? And is there a point where that has to if it hasn't yet?","Yes. Let me just first correct a couple things there. One is capital is actually down by $1 million this quarter versus last quarter so it's actually a little bit lower. I think it was (40:02). So actually a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but it's a little bit higher than it's been in past quarters because of big projects that we won that are playing their way through the system. As we said in the last several quarters and I repeated again today, that capital comes in advance of installs. Not by a lot, but as a wave of those projects are being built out, more of the capital is being spent and revenue is catching up and that it will catch up completely as those projects come to fruition. So that pattern continues to play out.Never described 10% growth rate as something that actually would happen. We always described it as something that is our objective. It's something that is our goal, something that we think we can get to. But until we get there we're not there. Until you start seeing based on the size of our business pre-Allstream, pre-ELI, until you start seeing $3 million net installs, then you can't be thinking about this as a high-single digit growth business. You've got to think about us as something less than that based on our net installs so we've been consistent with that as well. Also been consistent that if the growth rate doesn't get up there, what you'd expect to happen is capital spend to go down and cash flow production to go up, and that's consistent with what I said in this discussion as well.So the primary thing that happened during the fourth quarter that was different than prior quarters or my guess would be future quarters is the bookings number was lower and it was related almost entirely to really commitments on really big projects. Again, I think that's not kind of a sign of anything changing, it's kind of a strange set of circumstances that I think are pretty obvious to everyone on the call that culminated over last quarter and is continuing into this quarter as well. But I don't think it will continue in a way that will produce that same result. So I think actually everything we're saying in here is consistent with what we've said in the past."
Philip A. Cusick,Dan P. Caruso,"Okay. I just want to – if I can follow up. If the industry is sort of pausing because of Trump or potential M&amp;A, why did those big bookings rebound so quickly? Are you seeing that rebound already on commitments for the big projects?","Well, the pause is – as we're interpreting what's happening, the pause is – it was probably more pronounced because it was also a holiday quarter. So you have all these things happening but you also – so each of these companies is trying to consider what big moves should it be making. And it's not just related to Trump and M&amp;A, it's also related to the conviction around what 5G is and its inter-relationship with fiber and what's the right way to kind of go forward with that. Well, it's hard to do that kind of strategy work if you're a big company in the December quarter because most people take a good part of December off plus Thanksgiving week.So you probably have some of that – not only did it catch them by – the added elements of Trump caught everyone by surprise, it's also a holiday quarter so the strategic ramping has everyone stewing. And I think everyone on this call is probably intimately familiar with the type of strategic permutations companies are working their way through. It just makes that you're less likely to sign up to big long-term commitments until you have a better insight of what you think the right path forward is. But that's not a six month, one year, one-and-a-half year situation, that's a very condensed situation that plays out, I think, in this environment pretty quickly. Not the final decision because those will take some time, but being caught by surprise and trying to reset what the right path forward is, but then you'll start seeing kind of the ongoing set of activities. The underlying demand of what's driving kind of our business, that hasn't changed."
Philip A. Cusick,Dan P. Caruso,"And so have those commitments ramped back up in the last five, six weeks?","No. I think what I said a couple times is that this quarter that we're in right now I would expect to be a light quarter when it comes to the big commitments, but not light in the sense that the fourth quarter was lightening up, light from bookings being the same vicinity this quarter as it was last quarter. Now it's only mid-February, not even mid-February, so a lot happens in the second half of every quarter. And this is probably no different than other quarters. So recognize that we're sitting here in the first half of February, not at the end of the quarter, so events haven't pulled it right away through. But there wasn't any remarkable change on January 2 relative to this dynamic. It's a gradual change."
Brett Feldman,Dan P. Caruso,"Thanks for taking the question. I know there's been a lot of questions here on M&amp;A and I'm going to ask one more. You've said in the past that the primary reason you experience churn or one of the primary reasons you experience churn in your business is because your customers occasionally consolidate, groom their networks and you lose a little bit of business. And so if that were to continue, it wouldn't necessarily change your view on your outlook for churn.I am curious because there are so many transactions that are being speculated, and I imagine that the impact to you would vary. Is there anything in particular that we need to really keep our eye on? A particular customer that if they decided to pursue a combination, might affect your business in a way that's outside the range of what we would normally model for churn? And then I have a follow-up question after that.","Yeah. Brett, that's a relevant question because there are so many permutations of the combinations that people are talking about. Who knows, maybe nothing happens, but there's certainly an unusually high level chatter going on right now.The other thing that's going on is this kind of high expectation that's universally held of the need for more and more fiber as part of the ongoing solutions for 5G, for cloud and for other interesting business plans that are being worked by our customers. So you have this other effect that the enthusiasm about the role that fiber plays in so many different situations is higher now than I think it's ever been. Now enthusiasm can be a dangerous thing, but enthusiasm tends to be a good thing.So the counter-balance to what might be the aftermath of combinations is the intensified role that fiber is expected to play in so many different situations. So how do you balance those two out, time will tell. But I think in almost – any scenario that I can imagine, if as these events clear their way through, Zayo remains an independent kind of company of the type we are today that we will be in a great situation to prosecute our business plan for years to come. I can't think of some kind of permutations of scenario that would leave Zayo in an awkward situation unless people stopped using mobile devices and bandwidth stopped being important to people's lives."
Brett Feldman,Dan P. Caruso,"Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up question. You talked about how you're in these conversations for very big deals and some of the uncertainty in the sector maybe is affecting the timing. I just wanted to get your read on the competitive environment. Are you seeing anybody show up trying to win these big projects that maybe you hadn't in the past?","No, not really. Crown, obviously, is in deals, but has been for a while. Cable companies are in some of the bigger deals but no more so now than in the past. No, not really. I mean, if anything there's fewer involved in the bigger deals because of consolidation."
Jonathan Atkin,Dan P. Caruso,So I wanted to focus a little bit on churn and how do you think about the relative contributions of hard disconnects versus the repricing impacts going forward? It seems to be dominated by hard disconnects. And does that churn number just grow ratably as the business grows? How do we think about that? And can you give a little bit of color about the product segments that you're seeing the hard disconnects and the repricing churn in?,"I might need a little bit of help there. Sounds like a few extra questions there. So the hard disconnects versus – I'm going to need to get out that chart to be able to answer the questions. Okay. I've got it. Yeah, this quarter – certainly, if you compare this quarter to last quarter, the $4.7 million was driven by hard disconnects being higher, not the other factors like upgrades and price decrease. This quarter there were – whenever you talk about churn, there's always unique things that happen in churn in any given quarter, which means it's always dangerous to say there are unique things this quarter. There were a couple of unique things this quarter that were related to the overall theme of this call but that would've been classified as hard disconnects but were related to some of the kind of grapplings that are going on with some of the big customers. Around the edges, that probably contributed to orders being a bit higher this quarter than last quarter."
Jonathan Atkin,Kenneth desGarennes,So I wanted to focus a little bit on churn and how do you think about the relative contributions of hard disconnects versus the repricing impacts going forward? It seems to be dominated by hard disconnects. And does that churn number just grow ratably as the business grows? How do we think about that? And can you give a little bit of color about the product segments that you're seeing the hard disconnects and the repricing churn in?,"As far as segments, it was pretty – the segments were fairly consistent. They were all slightly elevated. Maybe Network Connectivity more so than the other two."
Jonathan Atkin,Kenneth desGarennes,"Okay. And then quickly on zColo and on small cell, I'm just interested in zColo. Can you provide us just a review what your own unsold capacity is and any kind of revenue growth opportunities in that segment? And then anything to kind of call out in terms of specifically your emerging small cell business?","Yeah, we've been really – we've not published capacity in the Colo in a number of quarters. It's been fairly stable, to be honest. We haven't seen a drastic uptick or downtick in capacity. We have, as you'll see in our network capacity, capital expenditures that we disclosed, you'll see that a – while you'll see that number and I can say that there's a large percentage of that network capacity capital expenditures that relates to expanding Colo facilities and that was certainly the case in this quarter. So all that being said, we continue to expand generally opportunistically around existing facilities, and that's kept our utilization roughly flat."
Jonathan Atkin,Dan P. Caruso,"Okay. And then quickly on zColo and on small cell, I'm just interested in zColo. Can you provide us just a review what your own unsold capacity is and any kind of revenue growth opportunities in that segment? And then anything to kind of call out in terms of specifically your emerging small cell business?","Yeah. We are seeing good healthy activity there. On the small cell business, I mean, small cell is obviously a very active area. It is interrelated to kind of the dialog that we're having on this call. I mean that's the area where there's probably a tightening of a set of activity there now around what each company should do, how they should go out doing it, how that gets affected by various permutations of combinations. Might they do it different if this were to happen versus that were to happen, there's spectrum auctions going on right now? I mean, there's just a lot going on and including companies trying to solve for what are the right commercial terms. And, in some cases, there are deals out there that we're not moving forward with because of the way the commercial terms work. And by commercial terms, I don't necessarily mean just pricing. It can be more structural than that. Structural that in some cases it does a great job of lining kind of our interests to the customers' interest. Like for example, the prior quarter to this quarter was a record sales quarter and that was influenced heavily by mobile infrastructure activity and a commercial structure that was very much a win-win between kind of what was good for us and our shareholders and what was also good for the customer.There's other kind of deal constructs that we've seen out there where I don't think that there's been tight enough alignment between our interests and our shareholders' interests and the customers' that if there's more collaboration on commercial terms that produced a win-win, it would make the deals more interesting to us. And in the absence of that, there's some deals that we're just not comfortable doing. But that's how markets work. Markets have to find, especially when people are not just solving for the here and the now, what they're solving for is what if there's a significant ramp-up in small cells, you have to live with the contracts for a long period of time. If you're the buyer, you're trying to get them as favorable as possible. If you're the seller, you're also starting to think about the long-term implications of the contracts and they've got to find the happy medium."
Frank Garreth Louthan,Dan P. Caruso,"Can you talk us a little bit about your backlog and how should we think about that? I mean, if the bookings are down a couple of quarters and you still maintain your current backlog and you continue to see a lot of the income statement trends we've been seeing, give us a little bit of color there and what's sort of the average time to install the projects that you have in your backlogs?","Yeah. So we report the average time as part of slide 11. If you look at the kind of circular numbers and apply the average days installed. Now the average days installed is about 100 days, but 100 days can be very misleading because it's an average of a lot of different types of projects. A lot of what gets sold gets installed in a matter of days, maybe a few weeks.So a lot of stuff that gets sold this quarter will get installed this quarter, but then there's other stuff that gets sold that takes years to install because it's the tail end of a big buildup. It's the last 25% of kind of a significant build in Dallas or a significant build in Atlanta. So the averaging of 100 days is really a mixed question than how long does it take for something to get installed. If a customer wanted something real quick and it's mostly on net, we're going to get it installed really quick. In fact, we like that because revenue gets turned up a lot quicker.The backlog has been pretty constant over the last five quarters. I mean, if you go back five quarters ago it was $14.4 million, it kind of rose up to a high of $16.2 million, now it's $14.6 million because of the discrepancy between what was installed versus what was sold in the most recent quarter. But my guess is that will trend upward over time not decrease more."
Frank Garreth Louthan,Dan P. Caruso,"Got it. Okay. And can you comment on trends in Europe, and is there any geographic issues with some of the bookings in mostly U.S. customer base issue and how should we think about what the European trends are? Any opportunity for inflection there?","I did not look at Europe versus U.S. so I can't answer that question other than to use intuition, which I won't use in a call like this. But Europe is going well for us, and we're very deep and dense in the U.K. and Ireland, and we're pretty dense in France as well. So then we have a presence across a broader area of Europe, but not with the same density as we have in the past. So we've been putting kind of some of that newer network to work, spending some capital to build out more of 100-gig infrastructure on a wider scale basis. And bookings, were lower in Europe during the fourth quarter than other quarters, but not abnormally lower.The broader Europe landscape, I think there's more noise there than there is in the U.S. ironically. The noise in the U.S. is, I think, concentrated in time based on kind of some very recent events. I think there's a broader set of noise in Europe because there's still more players that the markets are still finding themselves. They still have different countries operate different ways when it comes to communication infrastructure. So ironically, U.S. and Canada have progressed a lot more when it comes to consolidation so I think it's a clearer picture here than it is in Europe."
Nick Del Deo,Dan P. Caruso,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the items that you highlighted that you want to work on internally by strengthening the sales team, how long do you think it will take to get where you want to be, and will it require a bump up in your run rate SG&amp;A expense?","So the answer to the second question is no. And the reason why it won't is because that's just going to be as the dust settles from the combination of Zayo, ELI and Allstream. You'll also see the sales force built out as a result of that. So ironically, you'll see us kind of go through a period that we expect to be kind of good, solid EBITDA progression while also ending up with a kind of more built out sales force so we'll get kind of the benefit of both.The key with building out a sales force, I mean, having more salespeople does not produce better results unless you're doing it with, one, there's a market there that those people can sell into, and two, it's a high-quality set of people. They're good, solid professionals. Well if you want good solid professionals, that starts with having sales executives that are solid, know how to manage that and know how to attract the right people. One thing I can say with a high degree of confidence is that when I look at our sales kind of VP, senior VP layer, it's more consistently strong now than I think I could say ever in Zayo's history with more balance, so more strong players across more of the key positions than we've ever had.So the confidence that we'll be able to – and when I talk about increasing the size of sales force, I'm talking – we have a small sales force today of maybe 120 quota-bearing. Maybe when all the dust settles it's 170 people, including kind of assimilating kind of ELI people into it, building out some of our kind of teams that are a bit understaffed and as someone in Canada (01:00:40) did. So it's not a significant increase but the key is that it's a set of solid people working for solid executives and pretty high degree of confidence as we work our way through this year, that will just naturally happen."
