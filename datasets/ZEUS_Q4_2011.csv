Unidentified Participant,Rick Marabito,I guess can you break out your tons sold for just the fourth quarter for me and then I have a few others as well.,"Sure, I will take that one Mike. So Nate, our fourth quarter tons sold and as you know and we’ve commented we the tons sold reporting is for the flat roll group. So there is no ton included in terms of the tube and pipe group. So in fourth quarter of 2011 our tons sold were 257,000 and in 2010 they were 254,000."
Unidentified Participant,Rick Marabito,And how much of that was direct tons?,"We were 243,000 direct versus 231,000 direct last year."
Unidentified Participant,Rick Marabito,"Okay, and can you, you said that the startup costs in the fourth quarter were $775,000 correct?",Yes.
Unidentified Participant,Michael Siegal,"Okay, and can you, you said that the startup costs in the fourth quarter were $775,000 correct?",Yes.
Unidentified Participant,Rick Marabito,And what are those going to continue into 1Q and how do you see those moving forward?,"Yeah, we as David outlined we’ve got various operations of various size coming onboard. The biggest of our operations obviously is the Gary facility. We are through it David commented most of the startup costs so a big chunk of the fourth quarter startup cost that I highlighted in the $775,000 were related to Gary. So we would see that tapering off, it is tapering off in the first quarter and as David said we are in a cash flow neutral position. Some of our other facilities however at different stages of ramp up, so we commented about Streetsboro, Streetsboro should be up and running in second quarter, so I would anticipate in first quarter we are going to have similar type expenses in Streetsboro probable a little bit more than we had in fourth quarter. And so in summary what I would tell you is that we will have like or slightly less operating expense drag on new facilities and then certainly as we get into second quarter we would see those starting to dwindle."
Unidentified Participant,Rick Marabito,"Okay and then I mean, is that in the warehouse and processing line?","Well, it’s a combination of yes there is some in warehouse and processing as we hire, there is some in administrative costs in terms of getting the facility set up with IT equipment, legal expense, admin expense, depreciation as we open the new facility and install the equipment. So those would be the bigger items in terms of the operating expenses."
Unidentified Participant,Michael Siegal,Can you just kind of remind us of your spot the contact mix and its debt and if there is a big change between sheet and plate?,"Well, I would say we have a growing emphasis for more contract business. Historically we were probably in a more 60-40 we see that growing two thirds, one third. So that’s when David comments about some of the drag of the trailing indexes that allowed the contracts are tied to. And I’m not sure Nate what your specific question is about plate."
Unidentified Participant,Michael Siegal,"No, I would just ask if there is I guess a meaningful variance between sheets exploited.","No, it’s like the heavy highly engineered products seem to be having more momentum a lot of the flat roll products but you know that’s just indicative of the specific demand at the moment."
Martin Englert,Rick Marabito,Question about the SG&amp;A it looks like the percentage versus revenues stepped up quarter-over-quarter the absolute dollar amount was roughly flat to slightly higher at about $53.8 million. What can we kind of expect to going forward should this drop back down to where it was 14.5% to 15.5% of sales or is it going to remain roughly around that 53?,"Well, I think Martin you’ve got tied into the conversation we just had. I would expect first quarter to be pretty similar we had a couple of things as you are looking at the operating expenses as a percentage of sales so we had some of those startup costs that I just went through and I won’t go through those again. And you’ve also had some pricing pressures as David and Michael outlined earlier on the call in terms of fourth quarter that obviously impacts the percentage not so much the true dollars. So as we look at first quarter I would tell you our anticipation is, is that we would have startup costs as I outlined and our operating expenses as a percentage would be pretty similar to slightly less than what we saw in the fourth quarter."
Martin Englert,Rick Marabito,"Okay, but I know you mentioned that a large portion of the startup cost were related to the ramp up of the Gary temper facility, can you provide any more detail as how much was that 75% of the startup costs or 60%?",It was over half.
Martin Englert,David Wolfort,Over half. Okay. Actually there if I could ask one more question as far as the demand did you mention that overall the heavy equipment automotive looks relatively good as effective to grow year-over-year. Any signs of weakness because of the economic weakness and slowdown over in Europe and Asia as well as part of the export demand for that equipment.,"Martin, I will take that and David here and the answer the short answer is no as a matter of fact as I mentioned earlier in my comments we have seen greater demand from our OEM based starting in Q1 versus Q4. We have not seen any less participation even on the export side on these highly engineered products, greater demand for that product even though the value of the dollar is high."
Ed Marshall,Michael Siegal,"So, my focus is going to be on the CTI you’ve had it now for six months. It looks like the quarter would have had a reported loss without it in the core business, which I guess is not unusual for your fourth quarter seasonality in the flat roll. But that obviously supports why you went after this particular business but now you’ve had it for six months I mean how do you see this shaping up, do you even find if it’s performing better than you thought it would. You know it’s kind of can you add some additional comments surrounding that CTI acquisition?","Well, let me comment first at and maybe David wants to comment afterwards. But yes it is performing every bit to our expectation and I think as David indicated this was an exceedingly well managed organization that restore profitability I think the combinations as David talked about of our integration teams introducing one CTI to Olympic customers and vice versa Olympic customers to CTI has been very well received. I think as we look at placing inventories in locations we have some real costs, opportunities to eliminate some freight factors as we go forward. So both from a growth standpoint and a cost reduction standpoint I think it is actually operating better than we would have anticipated."

You know it’s kind of can you add some additional comments surrounding that CTI acquisition?","Hi Ed, David here. Just echoing what Michael said we were fortunate enough to be able to acquire Chicago Tube and Iron and our view of this was it was a company that had economies of excellence unquoted. So when you have a highest of expectations you are rarely surprised or disappointed and CTI’s case led by Don McNeeley we were surprised how strong this company has allowed us to further penetrate a marketplace. So what’s unique about this uniting of these two companies and the acquisition of CT&amp;I is that we didn’t justify that purchase with any synergies to our board. There were no synergies we thought that company was so well run that they were going to be and they are a great business partner for Olympic Steel. What we thought afterwards was that we would put a commercial integration team together, which we did and we thought that we could prosper exponentially by investing in equipment as Michael outlined and also in penetrating new marketplaces and we have been pleasantly surprised to the welcome that has been put out there for us and the success that we’ve seen. So it is every bit and more than we had anticipated."
Ed Marshall,David Wolfort,"What kind of synergies if I may have you identified in that acquisition again you’ve seen it for six months. And when you speak of synergies are you talking about revenue synergies because of you know cross selling of the product lines or you are talking more and you did mention cost synergies, so I’m assuming there is some of those as well.","Well number one Ed you are 100% right and that is revenue synergies and the combined entities even though we only have half the year of their sales in our 2011 success. We see in excess of $100 million of new businesses over a time period it’s just a matter of how much, how fast we can absorb this new participation. Secondly on a cost basis we in many cases were selling some of the same large OEMs and we are able to reallocate some of our resources in terms of inventory and capture some freight savings and then free up some space in some facilities for more opportunities of growth."
Ed Marshall,Michael Siegal,If I may can you quantify some of the costs or I’m sensing that you don’t want to do that at this time.,"No, we do not."
Ed Marshall,David Wolfort,And then you mentioned some discussion on volume for 2012 and what you thought for pricing as well. Would you talk about the order of magnitude for both I mean demand is going to be up you are seeing some pricing pressures but could you kind of give us any kind of sense of direction of what you mix?,"Well let me just speak to the demand side of the equation because I mentioned that earlier Ed and we’ve seen continued growth. We had strong growth as Rick and Mike and I outlined for your throughout the year and we see further growth in ’12. Remember that the biggest part of our capital expenditures beyond, which was $39 million was our third temper mill and as I remarked, as I remarked earlier it’s coming on quicker than the two previous temper mills its cash flow neutral and it has an annualized capacity at full strength of 150,000 tons. We won’t achieve the 150,000 tons in ’12 but we will achieve a significant part of that growth because we are already at cash flow neutral and the tonnage moving through there is growing on a daily basis and the success rate is terrific. The rest of the investments on downstream our second facilities to some areas where we have some terrific growth and we’ve outlined that in previous quarters Mount Sterling, Kentucky; Moses Lake, Washington are all big successes all profitable and we are serving businesses that are continuing to recover at double digit rates off of the recession of late ’08 and ’09."
Ed Marshall,David Wolfort,"So if I can sum up with I think you are saying about the Gary facility that’s underutilized right now as you are starting to fill out the capacity shipping capacity around. I get the sense that operating expense that you incurred to startup the cost of yields incurred in the fourth quarter and will continue to incur say through the first, through 2012 will minimize as you start to fill out that capacity. Do you assume by the end of the year you will be close to a run rate capacity of coming close to filling that or there you are going to see still some decrement there?","No, I think you are right. I think we will continue to push as fast as we can but I would again as coming up faster and the short answer is yes we will see it at it’s reasonable capacity certainly towards the end of the year incrementally growing quarter-over-quarter."

Do you assume by the end of the year you will be close to a run rate capacity of coming close to filling that or there you are going to see still some decrement there?","The other aspect of it is it’s got a people issue here too. So obviously when you start facility bring out one shift you don’t bring out a second shift. So, some of this does require a certain amount of training."

Do you assume by the end of the year you will be close to a run rate capacity of coming close to filling that or there you are going to see still some decrement there?",So as David indicated we’ve seen a very fast ramp well faster than the other two temper mills. We are now beginning to prepare to start the training for second shift already into the second quarter. So we will run two full shifts by you know the third quarter we will be thrilled.
Sandeep SM,Michael Siegal,"We have recently seen some shift by the E&amp;D companies from oil, natural gas to oil side. Can you just give a mix of CTI what kind of exposure do you have for each of these sectors.",They really don’t have a bigger exposure to the OCTG market at all. I would state nothing but it’s really demonisms to their overall performance. We would be looking at Sandeep as we move forward and look at the growth opportunities with CTI in a scenario of exploration but it’s really is not impacting the development.
Sandeep SM,David Wolfort,"So, what kind of growth did you see in that sector in 2012 and for CTI?","Well Sandeep CTI has been an steady player in the marketplace we see a fairly significant amount of growth. But as I related just a moment ago a lot of those synergies come from our efforts our commercial efforts to remove some of the product from their existing nine warehouses and put some of that product in our existing 20 some, 26 warehouses and then picking up the opportunity to grow that market share. Quite frankly, Chicago Tube and Iron has fulfilled most of their facilities. We have a brand new laser coming on stream in the (Inaudible) laser, which is a big capital expenditure and we hope to, hope we will expand that market penetration in the existing markets that we are in now. Without putting too much pressure on them as listening to this we certainly would anticipate at least 10% growth on the CTI side of the equation."
Sandeep SM,David Wolfort,"Okay, thanks. And the next question is what is your expectations regarding inboard. You’ve seen the U.S. prices come off a bit and you have seen global prices it depends on where you look at. But Europe at least has mode of return do you expect inboards to keep coming in for next couple of months or do you expect that to slow down in the coming months?","No Sandeep, I think you written about it I think most have commented on it. There is the highest price the steel marketplaces here in the U.S. the dollar is strong other currencies obviously are weaker and so we see more imports now and more offers now than we saw last year. Well the concern would be for the buyer whether he can absorb or she can absorb the vagaries of the transportation and the vagaries of the marketplace. Right now, we do see more offerings than we saw last year but quite frankly there is more demand too."
Sandeep SM,David Wolfort,"Okay and if I could ask one more question when I think about your I mean the flat product side, can we expect another double digit volume growth in 2012 or do you think that it will maybe delayed a bit?","Well I will tell you that’s strong but we are gearing towards that. And I don’t want to specifically give you away percentage of growth in flat roll that we are going to have in 2012 but I would tell you as I commented earlier 2011 saw a growth of 16% and 2012 is stronger than ’11. So we are moving in a very positive direction and of course we’re bringing Gary on along with other facilities as we’ve answered previous questions. So you’ve got a significant amount of more, significantly more tonnage moving through our facilities. So, without getting specific on percentages a very close view to what’s your insinuative."
Sandeep SM,Michael Siegal,"Okay and if I could ask one more question when I think about your I mean the flat product side, can we expect another double digit volume growth in 2012 or do you think that it will maybe delayed a bit?","Sandeep, we got lot of new capacity that we didn’t have we it was our expectation that it will run very strong."
Aldo Mazzaferro,Michael Siegal,"Good, we are going to look specifically at the temper mill and try to the Gary temper mill and try to gauge the market demand there. What sectors we should be mostly looking at that specific piece of equipment.","Certain sectors we always serve Aldo I mean this was a capacity gain for us literally in servicing our customers and our customers actually asking us to do more we really were constrained without doing outsourcing on our temper mill capacity. So I would say we are servicing the agricultural the mining industries and obviously the heavy machinery industries. There is no new market for this, this is just meeting the customer demand that we have that we couldn’t fulfill with internal processes."
Aldo Mazzaferro,David Wolfort,"I see, so a separate question on the you guys quantified your startup cost and I’m wondering David you had mentioned earlier that there was also some penalties you incurred in entering new markets, which I would assume on the top line is that, that’s not included in those startup costs I would assume. It’s not can you give us a feeling of what magnitude those might have been.","Well Aldo those are my remarks are commercial remarks that’s the compression on the March and then we saw in some of these new geographies there. As you would expect competitors to protect their, protect return. And so as we penetrated some of these new marketplaces our traditional mark up was under a little bit of pressure first is our normal established marketplace where we are a known entity. We can quantify it."
Aldo Mazzaferro,David Wolfort,"Right, right. Okay. Just one more I had one, could you describe a little more about what exactly you are doing in Mexico in terms of customers down there in processes and services that you are putting out?","Well I can Aldo first of all we went down with one of our good customers from the Midwest and we are sharing a facility with that good customers and again as Michael indicated related to the temper mill the same applies to our Monterrey, Mexico facility. We are literally catering to the same customers that we are catering to in North America although they have a Mexican presence and we are giving them that opportunity to avail themselves of just in time delivery and lean manufacturing. And we are servicing on them in the same way as we do up north so very easy for us to migrate down there with one of our strong customers."
Aldo Mazzaferro,David Wolfort,"Great, can you say what sector that customer is in machinery again?","Yes, construction equipment and mining equipment."
Tim Hayes,Michael Siegal,Two questions on your contract business that historically was 60% going about two thirds. Just what is the average line to reset pricing on those contracts?,Yeah a month to three months.
Tim Hayes,David Wolfort,"Okay and then any status update on the option about the fourth, putting the fourth temper mill in the Southeast.","The answer is that, the answer is we have to absorb what we’ve undertaken. I would tell you we obviously have a very significant amount of capital investment and we will irrespective of the fourth temper mill. Obviously we would like to see some of the suggestion and profitability come to us from the investments. Like the fourth temper mill is under act of exploration but there is nothing to announce."
Jason Brocious,Rick Marabito,I was just wondering the 29.9 gross margins you gave for CTI does that include the inventory mark up impact.,Yeah.
Jason Brocious,David Wolfort,Okay and you guys had talked in the past that OCTG might be a viable strategy for CTI in the future. I mean is that something you are still looking into.,Yes.
Jason Brocious,Michael Siegal,What would the timeframe be on that and what would be involved in switching from the commercial boiler stuff to the CTI focus to an OCTG focus.,Well I don’t know if we would lose the one focus or the other but let’s just say from an add to perspective adjacent OCTG is a difficult market to enter without the inquisitive so I would just tell you that that’s obviously commented the acquisition marketplace is looking outside after being robust.
Jason Brocious,David Wolfort,What would the timeframe be on that and what would be involved in switching from the commercial boiler stuff to the CTI focus to an OCTG focus.,And Jason let me add that we are very happy with Chicago Tube and Iron’s current business and their business model. So we wouldn’t switch any of that though it all be accretive as Michael just indicated.
Jason Brocious,Michael Siegal,"Okay, alright. And I know that going after the large OEMs been a focus over the last few years. I mean as there a percentage of sales that you could give us as far as what the big guys like Caterpillar make up today versus four or five years ago?","Yeah, you know there is no small contracts shall we say so. We’ve migrated almost two thirds of the business to contractor it’s pretty much also you wanted to customers."
