Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"This is Brian Peterson for Brian Alexander. Guys, just to start on demand, I know last call you said on the March quarter you saw some increased activity. Did that actually flow through or is some of that still out there? I am just trying to get some greater color on the stabilization that we are seeing.","The increased activity flowed through and it resulted in sequential increase and performance both on a sales per day basis, sales per ship data as well as sales per month basis throughout the quarter."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,How is that trending in April thus far?,"At this point, we have seen stability. We do not see any further improvement but we do not see any further deterioration."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,Okay. If I look at the MME margins and I know the services mix is driving a lot of your expansion there. Where do you see that ultimately settling as far as a service mix as a percentage of MME revenues?,"Well, Brian, it is very hard to answer that question because we do not manage the business to a particular mix and whereas we are happy about the increase in margin or unhappy that part of that increase comes from a reduction in product revenue sales which are lower margin than services. So, I will be the happiest guy if our margin actually decreases because hopefully that will mean that our product revenue is rebounding in the MME business."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"Right. Okay, I know you guys mentioned the $1.7 million you expect from the savings. Can you guys maybe break out any timing of those savings or no?","Yes, we can and we expect that roughly half of those savings will come in the second quarter and the remaining half will come slight over the third and the fourth quarter of this year."
Brian Peterson,Frank Khulusi,"Okay, great. Just lastly, how are you guys looking at capital deployment? I know you guys bought back some shares this quarter. Is that going to continue to be a priority maybe M&A or are looking to store cash? Thanks.","We constantly evaluate between all the various tools that we have to increase shareholder value whether what the best use of capital is. So, we really cannot comment on exactly what our thought process is. Today, we continued to be opportunistic and we continued to look at acquisitions as well as we continue to have a desire to buyback stock, where that actually ends up, I cannot tell you."
Matt Sheerin,Frank Khulusi,"Just following up on the question regarding demand, sounds like things have stabilized not getting much better. Historically, it looks like the June quarter is about flattish sequentially for you seasonally. Is that sort of how you are seeing it now? Do you think that maybe there is some pent-up demand as Kris pointed out? Some budgets are opening up, but are there some customers out there, Kris or Frank, that sort of are putting things on hold to see how their businesses play out?","Absolutely, there are customers that are still putting things on hold. There are customers that have opened up. So, it is kind of you win some, you lose some and it is really coming in every day and fighting in the trenches, working on a client customers and retaining customers, but we do very well with that and with chaos comes opportunity. So, I am very optimistic about the future. With respect to the short term future, however, it is hard to forecast. The best thing I can do right now is tell you based on what we note today. We think it is going to be flattish from Q1 to Q2, but again, much of the quarter remains in front of us. So, I would say, Matt, that we are not looking, we are currently not anticipating a significant bump if any bump at all from the first and the second quarter."
Matt Sheerin,Frank Khulusi,"Okay. And to your point Frank about sort of fighting in the trenches, are you finding market share opportunities against whether it would be smaller VARs or other direct resellers because of whether they are credit issues or service issues? Are you starting to see larger customers for instance change their buying habits at all?","Yes, we are finding larger customers and all customers, a lot of customers I should say from all market segments, change their buying habits based on a multitude of reasons, some of which are what you are articulated with respect to the current suppliers. But others and most of those reasons have to do with their own individual reasons and their concern for the economy."
Matt Sheerin,Frank Khulusi,Okay. And then the services business holding up very well. Is that partly because you are continuing to grow that and take share or is that also a priority for customers whether it would be outsourcing or continuing to need that service?,"We believe that we are continuing to take share. We are executing quite a bit of other people out there in the market, as well as the customers themselves especially in this tough environment who view our value added services as more interesting than ever and so we are very excited about that business and as Kris mentioned earlier, in the scripted portion of this call that we continued to invest both on an organic basis to drive organic growth and build capability and functionality that we do not have as well as to add the functionality that we do have and also look for acquisitions that complement us in that area."
Matt Sheerin,Frank Khulusi,"Okay. And just lastly, as you look to return to growth whether it would be in a couple of quarters from now or next year, the operating leverage in the model sounds like some of the enterprise business comes back that could hinder gross margin but you should get some very strong leverage on your SG&A as you lower costs here, correct?","Absolutely. I mean if you look at our headcount alone I mean it did not go down on the sales side commensurate with the decrease in sales so that clearly indicates an investment from a headcount perspective relative what it could have been. We are also investing quite a bit on the IT side, quick mention by example the new MacMall site. But this is a very small example of what is a concerted effort that includes everything from our phone systems, our infrastructure to many, many other facets of what we do. So, we are really using this opportunity to kind of full back a little bit and build for the future and we are very excited about when the market actually does come back. We think we are going to be in a very strong position."
Chris Krueger,Frank Khulusi,"At some point, okay. What was the CapEx in the quarter?",We do not work towards an increase in gross margin. We work towards an increase in gross profit and an increase in operating profit.
Chris Krueger,Frank Khulusi,"Alright. Last question, just more qualitative, just in general when you just look out to the next three to six months, do you feel better about the situation than you did three or four months ago of looking on this in the future?",Absolutely. I mean January was pretty scary but the one thing that kept us stay and it was the fact that our customers were saying that they just did not have their budget approved yet. It is not like they were not going to spend and then as things have corrected at least now we can count on a certain run rate business. I mean we do not know what we do not know but we are much more relaxed than we were in at the start of this year.
Chris Krueger,Frank Khulusi,"Alright, and last question, on public spending, is there any thoughts on the stimulus package that we are spending and if there is any potential for benefit there or any comments you are hearing from those types of customers for the next remainder of the year?","We are probably as good as any other economies out there. No, we are not, as far as predicting what the effectiveness of the stimulus packages. I was joking. We do not know. We really do not know. We are hopeful that I mean there is a lot of money being pumped in the system and the economy. So, at some point that should help and that should mean something but that really remains to be seen. We have not started feeling the impact of that. We do not believe that the sequential increase that we experienced in the first quarter have much to do with any increase spending. We think it has to do with a little of I would not say return to sanity but more civilization in the credit markets a little bit and also the fact that the companies have to open up of their spend at some point. The beauty of our business is that companies can defer and can defer, but at some point they are going to have to spend and when they spend a lot of what they have deferred they are going to have to catch up. It is not like they are saving. Some of them are saving especially if they lay off people but others they are going to have to really catch up with some money that they have deferred. So, again, well, we are just like you, to a large extent, spectators. All we can do is prepare and be ready and have faith. I have great faith in this country and I know we will return with a vengeance and we will be there. We will ready to take advantage of it."
Bill Dawkins,Kristin Rogers,"Great work and for a long, long time you guys are operating this thing better than ever I have ever seen you. Since the other question has been asked, one general question with respect to Windows 7 and I do not know how much talk you will have with your customers and stuff like that in particular in respect to maybe a pent-up demand issue. But are any of your customers talking about Windows 7 and the release of that and anything that would be wrapped around that?","It is Kris. Candidly no, I think that there is and actually to be really candid. The only people I have ever talked to that I have ever talked about Windows 7 are the OEMs and so, yes, it might come up in the conversation with HP or someone else but it is not coming up in the corporate environment. I do not think there is any pent-up demand with respect to the release and so it is not having any affect on our business whatsoever. I wish it. I wish I could tell you that there is a pent-up in demand but there is really not."
