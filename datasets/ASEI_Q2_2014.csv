Stephen E. Levenson,Kenneth J. Galaznik,I was just going to ask a little bit more about the BOT outlook in the leasing and how that might impact your cash balance. How much cash do you think you'll have to use there? Will it impede in any way the dividend or buyback programs?,"Steve, at this point, I don't think -- I don't see anything impacting the repurchase or the dividend program related to those activities. As you know, with the balance we're carrying, we have adequate room to pick up that type of a leasing program or investment in a BOT."
Stephen E. Levenson,Charles P. Dougherty,I was just going to ask a little bit more about the BOT outlook in the leasing and how that might impact your cash balance. How much cash do you think you'll have to use there? Will it impede in any way the dividend or buyback programs?,"And, Steve, we've -- Ken and the team have established, I think, a well-defined business model for these types of activities that aligns with our current business model and in terms of a risk profile, financial profile that I think certainly supports what Ken just conveyed."
Stephen E. Levenson,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay, sounds good. And last, could you breakdown the backlog between domestic and international, please?","We don't typically break that down, Steve. But based on the current activities domestically, you can guesstimate which way that's going. The activities to date are international, as Jeff pointed out. So I look forward to continue to grow on that area."
Stephen E. Levenson,Kenneth J. Galaznik,Okay. So would it be fair to say heavily weighted towards international right now?,"It's weighted that way, yes, sir."
Josephine Lin Millward ,Charles P. Dougherty,So you booked 20 ZBVs during the quarter. How many did you ship?,9
Josephine Lin Millward ,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And I missed your service revenue. If you don't -- if you wouldn't mind repeating that again, Ken.","Absolutely. Let's see if I can get back to where I was here, $24.3 million, Josephine."
Josephine Lin Millward ,Charles P. Dougherty,"Okay. So since we're pulling out of Afghanistan next year, can you talk about where you see your DoD service revenue going in 2015?","Josephine, it becomes -- it really remains a difficult challenge from the standpoint of -- if I go back in time 5 or 6 years ago, we were having these conversations and where we thought it was going to go to. And how it's being handled now coming out and the interest in the people remaining in theater [ph]-- non-DoD that are interested in services, interested in product and this type of thing, very difficult to say where it's going. I'm confident -- I feel good about what I see being discussed, and we'll see if that moves forward in the fashion they're talking about right now."
Josephine Lin Millward ,Charles P. Dougherty,"Great. One last question. Given the success you've had with the CBP, can you give us an update on immigration reform and whether you see this might be a key opportunity for you in the coming year?","I'll comment on that. We still do, subject to, obviously, the political wins. But we still are fairly optimistic that this would -- can be a catalyst for the business in the next couple years, subject to, obviously, passing through Congress. But everything that we understand is that there's still a heavy emphasis on heightened border security as a requirement for passing immigration reform. And with that, we would expect that to be a reasonable catalyst for our business."
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"So my first question was on -- I thought this was the first quarter that we'd see some reduced services revenue as the Marine contracts started to get layered out. But yes, it was up pretty nicely. Was I incorrect in my timing, or was something else happened there? Or can you help me out?","I think it's the phasing out of that and some other opportunities that they present themselves, yes, that we were able to stay in a strong position this quarter, yes."
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"I mean, is that -- what you're saying, you should expect going forward, or I mean, it was -- or are you saying that you just kind of wound up on a -- you closed up a few loose ends and there was additional revenue in the quarter that won't repeat itself going forward?","At this point, I would be in that latter camp, that there were some opportunities that presented themselves that I don't know if it'll be in the go-forward numbers or not. But I mean, I look for a change in the number."
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And then -- I'm not asking for guidance, but there was 18 ZBV in the last week of September. So as I look forward -- I mean, typically that's a better-margin business for you, so should I think about third quarter gross margins being pretty healthy based on kind of just timing of those ZBV?","I think if those vans were to ship in the quarter, it actually will be a contributor. But keep in mind, it's the overall, what the other product lines are doing. And as you know, product mix is very important to our composite gross margin."
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Sure. And then as I look at the $0.5 million of sequential SG&A take-out, and I'm looking first quarter to second quarter, was there something that -- I didn't realize, did you trim some costs in the quarter? I mean, I know you added some headcount with some leadership, et cetera. But -- or was there something onetime that might have been in those numbers? I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for SG&A as we look forward.","We had some charges in the first quarter, more legal related, that we did not repeat in the second quarter. As I sit here right now, I can't think of anything else significant that would -- that'd be driving that."
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And if I think about ZBVs as you're shipping to municipalities, I'm wondering what the -- how that pricing may be different than, say, to government. Are you seeing a trim on your pricing? Are you seeing a little bit better pricing? How's the competitive scale there, et cetera?","To date, I'm not seeing anything [indiscernible] point. Keep in mind, those are GSA price list, so that provides a nice floor from my perspective."
Edward Marshall,Charles P. Dougherty,"Okay. And if I think about ZBVs as you're shipping to municipalities, I'm wondering what the -- how that pricing may be different than, say, to government. Are you seeing a trim on your pricing? Are you seeing a little bit better pricing? How's the competitive scale there, et cetera?","Yes. I think what we're seeing are pretty comparable, Ed."
Edward Marshall,Charles P. Dougherty,"Pretty comparable from, say, the DoD type?","From our norms, yes.
"
Edward Marshall,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And then if I look at the cash deployment, there's about, what, $20, $21.50 of cash in the balance sheet. And I know you've been repurchasing shares, and you have a nice generous dividend policy. But as I kind of look at repurchasing as we go forward, in your thought process, I mean, are you guys concerned at all about the float that's outstanding and the availability of shares? And kind of -- are you going to continue to buy in to that or buy back stock into that if the opportunity presents itself? Or have you considered other cash deployment options?
","Well, I think -- obviously, we do -- we are aware of the float issue and the conversation there and balancing that impact, but we do have a matrix in place that establishes what amount we purchase at which price levels from that standpoint. It's been a challenge for several years. It's a great challenge to have. But I mean, there's only so many places we can go with the cash. As Chuck said earlier, we remain strongly interested in inorganic activity. And with the BOT conversation and the leasing conversation, it's nice to have the cash available if those opportunities truly make sense for us to get involved in.

Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"A couple of follow-on questions. First of all, bookings in the quarter, what was the exact number?
","$45.7 million.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"How much, $35.7 million?
","45. Don't forget that one point forward [ph], Brian.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. So there's been several questions on this, and I'll ask it from a different angle. When will you start seeing the drop from the DoD? It appears that you're running at record levels on the services side? And if you could -- do you expect, first of all, to see a drop?
","Brian, as I said, we're now functioning under the Army contract, if you will. We are functioning as a sub to a prime, and I commented that we'll be at a reduced level. And that contract is in effect as we speak now, so we'll see that roll out over the next quarters.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. So the Marine contract was already in this, is that correct, or the marine contract has not started yet, rolling off?","Correct, correct."
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,Okay. So correct it's not started rolling off yet?,"No, it's done."
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And when exactly did the Marine contract, as you as the prime, start and then the Army contract? What month?
","Brian, of top off head, I'm -- I want to say it was August, that timeframe.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"August for Army?
","Yes. August for Marine.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"August for Marine. And Army was?
","Army has been renewed, and it continue to go on. I want to say that, don't quote me on this, off the top of my head, it was this early September conversation.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Charles P. Dougherty,"Okay. But going forward, it's renewed for what, 1 month, 2 months? How long?
","1 year.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. But going forward, it's renewed for what, 1 month, 2 months? How long?
","It's a year, Brian.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Great, okay. And then the margins in the quarter for services were what?
","50% off the top of my head.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And you think that you can maintain those levels going forward?
","Those are strong. Those remain strong from that standpoint. And as you know, it's going to depend on what it takes to service the fixed price contracts that we're under.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. And DSOs were year lows. Do you expect that -- DSOs at those level are -- or where we see with something because the DoD changes, that you had low DSOs in the quarter?
","Nothing to do with DoD, off top of my head, Brian, but it's more a function of the revenue -- some of the -- pretty good part of the revenue was related to contracts that we've received deposits on. So you get a lift on your DSO relating to those.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay. So we should see DSOs higher moving forward?
","I would definitely think so, yes, sir.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Kenneth J. Galaznik,"Okay, great. And then final question on BOT. Would leasing be part of this whole BOT, or is this -- we're talking about apples and oranges, you're just looking at different business models, one's leasing and one's BOT, right?
","I see it as separate models. It's vague. There's people argue, it's part of the BOT model. But I see it as an expansion of that, if you will. Leasing is going to be more fixed payment-driven as opposed to tied to performance at the site. So in my world, I would see this slightly different but the same general idea.
"
Brian W. Ruttenbur,Charles P. Dougherty,"Okay. And then final question for Chuck. On the BOT, do you expect something in the next 12 months, or when? Is there something on the horizon that you can point to?
","I mean, there are certainly, Brian, things on the horizon. And as I said, kind of the expectation for success, I would -- I think it's realistic to expect to win in that timeframe.
