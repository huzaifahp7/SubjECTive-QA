John Janedis,Gracia C. Martore,"Two questions for you. Just first, did your businesses see any impact from the government shutdown, meaning exiting 3Q or 4Q to date?","I can say that there's been direct impact, and then there's probably the more indirect impact. For instance, we have a little business called Gannett Government Media. Obviously, that had a pretty chilling effect on that business. We own a television station here in Washington D.C. As you can appreciate, it serves the Northern Virginia, D.C. and Maryland areas. And those, I believe, were the states most impacted directly by the slowdown. As for a more global impact across our company, I've read a lot of pundits who have indicated that this is going to have some meaningful impact on the economy over the next period of time. We'll just going to see how that plays out. I think the important thing is going to be whether we just simply kick the can down the road and, therefore, we start up with the uncertainty again that causes businesses and consumers to be a bit chilled by what they see going on here in Washington D.C., or whether this can be a much more collaborative outcome that this company -- country I believe so richly deserves. That was my political thought for this morning.",,,
John Janedis,Gracia C. Martore,"Separately, can you talk about the circulation revenue trends you're seeing at USCP? Did you see any change in retention rates as subscribers anniversary the original increases? Any differences depending on the market size? And given the increased content you're delivering, is another price increase coming in the near term?","Let me start. I have Bob Dickey here, and I think, Bob, you can give us a little bit of color on retention, which I think is a good story.",,,
John Janedis,Robert J. Dickey,"Separately, can you talk about the circulation revenue trends you're seeing at USCP? Did you see any change in retention rates as subscribers anniversary the original increases? Any differences depending on the market size? And given the increased content you're delivering, is another price increase coming in the near term?","Retention right now, John, has improved just slightly overall. We're pretty flat with a year ago after some increases early in the program. So we're very happy with that. Our subscribers continue to be incredibly loyal. As it relates to price increases, at this point in time, we have not announced any. We are doing some very selective price increases as part of the previous full access model in some markets where [indiscernible] deeper discounted subscribers up the ladder, and those are going as planned. That's where we are at this point",,,
John Janedis,Gracia C. Martore,"Separately, can you talk about the circulation revenue trends you're seeing at USCP? Did you see any change in retention rates as subscribers anniversary the original increases? Any differences depending on the market size? And given the increased content you're delivering, is another price increase coming in the near term?","Yes, I think, John, with respect to pricing, the very foundation of what we did with our all-access content subscription model and now with what we're doing with these 4 pilots is to be totally focused on enhancing our content for readers and users. And we believe that when we provide additional value as we have with our all-access content model as we are doing with relaunches of our mobile sites and apps and a variety of other things and, for instance, in these 4 pilot markets where we are providing literally 70 or 80 additional pages of both national and local content that consumers are finding valuable and we're hearing from them the value they see in it, that we believe that will potentially give us the leverage -- some pricing leverage. But it's still unbelievably early. We're only a couple of weeks into it. I think we can probably speak more concretely about it when we get to the investor conference in early December. But we feel optimistic about our focus on content and bringing additional value to consumers. We've already proven that by doing that once. Consumers were willing to give us pricing leverage, and we believe that we can repeat that as long as we continue to provide that added content and value.",,,
John Janedis,Gracia C. Martore,"Okay. Gracia, sorry, 1 -- 2 quick model questions. One, does the TV station segment, that pacing [ph] number, if you will, does that adjust for the Captivate deconsolidation from last year? And secondly, on the circulation side, is flattish year-over-year x the extra week how you're thinking about the quarter?","our first question is whether the television guidance we gave you is really -- includes Captivate, and it doesn't. That's a pure television-to-television comparison. So that 10% to 12% increase excluding political is a 19% decrease excluding the extra week from last year, is purely a television-to-television comparison. And I'm sorry, your -- the second part of that question, John?",,,
John Janedis,Gracia C. Martore,"Just on the circulation side. Given the flattening out of the growth, x the extra week from last year, does 4Q kind of look like 3Q?","Yes, I mean I think it will be probably within that range. We've got a couple of pieces going on here. Number one, we've got Newsquest, who will continue to benefit from some of the pricing that they've done as well at USA TODAY. They instituted some pricing actions on home delivery in July and on single copy at the beginning -- at the very end of September. So we'll have some benefit from those 2 pieces. But then we will have further cycled all of the ramp out of the all-access content subscription model. But I think we're looking at this more than just from a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think as we look into 2014 and we see how these pilots go that we've done in these 4 communities, I think that, that potentially gives us an opportunity that will be much more meaningful than what we're talking about right now.",,,
Douglas M. Arthur,Gracia C. Martore,"Yes, Gracia, a couple of questions on TV and one quick one on all-access. The extra week impact to the newspapers for Q4 is pretty well chronicled. Can you just remind us on TV? The extra week is, I believe, is not quite as significant as a revenue factor for last year. Can you kind of box what that is? Secondly, on TV, I believe you're coming into some pretty important or at least one important retrans negotiation in the fourth quarter. I know you're loathe to talk about that, but any guidance there as to timing and potential impact would be helpful. And then Victoria, you talked all year about the $100 million pretax cumulative benefit from all-access. Are you still on target there to the bottom line, or are you actually ahead?","Well, that's 3 questions, so I'll take the first 2, and then I'll pop the last one over to Victoria. With respect to the 53rd week on television, you're exactly right. The impact was probably in about the $10 million range on total revenues last year for the extra week. And then with respect to -- and for the total company, it was about I think around $60 million and about $0.03 of EPS to frame that extra, extra week when you go back and look at our press release from the fourth quarter of last year. With respect to retrans, we -- as Dave Lougee, who is here with me as well, and I have indicated, we do have one significant deal and one more modest deal coming due, but towards the very end of the quarter, so we don't anticipate anything of consequence in terms of the impact on the fourth quarter. Obviously, we'll have to see how those negotiations go, and then we will be able to give you, once they're completed, some better estimates for our retrans for 2014. But we should see retrans in an absolute basis being roughly comparable to what we posted in the third quarter. And as you recall on the fourth quarter of last year, we had some meaningful transactions that also boosted revenue in the fourth quarter. More likely these will boost revenue in the first quarter and beyond.",,,
Douglas M. Arthur,Victoria Dux Harker,And then the $100 million target?,"On your all-access question, and I won't speak for Bob, obviously, but I think at this point, given the fact that we had already generated about $20 million of the bottom line impact even prior to going into this year, we're on a good trajectory relative to this year's year-to-date, I think, we're at this point, very comfortable with the $100 million bottom line impact.",,,
Craig Huber,Gracia C. Martore,"I've got some housekeeping questions. I've got 2 to start off with, please. What's the update of your circulation digital-only subscriptions in the quarter? I believe it was 65,000 into the second quarter. And also Gracia, what was the daily and Sunday circulation volume percent change in the quarter for U.S. Community Publishing? And I have some follow-ups.","Sure. Let me start with the second question, which is with respect to daily volume at U.S. Community Publishing. In the third quarter, down about 7%. That's actually better than the second quarter, which was down around 8%. And then on the Sunday, down about 11%, which is again a bit better than the second quarter, which was down a little over 12%. With respect to the metrics around our all-access content subscription model, the one that I think -- in addition -- well, there are several metrics we pay a lot of attention to. Victoria just articulated one of the most important, which is the fact that we said we were going to add about $100 million to operating profitability, and we are absolutely on course to do that, if not slightly better than that. That's one of the most important metrics. I think the second metric is that we had said at the get go that we expected ultimately to get to about 60% activation of the digital subscriptions that we were providing as part of our all-access content subscription model. At this point, Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're at about 53% comp -- against all of those units, but we have probably a dozen places where they're above 70% or 65% or 70%. So we feel very good about being well on track with the digital traction that we expected to achieve out of this initiative. We're at about 1,500,000 digital subscribers who have activated their -- all-access subscribers who have activated their digital part of their subscription. One of the smallest metrics is with respect to digital-only for 2 reasons. One is that we have spent a heck of a lot more time focused on digital-only plus Sunday. And we've seen about 10% or so of the digital-only subscribers quickly become digital-only plus Sunday. And frankly that is an incredibly valuable subscriber to us because, as you well know from following us as long as you have, Craig, that Sunday is such an important day for advertising and to have additional Sunday exposure is incredibly important to us. We have also -- that number is probably in excess of 75,000 or 80,000 at the moment, but frankly that's probably one of the least significant and important metrics that we have used to determine the success of what has been just an extremely successful initiative for the company.",,,
Craig Huber,Gracia C. Martore,"So Gracia, just to be clear, are you ballparking at 75,000 to 80,000 plus any digital-only subs that switched over to digital plus Sunday print? Is that what you're saying?","If you're just specifically looking at that one small metric, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. But I think the more important metric is 1.5 million paying digital access subscribers as part of our all-access content model who have activated their subscriptions.",,,
Craig Huber,Victoria Dux Harker,"And then a couple -- a few more housekeeping questions, please. On the cost front in newsprint, what was the average percent change in price year-over-year in consumption? And then also I'm curious, for your Digital segment, Gracia, the up 5% or so revenues, what was that number excluding the small acquisitions, please?","This is Victoria. On the newsprint price for the quarter, it was down just pretty small. It was about 0.4% decrease. The usage was down about 8.6%. So expense overall, down about 9%. That's roughly in line with what year-to-date -- it's slightly higher in total for year-to-date but it's about the same ratio.",,,
Craig Huber,Gracia C. Martore,"And then a couple -- a few more housekeeping questions, please. On the cost front in newsprint, what was the average percent change in price year-over-year in consumption? And then also I'm curious, for your Digital segment, Gracia, the up 5% or so revenues, what was that number excluding the small acquisitions, please?","And I assume on the 5%, you're referring to our Digital segment. And really I think we've lapped most of the acquisition. So if they had any impact, it would have been very nominal.",,,
Craig Huber,Gracia C. Martore,"Then my last question, Gracia, for that U.S. TODAY content that you put in these 4 pilot markets, I mean, you've said 70 pages in total across a week. I'm curious, does that include extra ad revenue in there as well? Or that can't be all just editorial, I assume, right?","First of all, those 70 pages include both USA TODAY content, as well as additional local content. A lot of it is content, but there is some advertising. So for instance, for a USA TODAY advertiser now has an opportunity to be across a wider swath of consumers by being in that section. So obviously there is going to be some advertising content as well as a great deal more of editorial content as well.",,,
Alexia S. Quadrani,Gracia C. Martore,"Just following up on USA TODAY, could you give us a little color, I guess, what the strategy is there in terms of this migration of -- with the hotels to more digital product versus the print product? I guess, any color you can give us on how that impacts your profitability or really how you monetize that move.","Sure. I think all of us who travel and all of us who stay in hotels understand that more and more consumers, when they're in hotels, are armed with smartphones or tablets or whatever devices, in addition to receiving the USA TODAY at their doorstep. And what we believe is that we need to be at the forefront of however consumers want to activate and access our content. And so as more consumers and hotels want to consume that content on their devices, we want to be there, and we want to follow those consumers. And so we've effectively done that in the Hilton situation. Now, as I've said before, those opportunities that we have in the Hilton Hotel rooms, which I think are in excess of 3,000 or 4,000 hotel rooms now, is not going to be in your circulation revenue, but we are paid to provide that portal and those -- some of those additional features of content. And then I think also what it helps us is that it's a pretty targeted audience, and we can show to advertisers and others that these folks are travelers and have certain demographics because they're in certain part of the Hilton Diamond members or whatever. So I think it's a combination of advertising, together with being paid to provide that portal service. And frankly, it costs us less to provide that content, where there's no ink and paper and distribution costs involved.",,,
Alexia S. Quadrani,Victoria Dux Harker,"Just following up on USA TODAY, could you give us a little color, I guess, what the strategy is there in terms of this migration of -- with the hotels to more digital product versus the print product? I guess, any color you can give us on how that impacts your profitability or really how you monetize that move.","And just -- this is Victoria, just to expand on that a little bit, we're looking also now the next set of opportunities past Hilton to take a similar kind of approach with other hotel chains that allow a similar type of a portal access that we have the ability to charge for, and again, give -- take out the expense of providing just a pure newspaper approach to their offering to their customers. So it's a win-win for both of us.",,,
Alexia S. Quadrani,Gracia C. Martore,"I guess, on that front, is the goal eventually to maybe to migrate completely to a digital model for USA TODAY? And then secondly, I guess, any thoughts on maybe a potential paywall on USATODAY.com?","I think I would reiterate what I said at the beginning, which is that we are going to follow consumers wherever they take us. What we're now seeing in these 4 pilots that we have done is that our customers in those markets love receiving additional USA TODAY content in their local newspaper. So there's -- I believe there's going -- for quite a period of time, there's going to be people who want to receive their content from USA TODAY in the print form, but more and more consumers are going to want to receive that content on their smartphones, on their iPads. We need to be wherever consumers want to be -- want to access that content. And we believe it will morph over time, but I don't think we're sitting here suggesting that digital-only is in the short term where we're going to be. And a paywall for USA TODAY, I will leave that to no current plans.",,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Gracia C. Martore,"
Just a couple of questions on the newspaper segment. The first is on the paywall. I just wanted to understand the math behind the $100 million gain in operating revenues -- I mean, sorry, the operating income. Because if we go back to 2011 and compare the revenues, circulation revenue to that period for the first 3 months -- 3 quarters of this year, then you're just slightly ahead of what you were doing then. And if I remember correctly, you'd guided us to an operating margin of about 50% in that business. So the revenues are just slightly ahead. Then just from a -- just mathematically, the margins can only be higher than $100 million if the operating margins are a lot higher than 50%.
","Okay. I think what you're looking at is our total circulation revenue, which would include USA TODAY, Newsquest as well as U.S. Community Publishing. Well, obviously we have the benefit of knowing those numbers as they pertain to each one of those businesses. And we have been scrupulous in viewing those numbers. And if you look at where they are, there's several components you have to look at when you simply look at the 78 markets within U.S. Community Publishing that had the benefit of the all-access content subscription model. So you start with gross revenues, then you have to take that down for additional marketing, additional other things that we do. And in fact, those numbers are very much on track to realize the $100 million of operating revenue -- operating profit.",,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Victoria Dux Harker,"

Then just from a -- just mathematically, the margins can only be higher than $100 million if the operating margins are a lot higher than 50%.
","And that was the rate -- that was the target, the metric that was put out at the time we had launched the all-access content subscription model in the spring of the prior year. So that's the apples-to-apples in terms of those 78 markets and the benefit of this particular rollout.",,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Gracia C. Martore,"Okay. The second question was, in terms of the newspaper business, now post the Belo acquisition, is there any thought behind the newspaper business as a standalone entity towards a less [ph] modest or something? And can you just give us your thoughts on why it should be part of the consolidated entity?","Sure. A couple of things, Kannan. First of all, I think for the foreseeable future, certainly into 2014, our #1 focus is on closing on and integrating Belo and achieving all of the synergies, if not more, that we shared with you when we announced the Belo transaction. So that's incredibly high on our list of things and our priorities right at the moment. I'd say secondly, as we've discussed, I think, several times is the fact that when we look at our publishing markets and our broadcasting markets, we really don't look at them as publishing or broadcasting solely. We look at them as local markets where we have incredibly strong brands, where we have been for a very long time, where we have rich, deep relationships with literally thousands of businesses, both large and small. And so when we look at things like what I'm talking about with G/O Digital and our digital marketing services business, what we are finding is as we've rolled that out across both publishing markets and broadcasting markets is that they are equally successful in generating additional digital revenues because businesses in those communities, in addition to wanting to have print or broadcast advertising, also understand the importance of reaching consumers on digital platforms and in ways that are more attractive on a digital basis. And that is true of the businesses we go at, whether they're in a -- whether we happen to have as our main brand in that market a title like The Des Moines Register or a title like WUSA Channel 9 here in D.C. And so we see the incredible opportunity we have to scale these additional businesses like G/O Digital across 111-plus markets locally in this country where we have common characteristics and common advantages. And we just see that as a unique huge opportunity that, frankly, no one else has. And so that's why we see this as -- we don't just look at them as publishing and broadcasting markets. We look at them as local markets where we have incredible advantages. And we have the ability to scale technology platforms and other things across 111-plus local markets in this country, which is pretty extraordinary for anyone.",,,
Victoria Dux Harker,Gracia C. Martore,"And just to take that to a very specific example from an investment standpoint, as Gracia pointed out, we have a much broader platform across all 3 of our business to advertise investment. We will be spending $110 million in CapEx this year, 2/3 of which are so are on the products that are around digital, which are now being developed, trained and rolled out across different channels. So we -- absent having that broad footprint across the segments, you'd have to spend incrementally more to develop them separately. And I think that's a huge advantage that we gained through efficiencies of our investment.","All of that being said, for the time being, we're incredibly focused on integrating Belo. We're incredibly focused on developing the businesses we've talked about. But as with everything, we are always looking at it. Our board, whenever we meet with them, we're always looking at different alternatives. But at the end of the day, what we're in this business to do is to create additional shareholder value. And that's what we're focused on doing",,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Gracia C. Martore,"Okay. So one last question is on classified ventures. I mean, there's been a news flow more recently on Apartments.com and so on. What's your thought on that asset? I mean, is there a point at which you basically sell that asset and monetize it?","I think we're just going to have to see. Right now, as you said, we are looking at -- all of the partners are looking at the strategic alternatives around apartments.com. We'll just see -- have to see how that unfolds. The other thing I would say is that when you look at the cars.com business, it's a terrific business. When you think about where auto sales and new car sales are going to be this year and the fact that prognostications are that next year is going to be another potentially a $16 million plus new car sales unit year, that's a very, very good business. And we'll just see how it continues to grow in the best way to maximize value there down the road.",,,
James C. Goss,Gracia C. Martore,"A couple related to Broadcasting first. Given that there's been an industry rollout in the broadcast sector, Belo -- and your Belo deal is certainly a big part of it, I'm wondering in terms of the overall environment, is there a sense of urgency, sort of make hay while the sun shines, or is it -- is there any more calm approach you can take before taking the next step of another acquisition perhaps in that area as you integrate Belo? And related -- sort of unrelated in Broadcasting, curious about the logic of your Captivate move. Did you take that as far as you thought you could on your own and you thought this was an additive issue? You might talk about that a moment.","Sure. With respect to the industry roll-up, I like to think we take a calm approach to everything. And there were lots of deals that were being done before Belo, and there will probably be lots of deals done after Belo. For us the Belo deal was a unique opportunity to expand into some incredibly great markets. Texas and the Pacific Northwest where, number one, we didn't have any exposure; number two, which were faster growing markets than the average in country. It enabled us to increase our scale in a very meaningful way to become the -- will allow us to become the #1 CBS affiliate group, reinforce our #1 status with NBC and become the fourth-largest affiliate group for ABC, where we had been nowhere with them before. So it had a lot of characteristics, a lot of great markets that we were interested in. And we believe that scale really does matter. And at this point with the Belo transaction, we'll be covering close to about 30% of the country. That's very good scale for us. Could we move some pieces around or do some other small things? Sure, but we don't feel any pressure to go out there and do a deal that doesn't make good financial sense and create shareholder value very quickly. With respect to Captivate, what we saw there -- we like our Captivate business very much, but I think what all of us have come to realize in the out-of-home space is that there's a need for some consolidation and there's a need for scale in that business as well. And we have a unique opportunity with Generation Partners to combine our assets with their ability and willingness to fund capital going forward, both from a capital expenditure standpoint, as well as potentially a roll-up strategy going forward, while we continue to have a piece of that business and enjoy the potential upside to that business, while getting some return on our investment to start with. So it just was a unique situation on an asset that we believe needs to be consolidated into a broader out-of-home play.",,,
James C. Goss,Gracia C. Martore,"Okay. Gracia, a couple more smaller ones, I think. Do you -- is there a perceived opportunity in terms of mobile ad sales you feel developing with the USA TODAY and the tablets and smartphones? And is there some pricing and volume you think you'll be able to generate in that area? And then with regard to the digital moves, are there smaller vehicles with bigger potential? You mentioned Shoplocal or DealChicken. Are some of those ones that you think will have -- play an increasingly large role as time goes in?","Let me start with the mobile question, and anybody that would like to jump in, feel free to. We see enormous opportunity in mobile and especially at USA TODAY but really across our entire set of businesses. USA TODAY has put up some phenomenal increases in mobile users and page views and in all the mobile metrics that make it just an outstanding vehicle. And we see opportunities certainly arising with our ability to monetize mobile in a much more meaningful way. And so we're continually working on that both at USA TODAY as well as, frankly, across all of our mobile platforms, whether they are in broadcast or in our publishing side of the business. So just a huge opportunity, we believe, going forward and something that we're carefully working on. I will tell you that the area that we're also focused on is video because video right now carries a very attractive eCPM. We have increased our video views across the company in an extraordinary way, and we have a lot more that we're doing in that area. And we see some opportunity there, especially having a very expanded broadcasting business, together with our video production center down in Atlanta, to really be able to maximize the video opportunity in a much more meaningful way over the next several years.",,,
Barry L. Lucas,Gracia C. Martore,"Okay. Gracia, a couple more smaller ones, I think. Do you -- is there a perceived opportunity in terms of mobile ad sales you feel developing with the USA TODAY and the tablets and smartphones? And is there some pricing and volume you think you'll be able to generate in that area? And then with regard to the digital moves, are there smaller vehicles with bigger potential? You mentioned Shoplocal or DealChicken. Are some of those ones that you think will have -- play an increasingly large role as time goes in?","Sure, Barry. Let me take the first 2, and then Dave will talk about spats since I apparently don't like to talk about spats. With respect to approvals, obviously, as we all know, the government was shut down for 16 or 17 days. That included the FCC and the DOJ. I assume that they're getting ramped back up after being offline and not checking e-mails and all those wonderful things. We are doing everything that we can, obviously, internally to close the deal, as we previously have indicated. It's not obviously entirely in our hands. We don't control the FCC or the DOJ or what their lineup is right at the moment, given they were not on track for over 2 weeks. But we are moving as expeditiously as we possibly can. With respect to Aereo, as I've mentioned before, we just believe that there's been lawsuits all over the place. Some have obviously been very favorable; some of them have been unfavorable. I think ultimately, as we've said, we suspect that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide on it, but we continue to believe that the copyright laws of the United States of America should prevail. We believe that when we provide content that we should be paid for providing that content. I think that underlies what's happening in retrans and underlies what we've done with our all-access content subscription model. And so we ultimately believe that the copyright laws of this country will prevail. But Dave, you want to comment on?",,,
Barry L. Lucas,David T. Lougee,"Just a couple of quickies really on the TV side. One on the approvals process, and particularly DOJ, any color you can give there, as well as the FCC. And then two would be the, I would say broader threats to broadcast. Any thoughts you have and can share on Aereo and Barry Diller and/or this little spat that's grown up with [indiscernible] and DISH and Media General. And it doesn't appear to me to be an argument over $0.05 or $0.10 per sub per month. So any thoughts on any of those subjects will be greatly appreciated.","On the DISH and Media General, I don't think we should comment specifically on any particular company's negotiation. But generally, I'd just say, as the NAB has pointed out, that in the very, very few cases where there's been any kind of discontinuance of service, it's been 1 or 2 providers for the most part or 3 across, and that we don't believe that's an accident. As it relates to us in terms of risk mitigation, we have very strong stations that are very valuable to the consumers in our markets and like our situation relative to our value proposition. I don't know if Marci Ryvicker is on the call, but Wells Fargo put out a piece just a couple of months ago that talked about accurately so that, I think, in 2012 broadcasters will account for 35% of all of the viewing nationwide and yet 7% of the subscriber fees. So what you have there is still a lack of market alignment that is positive for the industry overall. And irrespective of what may happen with an individual negotiation with other companies, the truth is on our side, as we'd like to say, as it relates to the market realities.",,,
