Jaeson Schmidt,Kurt Busch,"First one, wondering Kurt if you could comment on any particular notable trends that you’re seeing from a geographical perspective?","Sure. First of all thanks for calling in Jaeson, it’s great to hear from you. So we’ve seen most of the weakness we’ve seen in capital spending is really where our enterprise business is the strongest and that’s in North America. Today we see Europe holding up pretty well, but enterprise is relatively small there as well as enterprise is relatively small outside the United States. So from a geographic point of view the weakness is primarily in the enterprise capital spending areas of North America.

Jaeson Schmidt,Kurt Busch,"And then I know you guys have some early nice partnerships or relationships with Verizon, Medtronic, NetApp. Can you just comment on how those are progressing and if you’re seeing additional traction in that each of those customers?","Sure. So a key part of our go-to-market strategy is to engage with tier 1 accounts to develop new products. And typically we see early revenue from those tier 1 accounts such as the one that you mentioned and then we push it out into our foreign retail channels on a worldwide basis. So we’re still very encouraged to work with those customers. Many of those customers place large orders on a lumpy category. Some quarters they're strong, some quarters they are not. And that’s basically the nature of this kind of enterprise business. And we’re really looking forward to working with these guys on next generation products.

"
Jaeson Schmidt,Kurt Busch,"Okay. And then the last on before I jump back into queue. Just wondering if you could comment on your overall visibility, I know the capital spending is impacting some of your businesses now, but how confident are you with that looking at the second half of this calendar year that you could really see some nice growth?
","So typically, we see good design wins and we see good evaluations and basically good customer feedback to show with the new products or gaining traction. Much of our businesses through distribution sales, through distribution channels and we recognize revenue on self through. So very often, we don’t have a lot of visibility to with the final revenue number for any particularly quarters going to be until that quarter is over.

"
Mark Spiegel,Kurt Busch,"Hey guys. I see two good things in this report. And unfortunately it looks almost like only two good things, but they might be meaningful. Sequential revenue overall was down 2.7% with last quarter was down 7% versus the quarter before that. Has the business stabilized in terms of revenue?
","And right now Mark it’s -- well first of all Mark thank you for calling in. I mean we believe that given the traction we’re seeing on the next generation products that we’re working to stabilize that revenue. But again we don’t have really good visibility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we are very positive about the outlook.

"
Mark Spiegel,Kurt Busch," Okay. I don’t know what have the operator kind of came in and cut me off there. The new products are sequentially flat from last quarter. So why is that? Kurt Busch Sure. So new products were flat, but quarter-over-quarter and reps are pretty encouraged by that, because we've seen a good amount of weakness in capital spending and most of those new products are in the enterprise space where that weakness of capital spending has been occurring. The weakness we see in specific is North America enterprise capital spending. And the fact that we’re able to achieve just, I’d say, flat new products quarter-on-quarter, I chop that up as a win, because we did see a pretty good decrease in the legacy enterprise businesses quarter-on-quarter.","Sure.

Mark Spiegel,Kurt Busch,"So we’re now, I don’t know five years into this alleged economic recovery, which if you saw the GDP report this morning is really not much of recovery at all. What makes you think that enterprise capital spending is going to comeback if that hasn’t comeback by now?

","So we’ve really seen the weakness just in the last two quarters Mark. And I don’t have good projection whether or not this is a two quarter weakness or one year weakness. I think probably some of the bigger enterprise data companies might have better visibility to us. But we basically are seeing weakness and push out. I haven’t really seen any deals cancel, but we have seen slowness; and getting the POs through and whether or not they happen in this quarter, the next quarter is still uncertain.

","Last one, as I said one of the good things is that you’ve appeared to have generated around $200,000 in cash this quarter. Now you mentioned a letter of credit, I don’t know how that works into that, and can you talk a little bit about cash consumption going forward?

","Yeah, so just give you a little bit more flavor around the letter of credit is that we repurchase the raw materials from one of our contract manufacturer in connection with a transition to a new contract manufacturer. So we use the letter of credit to repurchase that material. That was about $600,000 and so that was not paid until April. So that had a positive impact this quarter and it will have a negative impact coming into the next quarter.

"
Mark Spiegel,"Jeremy Whitaker
","So you really consumed around $400,000 in cash, is what you’re saying?

","Well right now we’re operating within a couple of $100,000 of breakeven and so if we continue to operate at a similar level I would not expect significant cash consumption. It should be similar to that.

"
Mark Spiegel,"Jeremy Whitaker
","And do you have any color on what that’s going to look like going forward, the cash consumption?


","Yes, I mean that’s a good way to look at it.

"
Mark Spiegel,"Jeremy Whitaker
","So in another quarter you’re just reporting what is I mean, all those to be equal, essentially $400,000 of consumption you’re saying. When you say right now you’re within 200,000 [indiscernible] like, the quarter we’re in right now -- I mean that you’ve cut it by another 200,000?


","No, the quarter we've just reported down, had about $300,000 non-GAAP loss which is pretty close to our cash consumption.


"
Mark Spiegel,Kurt Busch,"So any color on your cutting expense I mean at this level of revenue, is that where that’s going to stay?

","Right now Mark we’re working to grow revenue and control expenses as well as is working to improve margin. I mean as you saw we had a drop in margin this quarter. And all of those things will get us back to -- we’re working to get us back to cash breakeven, or get us back to the point where we were generating cash which we were doing in last fiscal year.
