Jessica Fye,Gary Hattersley,"I wanted to ask a couple about the elacestrant study. Specifically, can you help us think about what you expect the mix of dealers' choice and the current therapies to be in that trial? And then your patients have seen Aromatase inhibitor early on, potentially a third and the second line, what do you expect them to be randomized to in the control arm of your study? And then in addition, I think you mentioned an interim look in that one. Can you talk about when you project that might occur from a timing standpoint or what number of patients or progression of events would be triggered -- would trigger that interim?","At this point, we're not providing guidance on the details of the study. That’s just something that we will do once the study is initiated in the second half of this year. But certainly when we look at the types of hormonal agents that are used in a late line setting, there are relatively small number of options; and of course, as I think we try to highlight with some of the data here and at San Antonio, when we look at the response rates and the PFS for those hormonal agents in a late line setting, I think we have a very good handle on how they perform and I think it makes us very encouraged that elacestrant really has the potential to perform very well against the comparator, but again we’ll provide more details when the study is initiated. We have guided that we are intending to perform an interim analysis. At this point, we're not providing any further detail around when that patent information may be available."
Jessica Fye,Gary Hattersley,"And maybe just following up on that, is there a call in your Phase 1, patients had seen a number of prior therapies, including multiple different endocrine therapies, but should we expect the idea that these patients may have already seen multiple endocrine therapies to pose any enrollment challenges if an investigator might say, I’d love for you to try 1901 , but not sure you should be trying another product that you might have already failed on for example.","That's a very good question. We know in this late line setting, as you described, many of these patients will have progressed through several hormonal therapies earlier in treatments. It's not uncommon for hormonal agents to be reintroduced in a late line. Obviously, these patients have relatively few treatment options on certainly I think when we think about how elacestrant could perform in this late line setting or how we've seen it perform in our ongoing phase 1 study, again against patients that have previously received these endocrine agents, I think we feel very encouraged by Elacestrant’s potential."
Jessica Fye,Gary Hattersley,"And maybe just last one on the patch study. Can you talk about your assumptions for enrolment? I just want to make sure I understand, as you're starting the study in mid-19 and expect to see data on a 12-month endpoint in 2020. Is it fair to imply you expect to get 500 patients enrolled in six months?","Obviously, we're not providing specific guidance around enrolment. Certainly, Radius has a long history of conducting many BMD studies through the course of development for abaloparatide. So, I think we have a very good handle on what it would take to enroll these patients, how many sites that we would expect to be able to enroll these patients quickly. We certainly think with the study design in which patients are going to receive either the subcutaneous injection or the abaloparatide patch that this could be quite a -- study of patients may be enthusiastic about taking part in."
Jessica Fye,Gary Hattersley,"Forgive me, but just one more on the patch, can you just talk a little bit more about how you got comfortable or convinced that the BMD effect is really AUC driven and not affected by the shape of the curve, now that it looks like you're very close on AUC but have moved away on Cmax and Tmax.","Yeah. So the Cmax and the Tmax is the same -- within the target for subcutaneous injection, but it's really heavily driven by our experience with our active Phase 3 dataset. That is a very rich dataset in which we have several thousand PK data points as well as we have BMD values from a large number of patients across multiple time points. That's really been a data set that’s allowed us to construct this exposure response model to be able to look at multiple PK parameters, and I think our analysis, where we input the transdermal patch data into that model gives us a very high degree of confidence that the patch we have right now is optimized patch, has the profile that it needs to be able to achieve the BMD endpoints and to be successful in a non-inferiority BMD study."
Matthew Harrison,Gary Hattersley,"I think maybe two from me. So first on the SERD. Can you just talk about, when you think about registration timelines in the US and the EU, I think we focused a little bit less on the EU. How this strategy will accelerate your timeline in the EU and how quickly if you can use the study, you might be able to get registered in the EU as well?","Yeah. I think that's an important part of our strategy is to, we see elacestrant as having important global value and so this comparator study, we believe, could be sufficient to support registration, both in the US and EU. So we believe that's actually one of the potential values for the study. Of course comparing to hormonal comparator as well, I think we’ll provide some very compelling information to understand the potential benefits of elacestrant."
Matthew Harrison,Jesper Hoiland,"I think maybe two from me. So first on the SERD. Can you just talk about, when you think about registration timelines in the US and the EU, I think we focused a little bit less on the EU. How this strategy will accelerate your timeline in the EU and how quickly if you can use the study, you might be able to get registered in the EU as well?","Matthew, this is Jesper speaking. Just to add on to it, when we discussed with potential partners, we’ve got the insight that they sincerely wanted us to go this way for us to create a partnership, so that we took into consideration and when we learned back from EMEA, we decided that this was the best way forward to create maximum value."
Matthew Harrison,Gary Hattersley,"And then second, you mentioned some non-clinical supportive studies that you need to run with the patch, maybe, could you just be a little bit more specific about what those studies are? And then I guess from a manufacturing standpoint, what sort of data and stability you need to provide to the FDA?","Yeah. Absolutely. So the supportive clinical and clinical study has really fallen to category of being sort of routine part of drug development. So, there are some additional preclinical dermal tolerance studies that we expect to conduct. Certainly, very routine studies, very clear guidance on what is expected for those studies. They're absolutely not rate limiting for our development path. I'm sorry, you had a second part to the question. Oh, stability. So we expect, as is typical to have to have 12 months of stability from our commercial line to be available at the time of NDA submission."
Matthew Harrison,Gary Hattersley,"And then sorry one other follow-up that I just wanted to ask, can you just detail in terms of PK data that you have on slide 31, how many patients – what was the sample size that you had to generate the AUC exposure, can you have any arrow bars on here, how variable was the response and how confident do you feel in patch to patch variability.","That's actually a great and actually a very important question. So the dataset you're looking at on that slide is derived from 20 patients with our optimized patch. And so from a PK perspective, that's actually quite a rich dataset that does actually give us a very good handle on what the variability of the patch is and I think we're very encouraged to see that that patch variability is in line with what we see with subcutaneous injection and that's even a prepay experience with our prototypes as well. And also that, when we’ve conducted this exposure response analysis, putting this transdermal PK data into that model, one of the things that it looks at is also the inherent variability. So when you see the estimated mean and 95% confidence intervals for the BMD change on I think slide 32, you're actually seeing the integrated effects of variability in that model as well again, which I think gives us high degree of confidence that we have a patch that is suitable to go into the pivotal study with a great probability of success."
Ying Huang,Gary Hattersley,"I have also a couple of quick ones on the patch. First, can you tell us a little bit more about the 20 patient study? Are they all on the patch therefore, you're not comparing directly to any patients on the subcu in the same trial? ","Your other question was really related to how much PK data have we collected. Really over the last almost 18 months, we've conducted many PK clinical Phase 1 PK studies with multiple iterations and multiple variations with the transdermal patch. There have been many variables that have been assessed and so we've actually had patients that have cycled through several different patch prototypes. We have included periodically subcu injection arms within those studies. So we continue to capture subcu data as part of that. And so when we look at all of that information, I think we're really able to get a good handle on the profile of subcu of course as well as the profile of the optimized patch and it's really let us to a point where we are actually extremely comfortable with the patch that we have, its ability to deliver the profile that we needed to and again it's a patch that we're very, very enthusiastic about seeing moving into a pivotal study."
Ying Huang,Gary Hattersley,"And secondly besides that AUC, what other PK or PD parameters are you collecting, so that you feel confident about the bioequivalent between the subcu and the patch formulation? Lastly, how confident are you that you will be able to enroll 500 patients in a relatively short period of time so that you can stick to your timeline of 2020 NDA preparation?","Let me take the last question first. As I think I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, Radius does have a lot of experience in conducting osteoporosis studies, some based on BMD endpoints, some based on fracture end points. So this is a study population that we understand well. We’ve conducted many studies. So, I think we have a very good handle on the enrolment times, the number of sites that we will need, the kinds of sites and the kinds of geographies that we would want to go into. So we have confidence in our ability to conduct this study as quickly as we reasonably can."
Ying Huang,Gary Hattersley,Just a quick follow-up. So you had more than 20 patients on this current patch formulation in the Phase 1 trials?,"The dataset you are seeing is derived from 20 patients. There have been a lot more different variations, a number of different iterations of this patch that have been evaluated over the course of the last 18 months."
Kevin Patel,Gary Hattersley,This is Kevin Patel on for Salveen. First question is for the elacestrant compare and controlled study. How long will it take to data?,"So, at this point, we're actually not guiding in terms of how long it will take us to enroll the elacestrant study. We’re guiding to when the study would be initiated, which is the first half of -- I'm sorry, second half of 2018. Obviously, it's a high priority for us, we're looking to execute this study as quickly as possible and to enroll as quickly as reasonably possible."
Kevin Patel,Joe Kelly,"And then the second one is for TYMLOS, you have exclusive status to Express Scripts, so what percentage of Express Scripts patients are you tracking over the quarter and how are you thinking about compliance?","So when you look at what ESI represents from a commercial standpoint in the anabolic space, it's about 18%. Looking at total number of lives, there's about 57 million, of which 24 million, we do have preferred status with TYMLOS and right now, we are meeting expectations as far as what we've set as a goal to be at from a market share standpoint and also the goal that we agreed upon with Express Scripts, but we’ll be sure to update you on the next call that we have together, it's a bit early in the game as far as accurate data at the point, but I can say that both sides are satisfied with where we are right now."
Kevin Patel,Pepe Carmona,"Just one follow-up, based off of the trends you're seeing now, do you still expect to provide guidance on the 1Q call?","So the expectation is that at the end of -- when we present the Q1 earnings call, we will give guidance in certain KPI aspects of the business for full year 2018."
Greg Harrison,Pepe Carmona,"With regards to the TYMLOS price increase, what proportion of that increase do you expect to realize and what is your strategy with respect to balancing the price that reflects the value of the drug with also having -- keeping the lower price in Forteo and trying to use that to grow the market to where it had been previously.","So in terms of what portion of 5.9% goes to net, we haven't guided specifically on that, but we do expect a large portion of it to be reflected in net sales. As always when you have price increases like this and you have contracts with multiple players, you have administration fees, a few things that kick in. So it's going to be a portion of that, but it’s the larger majority of it. From a pricing strategy perspective, we believe that we will continue to take price increases that are responsible to the market. We need to recall we're obviously cost -- this cost increase is from salaries to FDA fees to other things that we will continue to ensure that those are recovered of the business. We are still about far distance from our competitor on reporting to the market. So we don't see this as diminishing the potential of TYMLOS to continue penetrating and becoming market leader."
Greg Harrison,Jesper Hoiland,"With regards to the TYMLOS price increase, what proportion of that increase do you expect to realize and what is your strategy with respect to balancing the price that reflects the value of the drug with also having -- keeping the lower price in Forteo and trying to use that to grow the market to where it had been previously.","So Greg, if I may add to it, just because price is of my sincere interest and the price differentiation that you have seen is of course also, you need to think about the potential entry of a biosimilar by end of 2019. So we have put ourselves as a point where we feel we can very much compete with whoever comes into the space at that point of time, because the typical way forward for the biosimilars is of course being to take a 20% to 30% price decrease of the whack and thereby going in and within 180 days skim the market if you will. We are taking a very different price approach because if that's what the biosimilars are going to do, then they will still be in the 30,000 when we are in the early 20,000. So as far as I'm concerned, we are in a very, very strong position going forward with the price point that we have provided on here. So all in all, we will navigate in the space, we have got the market access that we wanted, that's also a very important component of course within 9 months to have 259 million lives to be covered I think speaks for itself and that's of course a part of the pricing strategy that we set up with in the very initial phase."
Greg Harrison,Jesper Hoiland,"Just one more if I can on the patch trial. So if you were to hit the non-inferiority margin statistically, but still being numerically below subcutaneous, would that be a problem clinically for doctors and for marketing to patients?",We are debating it. We should answer it.
Greg Harrison,Pepe Carmona,"Just one more if I can on the patch trial. So if you were to hit the non-inferiority margin statistically, but still being numerically below subcutaneous, would that be a problem clinically for doctors and for marketing to patients?","At the end of the day, the bridging studies that was agreed with the FDA for BMD is if we keep that number within that range, so above that threshold, we will have an approved product and obviously it will apply the TYMLOS label to it. Competitive wise, I think those are different questions. I think that’s -- we will have a better understanding of how we're going to commercialize it later on."
Greg Harrison,Jesper Hoiland,"Just one more if I can on the patch trial. So if you were to hit the non-inferiority margin statistically, but still being numerically below subcutaneous, would that be a problem clinically for doctors and for marketing to patients?","And just think about the timelines that we've been up with the patch is very indicative of what -- should be indicative of what will be the thinking for the potential biosimilars entering into the market because we will, with the price point that we have come up with, have strongly indicated that we're going to change the name of the game coming out with a patch. And we're very, very encouraged with the signature of 3M, which happened earlier this week. So all in all, we feel that we are on the right way forward for Radius Health."
