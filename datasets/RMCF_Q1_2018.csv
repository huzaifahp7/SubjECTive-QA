Tim Call,Bryan Merryman,"When you look at your factory sales being stronger in the quarter, are there any new products or new retail relationships that – provided that strength, and do you expect any of that to continue in the future?","Mainly what was primarily driving increased sales was a 17.6% increase from a single customer and more in line with the previous, not last fiscal year, but the year before this quarter back up more to a level that they were two quarters ago in the first quarter. We do expect that to continue for the balance of the year. We expect growth of that customer. We also saw some positive same-store pounds purchased from our franchise system and saw a 2.4% increase in sales to our franchisees and licensees and have no reason to believe that that wouldn’t continue."
Tim Call,Bryan Merryman,"When looking at your strong cash flow, it’s been used to reinvest in the business with factory improvements and efficiencies, and that – you might be done with that project over the next year. And then you’ve used a lot of your free cash flow to pay down debt, so interest expense is falling by over 20% year-over-year, and eventually, you’re going to run on the debt to pay down. What do you see your uses of cash flow in future years?","If the company continues to grow at a fairly modest rate as it has in the past then I would imagine we would start considering dividend increases, as well as share buybacks. Right now we have some litigation going that we’re reserving some cash for. We think it’s not probable that we’ll lose, and we also have another year of healthy capital expenditures planned in the factory. So I think if the business performs over the next couple of quarters like it did in the first quarter here, we would begin to entertain a dividend increase. I think the company is from a cash standpoint in great shape, given every contingency that we know that’s out there right now. And I think this litigation would be over by the end of September. So heading into the fourth quarter of this year, we’ll have a better understanding where our cash position is and what we want to do in this fiscal year."
