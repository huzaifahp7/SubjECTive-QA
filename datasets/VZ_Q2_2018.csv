John Hodulik,Lowell C. McAdam,"OK. Great. Thanks. And Lowell, first, I'd like to say congrats on your retirement and your career at Verizon.
It's been really -- I've really enjoyed working with you over the years. And also quickly for Hans, it will be great working with you as we -- as you take the reins going forward. So, Lowell, during your tenure as CEO, you've really -- Verizon's really stuck to its core competency of a wireless network leadership, while other companies have moved to diversifying to adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment and adoption, do you believe that Verizon can sort of widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers? Thanks.
","Well, thanks, John. You know, I think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree of success. We talk about competing to win. We don't want to play to play, we want to play to win.
And we've looked at the things that we've done. Network leadership is at the core. It's part of the values of the company. Every individual here is proud of what we do, our network leadership.
And we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm the proudest of, it's the things that you've mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G is -- are some of those. I also have to say a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we had to do. And that's put us in a position now that Matt outlined, where we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got a clear strategy.
And I think we are going to put a significant distance between us and the competition. And the first mover on network generation changes usually gains a significant amount of market share. And with the assets that we have, we think we're in that position with 5G.
",,,
Simon Flannery,Hans Vestberg,"Great. Thank you. Good morning, and also wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell, good luck with your retirement. Good to hear the news about Houston.
You've talked about a $30 million-plus opportunity for the residential broadband. Can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of POPs covered over the next 12, 24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more. We've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets they're launched this year. How rapidly you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave? Or you're going to use some lower bands for the mobility 5G? Thank you.
","Yes. Thank you, Simon. This is Hans. So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, as we've said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning [Inaudible].
We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the NR standard that is coming out right now. And then there is again equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the material to be released to our customers. So that -- so that will come back when we go for the full 30 million households, which is our ambition that we have explained before.
So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access. On the mobility, we do the same. Remember, the intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network. So it's same radio base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility.
So we are, and as I said before -- I mean, we are now in deployment of fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the maturity of the equipment and the softwares as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products. And right now that's the ambition we've seen in 2019. We have not named the cities, but as you can hear we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber.
So I think that's an important point of it. That's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we are doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston. We are super excited over that. So we'll continue to come with the flow of information what we're doing on 5G.
",,,
Simon Flannery,Hans Vestberg,"And when should -- when should you launch the first of the Sacramento, L.A., Houston? Is that going to be in the third quarter or more likely the fourth?","Good question. As we say that in the second half of 2018, so we promise we will come out and tell you as soon as we know exactly the date.",,,
Philip Cusick,Hans Vestberg,"Hey, guys. Thanks again. Lowell, congratulations again. And Hans, congratulations, this should be a lot of fun.
Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the capex side to move toward the lower end of the guide. Are you doing less this year than you expected? Or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.
","Thank you very much. I think this is a great question. Remember, when I came in, we decided together with Matt, Lowell, and the whole management to actually flip the whole network to the sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that: one, we wanted to leave a new type of services based on horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G, and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly.
The second was that we also can be so much more efficient with new technologies and multipurpose equipment. At the same time, we put in the new process for capital efficiency, that Matt and I are sharing. And I think that's what you're seeing right now. We're actually doing much more than before, when it comes to deployment than as we say, hey, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we are preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.
At the same time, we also are making a big shift in the whole spending. I mean, if I look at what we spent in 2017 and the capital or capex and in 2018, it's very different. So we're also making a shift at all time. But this is nothing that we're limiting.
We are more efficient on using our capital. And my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I would say, if you go back a couple of years ago, our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cell.
So we have shift dramatically over the years, and I've only been part of it now for more than one year, but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you see in the figures.
",,,
Philip Cusick,Matthew D. Ellis ,"If I can follow up, anything you can tell us given that efficiency about where 2019 capex might be upward or downward from 2018? Thank you.
","Yes. Good morning, Phil, it's Matt. So I'll take that one. As -- we will stay consistent with what we've done in the past where we'll talk about 2019 we get closer to it.
But I think we've been pretty consistent in our commentary that, look, we expect capex to be reasonably consistent and as we [Audio gap] and opportunities to accelerate any spend on 5G as we see it, but it's a little too early in the process to get -- I'll just remind you, as Hans said, a lot of the spending that we've been doing around densification, suppose, both 4G and 5G. So the network really is in a great position to be prepositioned for us moving into 5G here without requiring a significant step change in total spend. We've done this before as we move from one generation of technology to another and keeping total capex spend fairly consistent and we're confident we'll do that again.
",,,
David Barden,Matthew D. Ellis,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks, again, Lowell, congrats to you and Hans. Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower-tax guide.
Could you talk about the reasons why that is, and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation? And do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about, I think, as we've done, historically, some of the changes in the union contract forthcoming, how should we think about that impact on the cost structure? I know you gave us about a 20% margin in the wireline side for this year. But is that -- did those negotiations give you some window and potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.
","Yup. Thanks, David. So I'll start with the tax question. So as you look at the first half of the year, the ETR was impacted certainly by tax reform, but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter, but you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year.
So that's why we're guiding toward the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow. I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We did not have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payment, as you know.
Second quarter, we had the first two scheduled payments for the year, and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year, and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year. So expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate. I'll let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.

David Barden,Lowell C. McAdam,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks, again, Lowell, congrats to you and Hans. Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower-tax guide.

But is that -- did those negotiations give you some window and potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.
","Yes. David, we're -- we're really pleased with the relationship that we built with the union. During the last contract, we get together at the senior level very frequently. We've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both the union leadership and members as well as the company.
So when we decided -- attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of exploration that was a major change in our relationship. And I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections, I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen. We do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing, but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract.
But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers, and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike. And so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.
",,,
Brett Feldman,Matthew D. Ellis,"Thanks. And I'd also like to extend my congrats to Lowell for a distinguished career and to Hans for the opportunity that lies ahead. I was hoping I could ask about postpaid ARPA. That metric has been under pressure for the last several years, although it's shown a lot of stabilization recently.
And even though you don't breakout phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that pressure as subs moved into EIP and more recently into the unlimited plans. It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us. I'm not entirely sure we are in the migration to the new unlimited plan. So I guess, I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward? Do we still have any headwind on the phone side? Is that becoming a tailwind? And then, of course, you've highlighted that you were seeing a lot of other devices, including wearables coming into your accounts.
Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.
","Good morning, Brett, thanks for the questions. So as you look at ARPA, you're right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete, the year-over-year difference in terms of the percentage of the base on unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits, whereas a year ago it was much more significant. So that shows up in the ARPA. The other good thing that's in the ARPA though is you continue to see the demand for our products and services.
So we continued in the quarter to have customers step up in terms of the plans thereon, whether that be from a metered plan to unlimited or even within our unlimited plans that we offer, and then we continue to see increases in connections per account, whether that be wearables or additional phones on the account. Those things are coming through to ARPA, and you see the impact there on service revenue overall. So certainly, ARPA is stabilizing and we think as we continue to offer the right plans to customers and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans, that it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.
",,,
Brett Feldman,Matthew D. Ellis,Have you broken out how many of your customers are on limited plan? I apologize if I missed that.,"We have not. As we said previously, between unlimited and Verizon 2.0 plans where customers have the ability to control overage, that have been significantly above 50%, and certainly the number of customers on unlimited continues to grow, but we haven't broken out at this point, but it's becoming certainly a larger and larger percentage of the base.",,,
Michael Rollins,Hans Vestberg,"Hi. Thanks. And I also like to extend my best wishes to Lowell and congrats to Hans. Just a couple of topics, if I could.
First on the strategic side. As I listened to the management commentary over the past year, is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on-the-go across the country? And if this is the direction, how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends. Postpaid phone growth at the industry level has risen to more than twice the rate of population growth. Do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change? And the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.
","So maybe I can start with the network question that you had and broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have and I've been now working here for quite a while, I really like the assets we have and the ones we're building, that will give us the opportunity to be a much larger broadband provider. And I think the announcement that we did today that we now are having Houston as well and we will continue with that communication on the new cities we are going to deploy on. 5G gives us that opportunity.
But we need to remember when I talk about 5G, 5G is an access technology. There is so much more you need to do to actually have it. When I look what we're doing all the way from the data center with fiber, unified transport, multiservice routers the all way, I see that this is a big undertaking, but we are in the midst of it, and as I have said a couple of times before, I mean, we have been on to this Intelligent Edge Network right now for quite a while, and we see the benefits and we see the opportunity that it creates. So you're right, it, of course, is going to take time to have it across the country.
But as I mentioned, we're already now deploying fiber in 50 cities. So we will come back and give you more color to it. But I think we are preparing the network to be really using the network and levering the efficiency market. So that's for us a very important piece of it.

","On the postpaid phone, we continue, you know, to see consumer demand there and we believe certainly when you give customers the opportunity to get on the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there. So I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall. But we certainly continue to see good consumer demand and we expect to continue to have postpaid phone net add growth going forward. And we'll see how that plays out across the rest of the industry.
But one other comment I'd just add on the network side is, in addition to the broadband piece, as we've talked about the strategy is it's once you have that pace, what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward, and we think we're in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps your questions, Mike.

","And Mike, I think I'd just add one thing. It's funny, when you're at this point in your career, you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions, but just asked in a different way. I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99, and we had about 20% market penetration on, you know, postpaid, and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where's the industry going. You can't possibly get any more penetration than you've gotten.
And at that point, I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans' home country, that was at 50% penetration, and we thought, ""Gee, we got all sorts of headroom."" And now we're over a 100% penetration and you see wearables, and with 5G, Hans mentioned this and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives. So, you know, I really don't think much about postpay or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth. There are so many things and we have literally 0% penetration in today that are going to be big businesses five years from now. That's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership team's philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing them the products that they're going to need -- that will be indispensable five years from now.

Craig Moffett,Lowell C. McAdam,"Hi. Good morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell. Lowell, it really has been a pleasure and also congratulations to you, Hans. I look forward to your great success.
Let me ask a strategic question about video, if I could. You discontinued go90 in the quarter. There have at least been press reports about -- at least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath and whether Oath -- addressable advertising might actually be more successful outside the company instead of inside the company? I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing, and now that you've had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising? And then as part of that, if you could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath that would be helpful.
","Yes. So let me deal with those in reverse order there, Craig, and then I'll let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath, I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format -- excuse me.
We see the synergies that we expected to see and we see the future that we'd hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks, the integration efforts that are going on, they're on schedule, and so we see no reason to do that and there is no credible report out there that otherwise in my view. So I'll be clear about that. On the video side, look, that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today.
We only expect that to go up over time. We're not fans of linear, but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here. It's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want to make. It's much better in our view to do digital.
So we're, as we've always said, skating to where the puck is going. So that's where we're focused. I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago. Hans went and we met with all of the major content providers, the sports leagues, the healthcare, education, gaming all of those segments and every one of them when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially, the latency, certainly, along with the capacity, but when they see the legacy, their eyes light up about what's possible.
So my view is, and I know Hans shares this, we've developed these strategies together. He's always been one of my go-to guys over the last five years to see where the industry is going. But it's our belief that we're positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be successful. We're not going to be owning contents or not going to be competing with other content providers, we're going to be their best partner from a distribution perspective.
And I think that makes great sense for the company going forward.

Craig Moffett,Hans Vestberg,"Hi. Good morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell. Lowell, it really has been a pleasure and also congratulations to you, Hans. I look forward to your great success.

","And I can chime in here. I mean, I've been around now for quite a while both as leading this. But I've been sitting together with Lowell and management team and the board on the strategic decision we've done and I'm fully on-board on all of them. And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them, and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them, both leverage them and also get more synergies about all them.
And you're talking about the Oath, for example, I mean, today, with the massive confidence we have in Oath when it comes to AI, ML, and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization, that's great synergy and creating a lot of new possibilities for us. On the front end, we're constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our sort of the Verizon side and outside, and we will continue to find those ways forward. So I feel good about the assets we have, and I agree with Lowell that we can partner with them. And again we are betting on that we're going to have the best Network Intelligent Edge Network, we're going to have a great 5G, the best.
And of course, we can attract partners that we can work with. And I think that is a model that we have and that we can continue to develop. And I see only opportunities when you go to 5G when you can [Inaudible] platforms and applications, and here you can sort of define where you're going to play in that or where you're going to have partners. So I'm feeling encouraged about the assets we are having and what we can do with them.

Jennifer Fritzsche,Matthew D. Ellis,"Great. Thanks. Congratulations to both you gentlemen. Two, if I may.
Can I just explore the wireline capex component? It's down about $500 million from the first quarter, and yet I hear you're doing 50 fiber cities. Can you talk, Matt, maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that capex ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then, I guess, what does that mean for, what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter-wave spectrum. We do have an auction coming out in November. You guys have a lot of spectrums here.
Can you comment on interest, that that might be part of your focus come the fall?
","Thanks, Jennifer. So on the capex side. Certainly, as you look between first and second quarter, you've got timing in there. But as we build out fiber and as you say we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint we were deploying fiber today, you'll see a blurring of the line of the capex between the segments.
Obviously, that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment, but the largest customer from that build is the wireless piece of the business. So this is part of densifying the network, prepositioning the network to not just excel in 4G, but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of that spend. But the total capex number, as I said earlier, you should see consistency there.
And as you -- what you're seeing is the continued evolution of our capex from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber build-out is a key component of that. So you should expect to see the continuation of those trends, and it's part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G, and we're excited about that as we go forward. And I'll let Hans talk about millimeter wave.

You guys have a lot of spectrums here.
Can you comment on interest, that that might be part of your focus come the fall?
","Yes. When we think about data usage over network, we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need. First of all, we have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum. I think that the last round of spectrum we decided to densify, and I think that is now paying out very well for us.
Secondly, looking to new type of technology and features coming out in a network that can optimize everything from carrier aggregation etc. And lastly, we are, of course, looking to what spectrum we need to have. That is putting us in a very disciplined way how we use these three type of assets, where we decide what to do in order to have the best return on investment. Of course, we're looking into any auction that is coming up and see how that fits in, in that pattern of decision making with these different types of options.
So we will look into that, however, we are also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeter wave right now. But again, we will look into it, if there are any holes we need to fill in this process. But again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification looking into new features of the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed, and then we have the disciplined approach to our return on investment.

Matt Niknam,Hans Vestberg,"Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just two, if I could. One, on 5G, what are you hearing from your larger commercial enterprise customers in terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that could facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year? And then secondly, maybe for Matt, on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet.
How should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of excess capital and tax reform benefits, how do they potentially evolve into '19? Thanks.
","Let me start with the 5G and enterprise. You're right, when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or will have, I think that enterprise is a receiver of many of them when it comes to latency, security, launch throughputs and all of that. We are in constant dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services with them and, of course, we're building the Intelligent Edge Network, and here we have the definition at Edge how we do a specific slice for an enterprise, and that could be private 5G network with low latency or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity.
There are some features, if I be little bit deep on technology, that come out on the next revision of the NR 5G technology, which is on the revision 16, that will be even more important for our enterprise customer. But again, we are building this as we speak and we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together with them new type of services, where you're sort of doing a real-time enterprise based on wireless, which haven't been done before. So I think we are very far on our innovation and exploration in this area, and I see great opportunities in it.

","Yes. I'm Matt. On your question around tax reform and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation. Look, the capital allocation, we've talked about this numerous times, and we're focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders.
We know the dividend is important and we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now. And we've also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. And certainly tax reform helps accelerate our ability to do that. That's our focus for 2018.
You saw a good progress in the first half of the year, not just on the debt pay-down, but also when we say strengthen the balance sheet, we include the -- what we did with the pension contribution as well. So we're making good progress here. Too early to give specific views on 2019. But certainly, as you know, tax reform will help us get to those leverage profiles quick than we would have done otherwise and look forward to updating you on '19 when we get closer to it.

On Oath, do you still think you're going to be able to use wireless customer data in terms of location and usage to do more targeted advertising? And if so, kind of the timing on that? And then secondly, it does seem like wireless and wireline networks are converging.
Lowell, just curious, how do the unions kind of feel about this? Do you have the flexibility to kind of really converge these networks on a timely basis? Thank you.
","OK. Tim, thanks for the question, and I'd just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes. First on customer data. Our hallmark on this, Tim, is transparency.
We don't want to use data though I -- unless customers know how we're using it. And so far, we've been able to do broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data, but overall data. And I think that that anonymous usage, we're very clear with customers about, and it's certainly got a lot of value to the old facets. On the convergence side, we're honoring the contract within the footprint, and we're very open with the union about what we're doing and we're very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward.
So we're -- again, transparency is important to us. We think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any footfalls and we're open about it. We don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.
