Mario Corso,Dr. Joao Siffert,"Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the pain data, I feel like I’m hearing a little bit of mixed message. You used the word disappointing but I think the prior comments for the study was really designed to inform dosing for future studies and not necessarily expecting statistical significance for the study but again looking at correlation of blood levels and efficacy. And I’m wondering how you feel about that piece of it?
And it certainly sounds like there is the potential for future development here with pain. So I’m trying to reconcile some of those issues a little bit. And then secondarily, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross to net a jump in the fourth quarter and it looks a little bit higher for the full year ahead than it was in the prior year? Thanks very much.","This is Joao here. I’ll first address the question regarding the pain study. So we’d miss the primary efficacy end point which indeed was looking at the dose response as you mentioned. So that’s disappointing. The issue here is as we look to the overall development program is how to fit in the MS pain data which is smaller data set and on is specific type of pain, which is central neuropathic pain into the broader neuropathic pain development which focuses are primarily on peripheral neuropathic pain specifically in treatment resistant DPN pain.
So that’s the -- that sort of the work cut out for us to look at the data in this totality as we entertain the next steps in the pain development program. We will look at the -- but the data from this study and the positive data, unequivocally positive data in the DPN Phase III trial which was well powered to technical difference and we will consult both internally and also with our key pain experts who have advised the company over the years."

Thanks very much.","Hi. Mario, this is -- its Rohan. So breaking your question into two parts, the increase in the gross to net on this quarter, it was primarily driven because our Medicare part D expense specially the coverage gap which is known as the donut hole that increased significantly. Now in some ways, we were expecting this because as we continue to grow our Medicare business, the donut hole coverage with Pharma companies have to be able to continue to grow.
The reason you saw fluctuation quarter-to-quarter is we get billed once a quarter by CMS on a lagging period. And so it comes then in this time period because people tend to hit the donut hole in the third quarter and then typically by fourth quarter they go in to catastrophic coverage and then they start the year again, they are out of the donut hole.
So what you’ll start to see is we see quarterly variations between one quarter to the next. And then addressing the question about the growth in gross to net for fiscal ‘14, one thing I’d like to remind you is a significant part of our gross to net is really driven by wholesaler fees and mandatory rebates which we have to pay. In fact, it’s over 50%.
But the other reason you are seeing a slight increase versus our previous guidance is because of the new contracts we are signing with peers, which really helps access the increased amount of donut hole coverage which we expect as our Medicare business grows and the -- and the last one is the impact of the recent price increase we took. So that’s the reason it went up slightly for next year."
Roy Buchanan,Christine Ocampo,"Hi guys. It’s Roy in for Charles. Thanks for taking the questions. First one is a quick one, I just wonder, Christine, if you could restate the R&D guidance for next year?
","Yeah, I’ll be happy to. So our R&D expenses are expected to be between $40 million to $44 million.
"
,,Okay. Great. Thanks. And then other question is I wonder if you guys could walk through the best case and worst case scenarios for the litigation when we could see the first generics and what your plans are? Thanks.,"Sure. Hi Roy, it’s Keith. So in terms of best case which is the case that we fully expected to be the outcome, the judge will -- will issue a ruling from the bench and that ruling will be in favor of Avanir and allow us to continue the promotion of the NUEDEXTA and helping PBA patients through 2026. Worst case scenario would be that after the judge rules against us, in which case the drugs would be allowed to enter. So long if that really happens after the expiration of the 30-months stay which is on December 30th."

",I assume off course you guys would appeal?,"Absolutely. To the extent that we’re not successful, we would definitely appeal.

Ritu Baral ,"Dr. Joao Siffert
","Thanks for taking the question guys. Looking back, have you seen any sort of historical difference and placebo response rates in MS pain studies versus diabetic peripheral neuropathy studies?","I’ll take the question, Ritu, Joao here. There aren’t a lot of MS pain studies, at least not lot of well-controlled trials in MS pain. There is a lot more in DPN pain studies. So -- and placebo is a factor in all pain studies affecting all of CMS therapeutic areas pretty much including epilepsy more recently. So I can’t make a sort of statement one way or another, what’s known is in MS pain is it seems to be a harder hurdle. There is no approved drugs for that in the U.S. There is some -- other than OPS perhaps that have a broad pain indication. And if you look at the history of these clinical trials a lot of good drugs have failed in MS pain.
So it’s a tough field to crack. And so we again need to put this in context with the overall neuropathic pain program and the indications that ultimately we would like to pursue in a regulatory path."
Ritu Baral ,"Dr. Joao Siffert
","Got it. And what was your placebo assumption in this trial?
","The assumption, it’s usually -- we look at treatment difference, right, not necessarily placebo assumption. You want all this to say that the active will be over the placebo. So pretty standard, usually a point to two points you can consider a successful trial. But even -- if you look at even other trials recently published, some times the difference between drug and placebo is like less than a point. This is in now zero to 10-point scale.
So then depending if you can -- depending if you can power the study enough, you have to power for a relatively small difference especially in the more difficult types of pain trials like this one."
Ritu Baral ,Dr. Joao Siffert,Got it. And can you confirm that you did see separation if only numerical separation between the treatment benefit between the two groups?,"Again there was no difference. I mean, we can talk about numerical variations but in the end you have to have something that is either a very clear trend or a statistically significant difference and we do not see that. There was an improvement from baseline and all treatment arms and that makes the hurdle even higher because as you introduce whatever bias came into the study assessment that these patients will have chronic pain, all of them will have chronic pain, all of them had at least moderate-to-severe pain at study entry coming to your trial after 12 weeks then they show an improvement.
So something happened that they improved. The problem is whatever influence the outcome of the pain scores influenced this across the treatment arms. So that makes it harder to tease apart what is the drug effect versus whatever else is happening in the study that is generating this kind of response."
Ritu Baral ,Dr. Joao Siffert,"Got it and per the press release, you said that the change from baseline was -- the magnitude of change from baseline and benefit from baseline in the active group was around what you expected, is that correct?
","Yes, give or take is what we expected.
"
Ritu Baral ,Dr. Joao Siffert,"Okay. So therefore you wouldn’t think that the PK could play into it. I am just thinking about the fact that the quinidine dose and the formulations that you used in this study is different than the one used in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy trial a few years ago?
","Yes. So the dose range in the DPN trial was slightly higher than this dose range but there is some overlap of this trial too in the higher dose. So that may be a factor. I think a larger factor is looking at DPN versus central pain in MS. And also the factor that sometimes you run trials even with drugs that can work in the particular indication and sometimes the specific study just doesn’t work. So that is somewhat of a nature of what we do as well.
"
Ritu Baral ,Dr. Joao Siffert,"Got it. And the data that you have generated as far as benefit from baseline, will that -- will that have some -- would that help you in some way in potentially designing a future trial either in DPN or any other pain indication or would you have to sort of run another study to see what the treatment benefit might be for Phase III?
","No. This is all -- yes this is the part of the overall data set. Again the largest data set we have and the most powerful data set is from the DPN pain phase III trial that we published. So that’s the sort of core data set that will guide us in the next steps in the development. This is one input in to the broader data set we already have.
"
Thomas Wei,Rohan Palekar,"Thanks. I apologize I missed the very beginning of the call, but I just wanted to clarify. So you saw no dose response at all in the pain study, is it just kind of all scattered around the placebo arm?
","Yes. It was not all scattered but there was no statistical dose response -- their correlation wasn’t robust enough to reach statistical significance.
"
Thomas Wei,"Keith Katkin
","Okay. Can you just remind me, -- we are actually looking at the old DPN data earlier today, what -- why was that not pursued?","Yes, I can jump on that, Thomas. Thomas, it’s Keith. So originally when we had designed this program and focused on MS pain, it was a number of years ago before we had AVP-786. And at that time, we weren’t certain about what type of intellectual property we would have to be able to support a DPN pain indication that would -- give us the runway that we needed in order to fully develop it.
So, we decided to focus in on MS pain because we believe that there was a good possibility that we get orphan drug status and that we can build that into the overall development plan and time it accordingly. With the in-licensing of AVP-786 that obviously has changed our entire perspective and that’s how we spent a fair bit of time in our Investor Relations Day in October talking about we had already made up our mind that we were going to move towards -- back towards diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain because of 786.
So I think these study results just further validate that belief and that approach that we put out before. That said, we need to look at the totality of the data where we just got the study results. So we have to go through and see how it can inform the program but by no means do we think that this is the end of the pain program. We just think that we need to spend some time really going through all of the data."
Thomas Wei,"Keith Katkin
","And through the remaining three indications, when you also combine in major depressive disorder, which of those three do you think you have the strongest level of evidence from prior studies to support a positive outcome?
","So, there is -- probably I'll start from the backwards from the smaller study and then levodopa-induced dyskinesia, there’s published data with the DM&Q combination albeit at a higher dose but that’s published about what 10 years ago or so neurology. So that’s clinical prospective, clinical data.
We also have a -- case series reported on patients with dyskinesia or chorea, which is the type of dyskinesia and about I think 12 patients came out of Baylor College of Medicine recently, I think it was published last year, senior author is Bill Ondo and he reported majority of the patients had clinically meaningful improvement.
Chorea from various etiologies including Huntington, Parkinson’s, somebody had brain injury, very natal brain injury. But that again reinforces the data and movement disorders, so that’s pretty clear cut. In the agitation, as we mentioned we looked at -- in the PBA trials, some PBA patients also have some irritability and agitation as comorbid neuropsychiatric manifestations.
And we looked in the Star trial, which is a pivotal trial and there are two patients improved in the agitation domain of the neuropsychiatric inventory, so that’s prospectively done although it’s a post-hoc analysis, this analysis -- the assessments were done prospectively as part of the control study and it did reached significant difference from placebo and that Avanir dose related drug trend.
And, again, this is in the dose range of PBA. So, obviously for depression, we don’t not have a clinical trial in depression, but there is -- perhaps the strongest evidence here is this pharmacological in there to be binding sites for dextromethorphan or modulate classic neurotransmitter pathways that are known to working depression including serotonin and norepinephrine.
And most recently with the data in glutamate and even on sigma-1 as augmentation type strategies for anti-depressant treatment, these make this candidate of DMQ, in this case where we use 786, a likely drug for development. And we have obviously consulted with the experts in the field and we hear pretty clear endorsement for the next logical step in the development of 786 in this indication. So we feel pretty confident that there is a strong scientific rationale to pursue those. And this rationale is not altered by the outcome of the MS pain trial in anyway that I can see."

","Hi, this is actually Chris on for Jason. Just two questions. First, do you have any update from the judge and did extra trial at all possible timing of the ruling? And then secondly just wondering whether the results of this PRIME trial impact your thinking around the patent that expires in 2016? Thanks very much.
","Hey Chris, it’s Keith. Thanks for the questions. So, first, in terms of updates from the judge, no specific update from the judge. I think what we can do though, as we can look at his most recently ruling and his most recent ruling which was in regards to cadence taken about two months in order to issue that ruling. And if you look at historically, the amount of time it has taken them, it has taken them about three months. So if you follow the most recent precedent or average, you will be looking at about two to three months, I would like to put us anywhere from mid-January to mid-February.
That said, it is still quite possible we could issue the decision on or before December 30th to the extent that he doesn’t, then in the past, he has proactively issued in injunction preventing the launch of generics. And for some reason in this case, he did not then we would certainly petition the court for an injunction. So we are still feeling very good about the case. We are confident of the outcome and looking forward to the decision from the judge.
And then in regards to your second question about how PRIME may affect the 2006 patent, given we have just got this data very recently, we are still going through the data to understand what if any implications that may have on our IP position."
