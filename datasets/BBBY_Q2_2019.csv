Seth Basham,Robyn D’Elia,"Thanks a lot and good afternoon. My question is around the outlook for holidays. You guys are shifting a bunch of marketing dollars and promotional dollars to the holiday period. Can you first quantify how much you are shifting and how much you are adding? And secondly, what type of improvement you expect in both sales as well as margins over this period?","Sure. Thanks Seth. So as you’ve mentioned, we are shifting dollars into the back half for promotional and marketing support. Those dollars are being generated from ongoing transformation initiatives, as well as the benefits that Mary mentioned in our cost structure savings initiatives, and those dollars that we are planning to invest will be spent on promotional events during Thanksgiving week, through Cyber Monday, as well as driving enrollment in BEYOND+ and investing in new communication channels such as digital video and radio.In terms of quantifying it, we’ve built it all into the model and that the reinvestment of those dollars is allowing us to maintain our top line at around $11.4 billion, as well as maintain our bottom line within the previously guided range."
Seth Basham,Mary Winston,That’s helpful. And then I have a follow-up which relates to your inventory. You guys are quickly reducing your inventory to get to your goal of $1 billion reduction at retail. Should we expect any more markdowns or I should say write-downs to reach that goal over the next 18 months?,"This is Mary. No, I think we believe that where we are with the write-down we’re taking this quarter, it covers the full $1 billion of inventory. So now our work will just be to accelerate the process of actually getting it out of our stores."
Brad Thomas,Mary Winston,"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about some of the strategic review as you analyze some of the different business units and some of the assets that you may be able to sell, like some of the real estate. I guess, is there any ability to quantify for us the kinds of bids or interest level that may be out there and any more ability to talk about timing with which you might be able to address some of this?","Hi, this is Mary. Thanks for the question, Brad. I would say, at this point no, we’re not in a position to put specific numbers to you know the businesses and all that. I will say, we are very actively engaged in the process, and we’ve had a number of inbound interests on some of our portfolio companies, and so we’re taking a look at those, we are evaluating that, we’re going through the normal process that you would go through to do that, and so when we have something to report that actually turns into you know a potential transaction, we’ll certainly come forward with that. But at this point, not knowing you know how many things may go forward and all of that, it’s hard for us to put any number on it.And in terms of the other assets, the real estate, I think we talked about that from a square footage standpoint. You know it’s a combination of retail and non-retail real estate. So we’re looking at some inbounds there as well, and so we’ll have a sense of that, I would say in the next quarter or two as we move through that process."
Brad Thomas,Mary Winston,"That’s helpful, Mary. And if I could ask a follow-up around fundamentals, you’re clearly making some progress on gross margin, on expenses. But I guess as I look at same-store sales, a difficult first half of the year, can you talk a little about how you’re thinking about same-store sales progressing through the balance of the year and what you’ve been seeing so far in 3Q?","I’ll go first and then I’ll let Robyn go out. Just make a couple of quick comments. I think you’re right in your comments about what – the trends you’re currently seeing. It has been a rough first half of the year, and as we’ve said early on, we expect sales to start to stabilize and to see better trends in the back half of the year.For the full year we do still expect to be comping down though, and we’ve talked pretty extensively in the prepared remarks about all the initiatives that we have under way to help drive sales. I’ll let Robyn jump in and cover some of that."
Brad Thomas,Robyn D’Elia,"That’s helpful, Mary. And if I could ask a follow-up around fundamentals, you’re clearly making some progress on gross margin, on expenses. But I guess as I look at same-store sales, a difficult first half of the year, can you talk a little about how you’re thinking about same-store sales progressing through the balance of the year and what you’ve been seeing so far in 3Q?","So just to cover your comp – your question on how we’re performing third quarter to-date, we are still declining from a comp perspective, but at a lower rate than what we’ve experienced through the second quarter."
Bobby Griffin,Robyn D’Elia," Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I was first hoping to dive a little bit into the gross margin aspect. Can you maybe give us a little color by concept or maybe month-by-month the progress you’re making in improving the margin structure? And then basically the same question on the SG&A side too. If we can get some color around, you know month-over-month how it’s improved and where the bigger opportunities last are for the remainder of the year?","Sure. Just to address your point on breaking out the components by concept, that is not you know historically been our reporting cadence to break it out at that granular level, but from a gross margin perspective, you know we are pleased that this quarter, we have favorable trends, 20 basis points improvement, that is a significant shift from what we’ve been experiencing from a trending perspective, and it’s driven by benefits in coupons and net direct to customer shipping with some offset in merchandise margins.But that merchandise margin, which I’m talking about on a consolidated basis, the trend in that has been improving due to some of the ongoing initiatives that we have in place. So for some select products, we’ve actually moved to direct importing and gained efficiencies from our own supply chain, which has benefited us. We’ve also been actively engaging in vendor negotiations around our merchandise, and then we’ve also continued with some strategic pricing initiatives which has helped benefit our margin, and we have more to come."
Bobby Griffin,Robyn D’Elia,"I guess I was maybe looking on the 20 basis points for the quarter. Did it exit the quarter at a stronger rate than that, where we can see that it’s improving at a faster rate and we’re on pace for greater than 20 exiting the quarter? I guess just on a consolidated basis is what I was asking.","Yes, I guess the way I’m doing is quarter-to-quarter, I mean last quarter we were down 50 basis points. It was unfavorable and now we’ve trended positively this quarter by 20. So we are moving in a positive momentum."
Bobby Griffin,Robyn D’Elia,"Okay. And then on the store closures, can you just tell us about the timing of the 60, all weighted in the fourth quarter, how should we spread them out in our model?","They are weighted toward the fourth quarter, which is the typical timing of when we negotiate our leases."
Sarah Clark,Mary Winston,"Hi, this is Sarah Clark on for Carla Casella. I was just wondering if you would consider buying back bonds in the market, and if you have any update on target leverage figure?","We don’t have an update at this point on our target leverage figure. We are actively discussing with the Board, our overall capital allocation approach, and so we will be you know sorting that out relatively soon. As you know, we have a number of moving pieces.I think right now our capital allocation priorities continue to be what they have been given the amount of transformation effort that we have under way, certainly investing back in the business to drive those initiatives and get sales moving in the right direction and improve the business performance is the top priority.But we’re also looking at the other ways to return funds to shareholders. So continuing our dividend program, the share buybacks that Robyn spoke about and buying back our debt is on the list as well. So that will be a consideration as well."
Simeon Gutman,Mary Winston,"Hi, good afternoon. My first question is back on some of the inventory and the destocking. I know you said an 18 month process. Can you tell us maybe what innings has it been from, I guess from a store perspective and the impact that it’s having at the customer shops. Can you give us some sense? Are you seeing a basket size change? Are you seeing conversion then go up online if they are not finding something in the store? And then I have one follow-up on the gross margin.","From a timing perspective, in the short term, we are planning to have about $350 million of the inventory out of the stores before holiday. We are in the early innings of starting that process and of removing the inventory from the physical store locations. As we are working through that, we’re mindful not to cannibalize sales during this holiday period."
Simeon Gutman,Mary Winston,"Okay. I guess the follow-up on the gross margin, and I apologize because I wasn’t on the beginning part of the call. So, you took I guess this write-down now and you’re suggesting we add it back and now you are starting to clear out some of this inventory. And so can you just talk about some of the mechanics of this on the gross margin, how we should think about it?","Sure. So for the quarter we took a charge of $194 million. As that inventory clears through, any markdowns associated with that inventory has already been taken from a P&L perspective. But we also have inventory that we’ve been focused on from an assortment optimization perspective included in this write-down that we’ll have to work through the process over time, which will take us about 18 months or up to 18 months to clear through that merchandise and be able to present a crisper, fresher point of view from a customer perspective."
Atul Maheswari,Mary Winston,"Good afternoon. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. So it seems like a digital growth took a step down this quarter. What drove this deceleration and what plans do you have to reaccelerate online sales? And then along those lines, what have you been seeing for digital growth in the back half of the year?","Okay, this is Mary. I’ll take the first part of your question about our digital business, so your observation is correct. We were slightly down on that business this quarter and I would say the biggest impact is somewhat self-inflicted. We’re still suffering the ramifications of decisions that were made earlier where we were focused on profitability at the expense of sales. So for the online business, we did things like eliminate some of the SKUs online because of their level of profitability. We put a minimum order quantity on some of the online sales. We increased our free shipping threshold.So collectively, all of those things have put pressure on that business. What we’re trying to do about that is we’re reversing many of those decisions. Again, our top priority now is to focus on sales, and to manage the cost line through all the other initiatives that we’ve talked about, and so we are reinvesting in our online, we’re investing in improvements in our search and recommendation capabilities on the website. We’re streamlining the checkout process. We’re about to be rolling out our BOPIS, Buy Online, Pickup In Store.So we’re doing a number of things to change the tide and change the direction of that and we’ll start to move that in the right direction."
Atul Maheswari,Robyn D’Elia,"So, basically, what have you baked in for digital growth in the back half of the year?","So in terms of the back half, to get to the range of around $11.4 billion, it does imply that there’s less negative, I guess less negative comps from a back half perspective. But we don’t break that out by channel explicitly."
Jonathan Matuszewski,Mary Winston,"Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just to follow up on e-com, you alluded to closing down one of your least productive digital businesses. So maybe just give us some more color there in terms of timing, rationale and impact of sales and profitability, and then I had just a quick follow-up.","Okay, on that particular business, the timing is the end of this month. It is one of our smallest businesses. So the impact on the financial performance overall is immaterial. It’s a business that specializes in selling specialized and unique fashion and home products. And again, it’s one of our smallest e-commerce businesses."
Jonathan Matuszewski,Robyn D’Elia,"Okay, great. And then just a follow-up question on 4Q. So, you know based on the revised annual guide, looks like we’d be looking for around three quarters of annual earnings coming in 4Q and that’s a bit above kind of what’s been earned in recent years.So could you just confirm, is it the new promotional framework during the holiday season that you think is going to be driving the earnings growth? And then just clarify whether that implied 4Q guide includes things like potential sale leaseback proceeds? Thank you.","So we do have a significant amount of earnings included in the fourth quarter; one, due to the timing shift of the holiday period. So, the third quarter this year ends on the Saturday right after Thanksgiving, whereas last year it had included Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the full week following that. So that’s one item that the fourth quarter now picked up that initial week following Thanksgiving.Additionally, with the incremental marketing and promotional spend that we’re adding for the year, if you may recall that from the accounting rules, once you send an event out, you immediately have to expense that event in full, even though the benefits of that event may spread over a period of time. And so it will impact third quarter more heavily and benefit fourth quarter, because they’ll have some sale spill over into that period.I’m sorry, as far as considering the proceeds from sale leasebacks that does not contemplate in the model."
Oliver Wintermantel,Mary Winston,"Yes, thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify, when you said that the inventory fell-through, that should not have a gross margin impact throughout the rest of the year, so I just want to clarify that. And then my other question on gross margins is like the shipping costs seem to be a benefit in the second quarter. So was that driven by lower sales and that’s why shipping costs were better?And then now looking into the back end of the year, if you expect that your sales are going to improve throughout the year and the BEYOND+ membership promotions that you have during the holiday season, should we expect gross margins to be down because of shipping costs or should that have a negative impact? Thank you.","So that was a multi-part question. I’m going to start with the first one, and I may have to ask you to repeat a couple of your sub-bullet points. So, on the inventory you’re asking about the margin impact as we take out the merchandise.Again, we’re mindful not to cannibalize sales, you know during the holiday period and we can, using a third-party liquidator, remove that merchandise from our stores, but not have it out in the market competing, you know competing against ourselves or be liquidating it in a heavy fashion during this time frame.And then I think you asked about shipping expense. Yes, we’ve seen shipping as a favorable driver as a percent of sales benefiting gross margin this quarter and I’m sorry, if you could repeat your next question."
Oliver Wintermantel,Mary Winston,"Yeah, the question was just with your improving sales in the back end of the year and the BEYOND+ membership promotions. Should we expect then gross margins to be negatively impacted because of shipping costs in the second half?","Assuming a significant ramp up in BEYOND+, yes we’ve been calling out how that’s impacted margin, because they do have free shipping associated with increased enrollment, but they also spend more frequently and spend heavier when they are buying from us than the average customer."
Curtis Nagle,Mary Winston," Great! Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just a little bit more detail on the progress of the CEO search process. How many candidates you are down to? What does soon mean? And are you still within ""weeks"" as you guys have laid out in your shareholder letter?","So to answer the last part of your question first, yes, we are definitely down to the final weeks. I’m not going to get into the details of the number of candidates, but you know we have been very actively focused on the search. We’ve got a great search firm working with us. We’ve had great interest in the position. So we’ve had quite a number of strong candidates.As I think we had mentioned before, we’re looking for somebody with you know retail transformation experience, innovation, online and digital experience, marketing experience. So we’re looking for all of the things that we would need to really continue the transformation of the business and we feel good about where we are in the process. And so you know, we expect to be naming a permanent CEO soon."
Curtis Nagle,Mary Winston,"Okay, fair enough. And then just in terms of 3Q, thinking about the timing and the calendar shift and when holidays hit, is that going to impact how you guys report comps or is that going to be adjusted for?","Our comps will be based on the same period in the prior year, so we wouldn’t adjust for it."
Zach Fadem,Mary Winston,"Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Again, on the gross margin, you mentioned the ramp in BEYOND+. But I believe you said the coupon had a less negative impact from fewer redemptions. So curious if you could speak to that in a little more detail, whether the lower coupon usage was self-inflicted and how we should think about the coupon going forward as its impact to sales and gross margin?","Sure, so coupon, the decrease in the redemptions of coupons was, I would say, not self-inflicted. We had as many coupons distributed this quarter, you know this year versus last year and we will continue to issue coupons to customers, you know who utilize them and who want them when they are shopping with us."
Zach Fadem,Mary Winston,"Okay, understood. And then on the store manager incentives, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the metrics you’ll be tracking and rewarding and when you were evaluating whether to move forward with this plan, curious to hear whether you piloted the program in any of your stores and maybe you could talk about your findings there and any sales or margin lift per store that we should anticipate?","So we don’t have those details quite handy, and no, we did not pilot it separately, and this is basically a one-time program that’s targeted toward you know driving sales over the holiday period. This is a really critical period for us. We’re doing a lot of things to bring people into the stores and so we also want to incentivize our sales managers to be thinking about selling and driving sales as they are in the stores.And it’s also good for morale in a, you know time of change in the stores and sales comping down up to this point. So it will give them the opportunity to participate in driving incremental sales."
Daniel Hofkin,Mary Winston,"Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick question about general fundamentals and then a quick - just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. So you talked about efforts to drive more sales in the back half into the holidays. Can you just talk about what sort of impact you expect on profit margins or profitability from that and how that could kind of build over time, you know obviously driving top line is important, but you know in terms of the trade-out between sales and margins, and then like I said, I have a couple of quick housekeeping questions after that.","So, let me just start and then I’m going to turn it over to Robyn to maybe talk at a little bit more detailed level. But even as we said in the fourth quarter, we are focused on driving – I mean, in the first quarter call, we’re focused on driving top line, but we’re focused on maintaining profitability as well.So we believe given the number of levers we have to pull and the number of opportunities we have in the business that we can drive sales and we may be on promotion of course through the holiday season and doing more advertising. But we think we have other levers to pull to control the cost structure, to maintain profitability."
Daniel Hofkin,Robyn D’Elia,"Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick question about general fundamentals and then a quick - just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. So you talked about efforts to drive more sales in the back half into the holidays. Can you just talk about what sort of impact you expect on profit margins or profitability from that and how that could kind of build over time, you know obviously driving top line is important, but you know in terms of the trade-out between sales and margins, and then like I said, I have a couple of quick housekeeping questions after that.",And considering that and the sales stabilization initiatives that we have is what led us to maintaining our guidance of the sales around $11.4 billion and then EPS between $2.08 and $2.13.
Daniel Hofkin,Robyn D’Elia,"Okay, thanks. And then I guess just a couple of things, a couple adjustments you guys have made I guess in this release and then a prior quarter or two. You took a, what looks like a sizable reduction in your sales return liability you know in the last couple of quarters relative to last year, like more than 200 basis points by your math, as a percentage of sales. I was just wondering what would have driven that, and you know that large reduction? And then my other question is just on the size of the inventory adjustment this quarter in terms of like adding it all back to adjusted earnings.","So, from a sales return perspective, that reserve is definitely impacted by the seasonality of our business. And so if sales you know are coming down, depending on the time of the year that we’re in, we’re certainly going to see reductions in that reserve.In addition, we made some changes to our returns policy, which over time we would assume that the sales returns would be fewer than what we’ve had experienced in the past. However, we don’t know if we’ve compromised sales by some of those changes initially from a customer-facing perspective.But again, over time, the sales return policy would impact it, if you have a specific quarter detailed dollars, we could certainly have a follow-up call to walk through the mechanics of what you’re seeing."
Daniel Hofkin,Mary Winston,"Yes, just about the inventory adjustment. I mean I understand conceptually, but it kind of seems like, you know the inventory presumably was, you know either in hindsight you over paid for it or market conditions or whatever kind of competitive conditions changed.Just wondering why it would be – why you guys would add back, you know kind of that full charge within this quarter as opposed to you know just part of it or apply it against historical earnings over the period where it would have lost value?","Well, this inventory write-down is tied to our strategic initiatives. It’s flagging inventory that we see as aged inventory or duplicative fuse in our assortment. So we’ve been actively working on identifying nodes to put it in use and wanting to move them out of our assortment again, so that we can present a clearer point of view from an inventory and merchandising perspective to our customers. So we view this as tied to transformation."
