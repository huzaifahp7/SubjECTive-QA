","This is Ryan MacDonald in for Mike Latimore. I guess just starting out, so it was real great to see ARPU increase there for the quarter. And I was just wondering, is this something that you think you can expect for fourth quarter as well, another increase? Or are you thinking more that ARPU will stabilize along at these levels?
","Well, we expect that over the ensuing months and quarters, Ryan, that we should see a ramp up in increase in average revenue per unit. In terms of fourth quarter, it will probably stabilize to maybe slightly higher, but we'll have to wait until -- to see. Right now, we have a lot of visibility in the fourth quarter and it looks very good. But you can see the -- if you divide the subscription revenues through by the number of subs, you'll come over the calculation slightly higher than what we produced in Q2.

","Okay. And then also, I guess, it's been asked, talking about more about these managed service deals and how those will bring in higher ARPU. I mean, you obviously announced John Deere during the quarter, but what's the pipeline look for the managed services beyond John Deere? And when do you think you might be -- when do you think you might be able to announce another deal and then start seeing more revenue from it?","Well, we don't know when we'll be able to announce it, but we have been approved on a couple already. One very significant one, one that I referred to in the -- during the January, February time frame when we raised money. So that one's -- that went through an RP process and we've been given the green light there. And then we have 2 more we're working on. They're also very substantial deals. They will have very little, if any, impact this year, as I've said many times over but will be contributors in the next year, '14 and beyond. Very pleased with that progress. And overall, the opportunity funnel looks very solid, very robust.

","This is Matt Ramsay on for Mike. A couple of questions from us. When you step back and look at the business and the investments that you've made, it sounds like the managed services deals should ramp ARPU over the next year or so. How would you characterize sort of the size of those opportunities in aggregate that we should see over the next 12 months or so? Obviously your sub base now is going to be approaching 2.5 million. What kept the sub base to look like, say, 12, 18 months from now from a percentage of the subs that are sort of the traditional ones that you've had up until now versus these managed services deals that could be materially higher ARPU?","Well, the -- we'll give our guidance for next year in our February call following the end of the year. But we expect that the ramp in these high ARPU subscription will be a significant contributor next year. Keeping in mind that if you look at our average, and it's about $2, many of these solutions carry ARPU with them several times that average. So we think it'll have a very meaningful impact on the recurring revenue that comes from our subscription base. So we expect to continue growing our base at a robust pace, and we'll also give some visibility into the dichotomy between the traditional horizontal platform business and the -- these solutions. So -- but we're still computing, so we'll figure out the guidance that we'll provide next year. But it looks very positive right now.

Matthew D. Ramsay,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","All right, fair enough. And then, if I want to back up and just ask sort of one more higher-level question from an industry perspective, it's a pretty dynamic space obviously with consolidation and M&A and different strategies going on in all different parts of the M2M ecosystem. You've seen some of the hardware and module suppliers now looking to offer connectivity in managed services as part of their offering and also some deals get done in the satellite space even as recent as or a common intersat [ph] in the last few days. How are you seeing the overall competitive environment for services like yours? And even as your business transitions to that, do you think that your new strategy is sort of positioned in that dynamic landscape?
","Well, we think the new strategy positions us exceptionally well. Having said that, even our horizontal platform business has been doing very well, growing at 20% plus and our subscription base ramping up each year, year in year out for -- than the last several years. So we feel very well-positioned with our platform strategy, our horizontal strategy, including network and application services, including these 3, we call underserved broadly defined vertical markets. We feel very well-positioned. And these strategic alignments will continue to happen, consolidations will continue to happen, but we are focused on our strategy and, hopefully, we stay ahead of the competition."
Matthew D. Ramsay,"Richard A. Flynt

","All right. I'll just sneak one more and if I could. Rick, you guys, talked in your prepared remarks about OpEx being flat or slightly up sequentially. Is that on an absolute basis or a percentage of revenue? Because it looks like revenue might be down a bit from the midpoint of your guidance.",That's on an absolute basis.
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","Question on your subscriber growth for the year. Understanding you're kind of 31% year-to-date, but your comp is much tougher in the fourth quarter of last year. So to get to that 30% for the year, you need to see a pretty dramatic acceleration or increase in the fourth quarter of '13. Just wondering how you're thinking about the subscriber additions in the fourth quarter of '13? And if you still think that 30% number is the right number for the full year?","Rich, we're still affirming our guidance for the year. I mean, the visibility we have into the fourth quarter so far looks promising. So 30% -- we're 31% now, 30% is probably a very reasonable number to hang your hat on, so to speak, for the full year. And the mix -- but what I've said in our comments is the mix over the course of ensuing quarters, that will change with higher ARPU. So you'll see the gap close between the growth rate in the subscription -- in the revenue, rather, and the recurring revenue and the subscription growth, both of which we expect to be very robust next year."
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","Okay. And then just further question I got on the for 4Q outlook, trying to understand that the breakdown between the subscription and hardware. You gave the guidance on the full year hardware and if I took that to just kind of the 8% level for the year, filling the fourth quarter there, it would seem to imply flattish subscription revenue from 3Q to 4Q, which doesn't seem particularly logical. So just wondering, do you expect to see a sequential increase in your subscription revenue in 4Q versus 3Q?","Yes, we definitely do. And we expect that increase in service revenues, and we also expect a -- clearly, an increase in year-over-year increase in hardware revenue. So we just gave you as much guidance as we could. The 8% growth from the hardware puts us at, I think, a low -- probably a slightly lower level but, again, we did say that we've conservative guidance on hardware. Because of it's sporadic nature, Rich, we just -- we don't like to give guidance on hardware because that's tough to...
"
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","Yes, yes, understood. I'm just trying to make it work with the $20 million midpoint. And if you put sort of $7 million-ish of hardware in there to get you to that 8%-ish, it doesn't -- not a ton of sequential growth in subscription, but I got you. Okay, but...","Yes, Rich, if we get this out, I think right now, the -- it's -- the lower end is 6%, right, not 7%. If it's 8%, it should be -- it should come around 6%. Maybe we didn't do our math right, but it should be 6%...

"
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","Okay. That's where I was at. Yes, I was getting a different number there, so maybe we're just -- I'm on a different base or something.

","No. But our -- we are expecting clearly an increase in recurring service revenue and support Q4 over Q3.

","This is Ross Licero on for Mike. I had a question on the hardware side of it. Did you say you were expecting low double-digit gross margins for the year?
",Yes

","This is Ross Licero on for Mike. I had a question on the hardware side of it. Did you say you were expecting low double-digit gross margins for the year?
",Yes
Ross Licero,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","So in order to get to that, you have to have 20-plus gross margins in the fourth quarter given the midpoint of the hardware revenue. Is that sort of where we should be?","No, we -- I think we're not expecting hardware revenue to be that high in the fourth quarter. Margins, rather, on hardware to be that high in the fourth quarter. But I don't think we need that number to get there. It's -- we just -- with the fourth quarter, with what we see in the hardware revenues and the margin produced, it should be higher. We're expecting a, maybe, a slightly improved margin. We said, at least, maintain our current margins in Q3 margins in Q4, but we could certainly see that increase. But we don't think it'll increase to that degree.

"
Ross Licero,"Richard A. Flynt

","So in order to get to that, you have to have 20-plus gross margins in the fourth quarter given the midpoint of the hardware revenue. Is that sort of where we should be?","Yes. And I think that's exactly right, Stratton. Yes."
Ross Licero,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","Okay. And can you give us a little more color around the -- where the new subscriptions are coming from during the quarter?

","Sure. We -- well, a number of them came from some of the managed services platforms and solutions that we launched earlier in the year. And then it's a very broad-based growth from anywhere from fleet, including security. We had a number of new applications come into play, including things like bin monitoring, tank monitoring applications and just pretty broad-based growth from a number of critical markets. But what we're looking for in the ensuing quarters and months -- months, I should say, and quarters is a significant ramp up in these high ARPU managed services subscriptions.
"
Ross Licero,"Richard A. Flynt

","Okay. And can you give us a little more color around the -- where the new subscriptions are coming from during the quarter?

","Ross, I just want to circle back on the hardware. When we say low double digits, it's excluding that $600,000 adjustment we had in Q2. So we're talking about kind of a normalized low double-digit average for the year.

"
Richard Valera,"Richard A. Flynt

",Just wanted a clarification on that kind of expense-free classification you did on the COGS line for subscription and support. What exactly was that? And I guess that sounds like it's something you're going to continue to classify that way going forward?,"It is, Rich. When we internally did some organizational structure changes, we identified the people that were actually moving into -- out of the cost of services area into -- not G&A but more like sales and marketing and the E&D and spending the majority of their time in those areas. And so we reclassified those in our cost beginning July 1 and that's the way it will be going forward.

","And what would the gross margin have been x that change? I'm sorry, is it 56 point...","It would have been 56.0%.
"
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
","And what would the gross margin have been x that change? I'm sorry, is it 56 point...","And that was -- but even with that, Rich, it was an improvement of, I think, 140 basis points over the comparable quarter."
Richard Valera,"Richard A. Flynt

",Sure. And with this new classification should -- where would we expect gross margins for service in the fourth quarter? At comparable levels to 3Q?,"Comparable are up. I think that's where you should expect them to be.
"
Richard Valera,"Stratton J. Nicolaides
",So 58% or better?,"Yes, we reported -- what we reported with the adjustment [indiscernible] or higher. Yes.
