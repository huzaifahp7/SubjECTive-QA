# SubjECTive-QA

A number of datasets for sentiment classification and stock price forecasting have been created using Earnings Call Transcripts, additionally aiding downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, numerical claim detection and hawkish-dovish-neutral sentiment classification. However, none these datasets focus on the multiple dimensions of answers given during the QA sessions of Earnings Calls. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{SubjECTive-QA}, the first annotated dataset of answers given during earnings calls. We will also provide an empirical evaluation with various state-of-the-art Pre-trained Language Models as benchmarks for the tone classification task and highlight the limitations posed by our dataset. Our dataset will be strategically designed to forecast headwinds or tailwinds for organizations.
