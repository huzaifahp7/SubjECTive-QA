","And I think our TripAdvisor and the third-party revenue, we're pretty neutral as to whether the revenue is third party or intercompany. I would say if you look at TripAdvisor's patterns, really, TripAdvisor and Expedia-Hotel point-of-sale support each other in that as TripAdvisor gets into a new country, it has automatically launch partners with Expedia and hotels.com, Hotwire to the extent. Well, Hotwire not internationally. But automatically, it has Expedia and hotels.com as launch partners, which helps TripAdvisor monetize immediately and then allow TripAdvisor to spend marketing money to grow that point-of-sale, so to speak. With time, then TripAdvisor goes out and acquires domestic players to play in the TripAdvisor marketplace and to increase the marketplace. So the average number of OTAs that TripAdvisor works with typically increases as we establish a new TripAdvisor point-of-sale. So that's where you're seeing the third-party revenue growth very quickly. It's growing internationally very quickly. We're accelerating the pace of new TripAdvisor sites on an international basis, and those revenues are growing at triple-digit growth rates along with collect [ph] and a lot of that is third-party revenue after kind of anchor clients come in, which is Expedia and hotels.com. So I think Trip runs a fair game, and they take all takers. And as long as quick growth grows as fast as it is, it is and will continue to be a perfect business for us.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

","So on FX, we were absolutely hurt on a year-on-year basis as foreign currencies were weaker on a year-on-year basis. As Q3 progressed and now into Q4, we've seen a strengthening of FX rates, but they still are below where they were last year. So we will have another headwind in Q4 as well. So when we are looking at our figures, we're basically using current rates and projecting them through the rest of the quarter.

And in that regard of moving into other indications, I imagine, Chip, this is going to be part of discussion when you review the strategic review of all the programs. I mean if you're talking about a strategic review, like I said of all the programs, you could -- what the spectrum of outcome could be keeping everything going as it is versus changing everything that's going on. Can you talk a little bit more about what the criteria might be for the strategic review? I know you probably won't be able to say very much more about it.
","Sure, I mean, it's exactly what you would expect.

We're looking at the numbers in detail and trying to dial it in. Part of it has to do quite simply with the burn-off of the – or the collection process around the sales and the burn-off of the inventory that we had earlier on in the year. I'm sure you can appreciate the fact that the averages look nice and easy, but down at the location level, it's a bit more challenging to see where's the wood, where are the receivables, and at what pricing, and then how are we burning it off. It's our best estimate. We're clearly going to shoot for more than that, but I think that $170 million is the right number for the guidance. But in light of that, we are still going to be below the 3.5 times levered number. That's a commitment that we are committed to and that we're looking forward to delivering on as sort of the final chapter in the ProBuild acquisition story.

Because if we go back to 2011 and compare the revenues, circulation revenue to that period for the first 3 months -- 3 quarters of this year, then you're just slightly ahead of what you were doing then. And if I remember correctly, you'd guided us to an operating margin of about 50% in that business. So the revenues are just slightly ahead. Then just from a -- just mathematically, the margins can only be higher than $100 million if the operating margins are a lot higher than 50%.
","And that was the rate -- that was the target, the metric that was put out at the time we had launched the all-access content subscription model in the spring of the prior year.

","Okay. I think what you're looking at is our total circulation revenue, which would include USA TODAY, Newsquest as well as U.S. Community Publishing. Well, obviously we have the benefit of knowing those numbers as they pertain to each one of those businesses. And we have been scrupulous in viewing those numbers. And if you look at where they are, there's several components you have to look at when you simply look at the 78 markets within U.S. Community Publishing that had the benefit of the all-access content subscription model. So you start with gross revenues, then you have to take that down for additional marketing, additional other things that we do.

Yes, that's helpful. And then just the restaurant margin was down, obviously, a couple hundred points this quarter with the two comps. So -- and it looks like it's going to be down, based on your guidance, another 150 on a -- on a softer comp. So, how do you keep margin flat with a 3% comp?","Well, we think with the 3% comp and you start to come back and take out some of the initiatives that we rolled through, it's probably going to be a little bit of a challenge from that standpoint, I think, as you look at it. But I think there's some efficiencies that we can go after. I also believe, as we look at this, some of it is transitory, you know, avocados are starting to come back in line from that standpoint. So, we would probably pick up the basis points there. We've got the basis points in some of the investments that we're rolling out in labor that's started to help us.And then, as always, we're going to go after that operating occupancy line and make sure there's areas that we can get more efficient at in our business. I think there's a challenge -- we think -- Chris, real quick, the challenge we face, frankly, and I try to make this clear short-term, is Q3 is just our lowest weekly sales average quarter and that with, you pay some utility rates, we start to pay for the NFL package in our restaurants. There's just little things that kind of hit us in Q3 but I think when we look at our business longer-term, we like where we are, we like the menu, variety that we have, the fact that we can have value on one side and we can have higher priced items or center plate entrees on other, but that will allow us to drive sales, drive check average and provide a great guest experience that frankly will allow us to drive margins.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

KLAC,Q4,2014," And then I guess, just a big-picture question for Rick. Rick, I've been covering KLA for like 16 years and KLA never used to miss on any number. They never used to miss guidance, very predictable results, operate with a lot of backlog. And now every quarter it seems like we're guiding below or margins are whipping around a lot, yet you still have about the same amount of backlog that you've always had. So I was just wondering if you can sort of wax poetic a little bit about maybe what's different about the company today because it seems like it's becoming a lot less predictable and a lot less operating with a lot of backlog as it used to, and I'm just not sure why?"," Yes, great question. I think -- 2 thoughts, and I'll let Bren weigh in on part of this answer. It's interesting if you look back in the last 4 or 5 years. The predictability year-on-year has actually never been higher. Our ability, when we go back and look at our plans for our calendar year, our internal plans, fiscal year-on-year, it's actually pretty close to what happened. The volatility has dramatically increased on a quarter-by-quarter basis, however. And I think it speaks a little bit to what's going on in terms of fewer customers, fewer units, larger ASPs. And the backlog is partly affected by our customers not needing to take things early or not wanting to take things early but not wanting to have them late. So they want all the equipment to come in at the same time kind of to Bren's comment earlier, when they're looking at a ramp, they want to front-load it with process control. But when something moves out as it did in the September quarter, the guys that want to move in, did -- it's not a plug-and-play in terms of being able to fill in that revenue. So I think the backlog is still very solid, it's just not as fungible in terms of short term as it was. Bren, if you want to add anything to that.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

It used to be consistently around 6 months. And over the last few years, it's come down between 4 and 5. There is a bit of a pop in June but it's related to some long lead-time business that we booked. I think that's a little bit of an anomaly compared to what we've seen where we're generally booking in one quarter and shipping a fair amount in the next quarter. So that has changed a fair amount. And to Rick's point, it's not necessarily fungible customer-by-customer, and the timing is a factor in terms of when they need the equipment. So as a result of that, we are reacting I think much faster to the bookings number or really the shipment number, I think, in terms of where the P&L is. And so to the extent that there's predictability quarter-on-quarter in shipments, then that enables us, I think, to drive a little bit more predictability in the P&L. But it does react much faster, and in the past, we had more backlog to, I guess, absorb or cushion some of those swings, one direction or the other.

HPE,Q4,2017," And then just secondly and separately, you had commented on DRAM prices being up another 5% or 10% this quarter. I am wondering, a) if you can comment on why that doesn’t make you less confident about your ability to hit margin targets and, b) whether you can comment on whether the competitive pricing environment has improved at all? Quite frankly, I was looking for more in terms of sequential margin improvement in the enterprise group, especially giving all the cost-cutting you are doing. And I am wondering if you gave some of that back, because of DRAM and competition?"," Yes, I would say the margin expansion if you look at Q4 the 10.6 was up 130 basis points. So, we were to continue to improve margins primarily driven by the $200 million to $300 million cost actions that we talked about in Q2 of ‘17. What gives us confidence despite DRAM is up another 5% to 10% in Q4. As we look forward into 2018, we still have a lot of tailwinds, right. We talked about it at SAM. So if you look at HPE Next that $250 million of net savings we are on track to do that now. I will say that is roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year. So as you think about quarterly splits and margins I would take that into account, but we feel very good about what’s going on there we continue to right size the cost envelopes of the recent acquisitions that we’ve done those will become more, more accretive as we go through 2018. So we have a lot of things that we think will continue to improve margins and we still feel based on what everything you see today, we feel good about 11% or 12%.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And I am wondering if you gave some of that back, because of DRAM and competition?","The other thing I’d add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin. And we anticipate that that will happen as we realign the sales force, as we focus marketing on the value and growth segment and we realize the potential of – of the portfolio. I would say the competitive pricing environment is maybe slightly mitigated, but it would be hard for me to gauge that, because it varies by country, it varies by product line and it shifts from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So while I would say overall, there’s been some mitigation in that pricing environment I would not say it is universal and we’re not counting on that for the delivery of our operating margin in 2018. And then DRAM pricing appears to now be leveling out and you talk to people in the industry, it appears that supply is now beginning to match demand there is going to be more supply I think from the key vendors of memory and so we’ll see what happens. We are not counting by the way on to deliver our results on a drop in DRAM pricing, we’re also not counting on another 15%, 20% increase in DRAM pricing, but we feel pretty good about the way where we are and I got a lot of confidence that we are going to hit our $1.15 to $1.20 and the 11% to 12% operating margin.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

RHT,Q3,2013," Charlie, if you could talk about what is happening from a payment standpoint, are customers at the margins, saying that they want to be invoiced for a shorter duration upfront. If it's just a tactical function of what happened to the sequester in the government vertical, if you could you just expand on that. And also, if you saw the change in invoicing happened just in one vertical or was it more broad-based? And I also wanted to clarify that your guidance is on a reported basis looking out and not on a constant currency basis?"," Okay, thanks, Kash. So I think a number of people may have questions about the backlog. And so just to clarify again the basics. When we get a booking, if we bill it, it goes into the deferred revenue. If it's going to target revenue within 12 months, it's current deferred revenue. If it's longer than 12 months and it's billed upfront, it's in long-term deferred revenue. If we have a 3-year deal that bills 1 year at a time and only the first year is billed, then the first year goes in deferred revenue and the balance would go into unbilled backlog. So this unbilled backlog number is important. It's directly connected this quarter to the significant increase in the large deals. As Jim mentioned, we had 3 deals over $10 million, 6 deals over $5 million and a substantial number of deals even beyond the top 30 that were over $1 million. These deals, which are done through the direct sales force, typically are going to have a shorter billing duration. So part of it is that, part of it is the channel mix, deals that are done through the channel are always billed upfront. The second question, Kash, about verticals, there was nothing unusual about the vertical mix in terms of payment terms. There was also nothing unusual about payment terms in smaller deals. It was all focused on really good news in some big deals. And the third part of your question about guidance for next year and foreign exchange, I'm guiding -- my guidance is based upon the foreign exchange rates that I've given as an assumption, which was $1.29 for the euro, which is unchanged year-to-year, and JPY 94 for the yen, which is a 15% weakening of the yen year-to-year. And those are just the 2 major currencies, we do business in probably more than 20 or more currencies.

LAKE,Q2,2016," Congratulations to all, everybody at Lakeland, it’s an absolute beautiful report. Could you talk some about your – the organic growth plan that you have for the emergency situations?"," Well, the organic is really, apart from the emergency what we’ve done is, we’ve set up a special system to be able to respond to emergency situation and it’s an inventory system that works with the end-user clients and/or the distributors. And it’s something that we might actually even patent, as a utility patent. But what we’re doing is, we’re setting up a, to be ready to respond to emergency situations with special inventory payment plans for customers, and that’s that one situation. The other part of the platform is the fact that we make the garments ourselves. We don’t contract it out like the rest of the guys do. And therefore, we make the better garment we believe. Organic growth is what I really wanted to get into, because this has been a – we never saw a lot of emergency situation business, we just didn’t. So most of the growth you saw from us was organic growth. And what I’m saying is that is still continuing. Over the years, I’ve told people that we lost about $80 million worth of DuPont type product sales between 2006 and 2010, but we replaced them all. I mean, we were losing $10 million dollars a year of DuPont Tyvek sales, because DuPont was in competition with us. And we replaced those $10 million of sales or almost $80 million of sales between 2006 and today. So if you look at the compound annual growth rate of what I would call our organic sales, okay, it was 17% a year. And now that we’re out, we’re no longer selling DuPont products, that we no longer have that millstone around all our neck called Brazil where we lost $34 million inside of three years, now people will begin to see both the internal or the organic growth at double-digits and they’ll see the emergency stuff and they’ll see more of it, because we are now the go-to manufacturer.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

NVDA,Q2,2017," Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. You guys had really good growth in Professional Visualization and record revenues. I would've thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family. So I was sort of pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation M6000 family, which means obviously that the Pascal demand cycle is kind of still ahead of you. Number one, is that a fair view? And then what's driving the strong adoption of M6000? And if you haven't already released it, when do you expect to launch the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family? Thank you."," Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. I appreciate the question. The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building, or just a consumer product, or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations. The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary. And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPU use has really, really increased, and it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they've put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there. And so I think that, that virtuous cycle you're starting to see in design. And so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path-tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging, is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That's number one. Number two, Maxwell was the most energy-efficient GPU ever made until Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler. And the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell. But Maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs and laptops, and more elegant workstations, and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses. And I think that going forward, your last question is, going forward, how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world, and so I think in the coming quarters we're going to expect to see Pascal out there. And my expectation is that the dynamics I just described, which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities, our invention of GPU-accelerated photorendering, Iray and OptiX, and MDL, Material Description Language, and then lastly the energy efficiency of GPUs, those three factors combined is going to be really healthy for workstations. And then last, VR. VR is coming, and in order to really enjoy the type of applications for design, you're going to need a pretty powerful GPU to support it.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

And is there any reason why you didn't want to adjust it out, it's a 35% plus of your EBITDA for the quarter?","And in kind of the flipside of that, Mike, we also didn't exclude the impairment charge from Nuvera in the EBITDA calculation. So something that doesn't fit that definition, we don't kind of create an adjusted EBITDA number for.

HY,Q4,2017," Good morning everybody. I have got to get a little bit of nitpicking on my questions here to start off real quick unfortunately. First I want to ask about the income from the affiliates line, you had additional 19 -- I think it was $19.8 million of income there, and see how you adjusted it in your press release out of EPS, which makes sense. But it seems to have not been adjusting out of adjusted EBITDA, so your EBITDA was almost $20 million higher than it probably would have been, without that onetime item. Is that correct? And is there any reason why you didn't want to adjust it out, it's a 35% plus of your EBITDA for the quarter?","It would be not unreasonable to think about that onetime increment as the adjustment of the nature that you suggest. But the way the accounting works, it doesn't qualify in GAAP accounting in the year as Ken mentioned.
",1.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Good morning, all. I'll start with another macro question. Just thinking about Brent, WTI at this point, it looks like at least in the Midwest you guys are planning to run a lot more WTI in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts around sort of the sustainability of these $5, $6 spreads going forward and maybe are we at the limit of what you guys can run in terms of WTI in the system?"," Yeah, Brad, this is Mike Palmer. With the Brent and WTI spread now in this $5.50 to kind of $6 area, certainly that has encouraged a lot of U.S. exports to take place, as I'm sure you know. We expect that we'll continue to see a positive Brent TI spread going forward. But with all the exports taking place, I guess I would believe that we'll start to see that spread come in over the next months. When the spread is wide like it is, what we want to do is, we want to be in a position where we can take in as much of the WTI-based crude as we possibly can, and that's what we do in our optimization process. So, we're trying to capitalize on all of the WTI-priced crude that we possibly can in the system today. And as we move forward in the future and we get our Ozark expansion completed, that'll open up a considerable amount of additional optionality that we don't have today.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," Good morning. Thank you. I have two questions. I promise to be quick.
First, you mentioned that retail inventory is down in most markets. Where was it up, and by how much and why? And then I have a follow-up, please."," Sure. Retail inventory is up a little bit with our Wizards business, and it's up a little bit in our games business. But these are very, very small increases. I would say, overall, inventory is either kind of in line with a year ago or slightly below.
And it's just where we have increasing demand and sales.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," Got it. 8% to 9%, got it. That's very helpful. And then along the same lines, I think your cost of sales, excluding production cost amortization, saw about 220 basis points of deleverage in the first quarter.
Do you expect that to continue for the rest of the year or should it be lower given you have announced price increases to your clients -- consumers?"," Yes. So we did see that impact, you're correct, in the first quarter. And today, we've been able to mitigate and absorb the increases that you're seeing in freight there as well as the product costs, but they have become more pronounced. But in addition to our efforts, we do have to increase prices.
In fact, in the second half of the year to help mitigate those rising costs. So as of right now, with blending all of that together, we do expect that we should be able to mitigate those increases at present.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NTCT,Q4,2017," Got it. Actually that ties in well with my follow-up, which is just in terms of the software-only deals, how does kind of the amount of spend you're getting from these customers compare with what they might have traditionally? Or are these really targeted more so at kind of new potential accounts that you haven't touched previously?"," I think there are three numbers – this is a very common question people are asking, what it could have been and nobody knows what it could have been. I think clearly, if they were to buy the same amount of product from us four years ago at the height of LTE spending, the numbers will be significantly larger. But the reality is, we didn't have a software solution, we will not get what we are getting. So, I think this is a short-term disruption, I call it short-term pain, long-term gain, it's a blessing in disguise because ultimately it'll promote one of the best solution in the industry, which is ours to be more progressive in the enterprise and service providers. Even the software solution could eventually be used in the enterprise also. And this will allow us to deliver more value at a reasonable price to the customer. So, that's how I look at it. I think if you compare apples-to-apples, yes, it's significantly lower price for the same amount of product or same amount of coverage versus three years ago, but that's not the right metrics. It is the metrics, what would happen if we didn't have a software solution. And I think the situation will be really bad and will be affecting both gross margin, top line and operating margins. Now we are able to improve gross margin, operating margin, keep the revenue line intact and then grow from that base moving forward.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Got it. All right. And then just a 2-part question for Bren. On the December quarter shipments over $800 million, can you talk a little bit about what it is in the composition of the review between foundry and memory and other guys? And also did you give the June quarter order breakdown by geography?"," I think the breakdown of the geography is on the web, in our supplemental information. So you can get it there. And it's -- we talked about it at SEMICON West, so it's probably not at all different from there as we finalized the quarter. I don't want to get into the mix of the shipments. We don't typically look at it that way and it all lines up based on when customer request dates are and that's how we end up driving the shipments. So I -- we think a lot about order -- incoming orders from a customer segment perspective. But to our operational guys, it's all about shipping the tool, not necessarily where it's going.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Got it. And on the second half order outlook, you said that memory would be up half-over-half. Do you think that's weighted more toward DRAM or NAND?"," I think in September, right now it looks like it's -- NAND is a higher percentage. We're -- right now, for September, we're forecasting memory overall to be about 27% of the mix or so, 27%, 28%. And NAND will be the bulk of that. I think there is -- but there is investment in both areas. And so -- I just don't have the detail on December but that outlook is for September right now.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Got it. And then my second question is on gross margins, the gross margin guidance for September quarter. If I think about the gross margins, your gross margins at that level were only way back in 2009. So I just wanted to understand like going forward after the September quarter, how should we think about gross margin? Is there some sort of a decline that has happened going forward or is it just a onetime issue?"," Well, I think as I mentioned, I think how we're sized relative to the revenue levels is a factor certainly in that -- in September. I think going forward, over the long run, you always have some volatility in terms of the mix of products that we end up revenue-ing, and that has some impact on gross margin. I don't see anything fundamentally different or structural in the overall business in terms of gross margin performance. And I think you ought to continue to see us, over broad periods of time, perform fairly consistently with the gross margin model that we cited many times at 60% to 70% incremental gross margin on revenue growth. So I think given where we're starting from here, I think if mix holds the way I think it is today and obviously, that moves around a little bit, I think we'd probably end up performing towards the higher end of that range early on. But we'll have to see how it plays out. But nothing, as I said, that's sort of structural that, over broader periods of time, that would indicate that there's anything different than what we've seen in the past.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Got it. And then my second question is on gross margins, the gross margin guidance for September quarter. If I think about the gross margins, your gross margins at that level were only way back in 2009. So I just wanted to understand like going forward after the September quarter, how should we think about gross margin? Is there some sort of a decline that has happened going forward or is it just a onetime issue?","And this is Rick. To that point, if you look at the order book for the June quarter and you would analyze the expected margin, once those tools revenue-ed, then it's very consistent with what we've seen historically.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
HPE,Q4,2017," Got it. Okay, well, I guess given his very prevalent stage time, is it fair to say that internally the strategy of HP is what we heard from you, Meg at the Investor Day or sometimes with the leadership change they say hey, we have the HPE Next program analysis and HPE Next 2 program or something like that? And the question for Tim is on financial services that went up a lot and can you help us understand about that? I think it was up over 20% year-over-year. Yet you talked about volumes relatively consistent – are you offering more advantageous terms or how do we connect the dots of what’s going on there with that financial services?"," Yes, let me answer the strategy question. So, the strategy will remain entirely consistent. It was crafted by Antonio and I. he has been leading HPE Next. So, I don’t think he is going to lead another one in terms of reinventing that. And we are completely aligned on the strategy. As is the sales team, as is the entire organization and by the way it’s working, you can see it working in the field. So, you can expect entirely consistent strategy from Antonio.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0

Yet you talked about volumes relatively consistent – are you offering more advantageous terms or how do we connect the dots of what’s going on there with that financial services?","And as far as financial services goes that 22% was driven by two things. We did have a large one-time lease buyout as well as the fact that we have a heavier mix of operating leases as compared to last year. So, that’s really what’s driving the 22%. If you strip those two items out to get a more normalized view, we have about 1% growth. But that business continues to perform well. We are growing and that was our sixth consecutive quarter. If you look at our loss ratios and our remarketing capabilities, the team is doing a nice job.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Got it. Okay. And Gary, if I could just ask one last one, the Capline reversal, I was a bit surprised that the timing that it would take five years and that the capacity would only be 25% of the current northbound capacity, could you talk about that?"," Well, as you know, we have three owners in the system. And this was a – we're very pleased that we were able to get this open season out into the market, we're receiving very, very strong inbounds on consideration for this pipeline. From an engineering and construction to reverse this pipeline, you are correct, it will not take five years, it's more from a commercial standpoint that the three owners are looking at this. And timing from, as I say, from a commercial side that we've put the open season out in the manner in which we did.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
ICD,Q1,2020," Got it. That's at least encouraging. My follow-up is just on the current liquidity position. Right now, you've got $11 million drawn on the revolver. And it sounds like you'll tap into the $15 million accordion on the term loan at some point moving forward. And if we look at the debt covenants that you have in the revolver today, clearly the availability on the revolver will come down with receivables. But do you expect -- will need to put the $11 million you have drawn into the accordion, or do you expect that $11 million to be relatively safe from a debt covenant perspective over the course of 2020?"," Hey, Taylor, this is Philip. There's two debt covenants that we've got. One is in our term loan. There's a minimum, $10 million minimum liquidity covenant and there's a springing fixed charge covenant, that doesn't come into play in the revolver until we have less than $4 million of availability. So we're not there yet. We will be hard -- we will bring cash into the business as rigs stack and working capital.So that cash, some of that will pay down the revolver -- the revolver balance now. So we'll -- we just don't see the revolver as a meaningful source of sourcing. It will support the operations of the business, but it won't source our non-operating expenditures, just because the availability is going to come down. We will have to pay part of that revolver balance back as our rigs come back. But we will be getting cash in to do that as well, as our working capital converts to cash.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
ICD,Q1,2020," Got you. Thanks, Anthony. And in your prepared remarks you mentioned in consolidation what are some of the paths you guys could potentially take on the M&A front in this kind of environment?"," Well, I mean not any cash buyers out there right? So you have to be focused on the big picture. The big picture in my mind is more capital efficiency that would result from the consolidation. You think about it -- there's half a dozen companies or maybe there's more that all kind of dozen, two dozen of type rigs in their fleet. We're all spending $10 million to $15 million a year in SG&A. We're all pursuing the same customers. We're all working with the same vendors.And look ICD has demonstrated now a very good ability of being able to do this and bring out every bit of synergy opportunity that's there. And as we think about the reasons it's probably on a relative value basis that you get something like that done. It has to be. Debt when you look at opportunities the debt load on the company has -- obviously gets factored into that. There are social issues that have to be resolved as well.But my point in bringing it up on the call is that, look we've been banging this drum for a while. We think it's necessary. We think what's happening now in the industry is going to force some hands. And we're optimistic about our chances of trying to get some consolidation done.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess couple of more questions on Capline. Maybe it's obvious, but does floating the open season suggest that all three owners are in agreement at this point on repurposing the line? And could you just talk about the strategic rationale for the reversal from MPC standpoint? Are you focused primarily on incremental growth for Midstream or is this developing crude optionality for Garyville?"," Well, Chi, it's both. As you know, this pipeline flowing south to north has the capability depending on the crude slate of running 1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day. Has not – recently been running anywhere near that level. But if you look at the Eastern Gulf, so everywhere from Baton Rouge refineries through Garyville, I think over to Mississippi, there is a strong desire to have a steady source of heavy crude. And so, the Eastern Gulf does not have that steady source coming down today. So, from a commercial standpoint, it's very important to MPC. Secondly, it provides a good Midstream source as well and that, as you know, Capline is not yet a part of our MLP, and that's just because the commerciality of that pipeline as it sits today is certainly – is not at a level – at the value level that it should be. So, as this is reversed down the road, we think that, that pipeline is going to be much more valuable, and then it will be an asset that will be considered for MPLX.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Great, thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On DAPL, can you remind us on expectations for distributions from the JV and maybe perhaps provide some color around recent Bakken differentials and your thoughts on go-forward sustainability?"," So, Ryan, this is Don. We have not given information on the distributions from DAPL, but I can say that to-date it is performing at least as well as the economic expectations that we had when we sanctioned the project and took it to the board. We're very pleased with the results so far.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Great. And my follow-up question on the wafer inspection business. You've seen a pickup, and you talked about the record orders this year. You've also mentioned that DRAM spending was up. I think in the past, you've noted that you expect the process control intensity for DRAM to be kind of split between metrology and inspection. I guess, after the last few quarters with DRAM spending has been up, are you seeing more of a bias towards inspection given that metrology is trying to hold steady? Or is that something where metrology will catch up down the line with, I guess, the capacity build on the DRAM side?"," Great question. I think that the immediate answer is right now, we're seeing probably a little more opportunity in the wafer inspection. But the truth is, there's not enough out there yet at the advanced nodes and DRAM or frankly and what's going on in flash, for our customers to fully appreciate what they're going to need. We've talked about our process control intensity going up. But if you look at -- for example, our 3D NAND model, part of the reality is there hasn't been enough out there to really validate the model yet. But I would say if there's any bias, it would be towards higher levels of adoption and probably more in the inspection side. The caveat being is if in the -- our ability in OCD, in optical CD, to take on more some of the historical SEM-based inspections, I think that does provide some opportunity particularly as people go to more 3D structures then there's probably more growth in that segment. So still early to tell, but I think, right now, to answer your question, I'd say the bias might be a little more towards inspection.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Great. Just one from me today, and I think it piggybacks on your recent comment for MPLX, Gary. I guess with the, let's call it, carnage in the broader midstream space lately, if larger scale M&A opportunities emerge, would MPC be willing to consider waiving the IDRs ahead of the buying, if that were the case?",I'm not sure I heard the last part of your question correctly. Waiving the IDRs...,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Great. Thank you so much. You talked about deep learning in the hyperscale environment, but it seems like you're getting some traction as well in the enterprise environment. I know at least one IT department we've talked to has been doing some implementation. Can you talk a little bit about your progress there, and what does it take for you to sort of build that presence within more traditional enterprises?"," Well, as you know, deep learning is not just an Internet service approach. Deep learning is really machine learning supercharged, and deep learning is really about discovering insight in big data, in big unstructured data, in multi-dimensional data. And that's what deep learning – that's the – I've called it, it's Thor's hammer that fell from the sky, and it's amazing technology that these researchers discovered. And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared because GPUs is naturally parallel, and we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. But when you think about it in the context that it's just – it's software development, it's a new method of doing software and it's a new way of discovering insight from data. What company wouldn't need it? So every life sciences company needs it, every healthcare company needs it, every energy discovery company needs it, every e-tail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data, everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it, every company that cares about security, every company that deals with the massive amount of customer data has the benefit of – can benefit from deep learning. So when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learning's market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer Internet services. And that's exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DGX-1 because most of these enterprises don't have the expertise, or simply don't have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or high-performance computer. They would just rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box. And that's essentially what NVIDIA DGX-1 is. It's a supercomputer in a box, and it's designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Great. Thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on virtual reality. You guys have talked a little bit about investments there, and I was just curious what sort of reception you're getting at this point, and what's going to be in your mind the biggest driver getting that going, is it more headsets or more developers working on that? Thank you."," Yeah, Steve, I think it's all of that. We have to continue to keep pushing VR, and get the head mounts out to the world. I think HTC Vive, they're doing a great job, Oculus of course are doing a great job. And so I think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there, and it's growing all the time. Second, the content is really cool, and people are really enjoying it, and so we just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR. It really is a great new experience. But it's not just games as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and in industrial design, in medicines, medical imaging, in architectural engineering. We use it ourselves. We're doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs, and then we render it into VR, and we enjoy it completely in VR. And it's something else to be inside an environment that's photorealistically rendered and completely enjoying in VR. So architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. Now, one of the things that we did, which was really spectacular, is the multi-resolution, multi-projection rendering of Pascal. It's the world's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one. And the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard, you have one display. But that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types. And so multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and Pascal introduced it and you really benefit it in VR. The second thing that we did was we integrated real world physics simulation into VR. The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can't feel anything. Things don't collide, things don't bounce. When you pick up something, you don't feel the haptics of it. We have made the entire environment physically simulated, and so as a result, you feel the entire environment. When you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over, and balls behave the way balls behave, and things don't merge into each other. So that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize VR, we believe, and that physics simulation is another thing. And so I think our position in VR is really quite great, and I'm certainly enthusiastic about the development of VR.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
LAKE,Q2,2016," Hey, everyone. Congratulations on a good quarter. We’re really excited to see what you guys are doing operationally, as well as with getting Brazil off your books. I got – I had a couple of quick questions for you. The first is, if you could just go into a little more detail on that - on your recurring business, what you’re seeing in your industrial needs? I know you mentioned the reflective wear, if you could just give us a little more detail on where you’re seeing positive trends and where you see those going for the rest of the year."," Okay. I mean, we made comments to the extent that about 90% of our business is recurring, and that’s what I mean, three or four of our largest customers have been in our top five customers for the last 25 years. That’s what I meant about the recurring business, and the recurring business is growing. It’s not only the emergency business. The emergency business is nice, but the recurring business is growing at about a double-digit CAGR rate. And a lot of that is some of the new products – the FR products, which in the prior years, we were not very big in, and same with reflective, they’re all growing at double-digit rates and they’re all recurring business. So when you’re looking at FR products or reflective what we call high visibility products, they’re not usually in the lineup of emergency products, as chemical suits and disposables are. But they are actually providing a lot of our day-to-day growth, the recurring growth that nobody really sees, because it’s underlain in the larger numbers that you see sometimes with the emergencies. And what I’m trying to get to most people is that, we have become the go-to manufacturer when it comes to emergencies, which was not the fact in the past. In the past, some of our larger competitors, everybody just assumed, well, they have a huge inventory let’s go to them. But when – for various reasons, they cannot deliver, they come to us, and they find that we have the inventories and we have special inventories for emergencies now, and we have the capability to double, triple, or quadruple production on a dime’s notice. You have to understand, most of our major competitors use contractors. And if you use the contractor, you’re three to six months out in terms of expanding your capacity. So you really can’t respond to these types of emergencies, whether they are small oil spills, which occur all over the world, or whether it’s tank cars turning over on the railroad or on the highway, or the EPA dumping chemicals into the Colorado River. The list goes on and on and on. So that’s what most – in those areas that’s our disposables and chemical suits that are being used. But we are growing and we are growing internationally like I mentioned our cold weather line that we’re introducing in China, while there’s an opportunity to introduce that into Russia, into Kazakhstan, into Canada. So a lot of our new products, you will have [askability] [ph] across the entire world. And other than the major multinationals, we’re the only small company that covers the whole world.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
LAKE,Q2,2016," Hey, good afternoon you, all. And once again, I would echo the congratulations. It really is pretty fantastic. I have just a – actually more of a few comments and most of my questions have been answered. But I get the impression honestly that the opportunity that you all have here is kind of huge. And my quick question is, did the Ebola crisis put you guys on the map? I know you guys have been around a long time. I understand that. But to the Ebola crisis really puts you on the forefront of kind of being kind of a brand name. And then I was also curious, are you working with any sort of consulting groups to keep your name out there and keep this momentum going, or do you not necessarily think that you even need to do that, I was just curious?"," On Ebola there is no question that our garments were featured on the cover of Time Magazine. I mean, another full Time magazine, it was the highlight spread the inside of our factory. So we got a lot of free what you might call free PR during Ebola. I mean after in bird flu, it wasn’t mentioned the insiders will knew who we were. But the general public was pretty much kept in the dark, as to what went on in the bird flu in this country, but it was the largest avian flu influenza in the history of the United States, and you’re going to barely hit the headline. As – but on consulting groups, yes, we do employ consulting groups that are helping us in certain industries they live like the healthcare industry.

ICD,Q1,2020," Hey, good morning, and thank you. Anthony, I wanted to start by asking a question about one of your comments on the Haynesville. I mean, clearly you've been a big player there. And for the past several years and the natural gas outlook has at least improved somewhat over the past several weeks and months. And so just curious what the nature of any potential discussions you're having with customers in the Haynesville are like today? I mean, are those discussions that you've been taking place today or is it too soon? And do you expect some uptick in rig count in the Haynesville towards the latter portion of 2020?"," Yes, Taylor, thanks for the question. Great question. It's good to talk about something positive. But yes we have had and continue to have discussions with customers over there. Both current customers in other words people that we are working for today, or just recently worked for, and then some additional ones that we've continued to stay in contact with over the last couple of years.As I think about the rest of the year, I mean, that's the one area where there's some optimism at least for the next couple of quarters. From my perspective, look, I'm encouraged by what you see happening in the commodity. You look at what expectations are in terms of associated gas. And what's going to happen there as wells shut in, which is happening as you know. I think there's reasons for some optimism, not just for the industry but specifically for ICD, here over the next couple of quarters.So yes, I am optimistic. There are discussions that are underway. I think that is some upside to some of the numbers that we think about over the rest of this year. Obviously, it's optimism, cautious optimism just given what's happening big picture. But I love the position that we're in. As we've stacked rigs, just so you know, we have strategically stacked some up in that area.

And obviously what that does for us is it does give us the conduit into Patoka for the North Dakota Light crude. And over the third quarter, I can tell you that we've been ramping up the volumes of North Dakota Light as it has been attractive relative to the alternatives.

I was just curious if you have to look around at other areas, maybe in the datacenter where you could also add value?"," Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Blayne. The return of capital continues to be an important part of our shareholder value message, but remember, it is still two parts of it. Part of it is still dividends and part of it has been our purchasing of stock. So as we continue to go forward, the dividend is definitely a long-term perspective and we'll make sure that we can watch the dividend yield there to stay competitive and also looking at our profitability. Our share repurchase, we'll look at the opportunistic time for those repurchases and making sure that we're also doing that carefully as well.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0

And so I think our use of capital is nurturing the employees that we have and providing them a platform to innovate and create new conditions by which they can be successful and do their life's work. And so that's philosophically where we start. We're not allergic to acquisitions and purchases and we look all the time and we have the benefit of working with and partnering with companies, large and small, all over the world as we move the industry forward. And so we're surely open to that, but our natural posture is always to invest in our people and invest in our own company's ability to invent the future.

MPC,Q3,2017," Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to tag on to one of Brad's questions from earlier on differentials. How should we think about the WCS discount widening out from here with I guess Canadian production ramping up later this year? And just more broadly how you're thinking about heavy differentials in 2018 with potential for OPEC maybe ease up on the production cut?"," Yeah. We're obviously watching the same thing and I think you've probably seen that – well, certainly during 2017, the heavy Canadian differentials have been fairly narrow and there's been – there still has been a lot of demand in the Gulf Coast for those barrels that's helping to drive that differential in. But with the increase in production that's coming on late this year and into next year, we've already seen those differentials that have started to widen. And again, MPC is in tremendous shape in order to take advantage of that additional supply, both in our Midwest system as well as on the Gulf Coast. So we do expect to see better heavy crude diffs in 2018 than we did in 2017. From the – when you start looking at the medium sours, generally the OPEC crudes, it's fairly clear that the Saudis and OPEC are working hard to bring the global petroleum back into balance. That's happening, inventories are coming down. We would expect to see continued pressure on the sour diffs until we get to the point where OPEC starts to put more crude into the market. And as that is the case, then we'll optimize, as we talked about earlier, with sweeter crudes. But the opportunity in 2018 right now – early on certainly looks to be with heavier crudes.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

MNST,Q3,2012," Hi Rodney. First just on the October numbers I just wanted to be sort of clear, with the launches of the new products you mentioned the Cuba Lima or Lima. Sorry, I forgot the names. Was there any impact from that in those numbers?"," I think the loss was very light in the quarter. It was almost missed the quarter. So you had some launch numbers in the October numbers more from the sort of zero ultra then from Cuba Lima. Because that’s been a bit slow at giving out and we are still trying to get some of our distributor network to take Cuba Lima. Zero Ultra has been taken across the whole network. So that has got out net get impact to buy it, but again I am not sure of the amount of brand as you know started to do very well. But it does take time to get these brands out into the market. So it’s not as though day one you press a button you have a fortune of sales. It’s – these things do rollout over a period of months. But I don’t know the actual effect of the sales of Cuba Lima  in October.

NTCT,Q4,2017," Hi guys. Yeah, thank you. Sorry about that. You guys have talked about getting gross margins back to their historic levels of, I think, near 80%, versus kind of mid-70%s today. I guess, including the release of InfiniStreamNG, can you outline and maybe rank the other opportunities for gross margin expansion?"," I'll let Jean maybe add to this. But I think the biggest opportunity is because InfiniStreamNG has become the combined platform for TekComms and NETSCOUT moving forward, and it's available in the software and appliance versions. And so margins are already increasing even with the appliance version, because it's higher gross margin than the TekComms' custom hardware version. But we think that this will allow us to reach our 80% gross margin target sooner than we would have thought earlier, and maybe even exceed it in the future.

As we've talked about in the past, Matt, if you went through the different products that we have, the cybersecurity product already achieved a margin higher than 80%, and the legacy NETSCOUT products were probably a little higher than 80% also. And then when you move to software-only, that would have probably a 90% or greater margin. So, as we talked about in the past, those products, and those are the products that we're really driving, should help to improve the gross margin. Some of the legacy products, like some of the Fluke product, systems product, and some of the software related to Tek, also gets integrated to the InfiniStream. The drag on margins from those two product areas should dissipate over FY 2018 and then further into 2019 and 2020.

MNST,Q3,2012," Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit more about the gross margin you hit in the quarter and just anything you’ve done in terms of finding the distributor or finding I guess local manufacturing for Japan and maybe Korea to help that out?"," We are working towards the -- challenge in Japan and Korea is finding the right size Cans for those markets and plants that are able to produce our type of products and we are working towards that at the moment. We’ve launched in Japan in a Sleek can a 55 malt sleek Can and there isn’t – we haven’t been able to find a Sleek can available in Japan. So we’ve been working with Can companies to have them manufacture more to actually be able to supply us with a Sleek Can because the alternatives will go to – which will go to something like a 400 but it was a very stubby Can and we just didn’t feel that was right for the brand. Getting the right product to be used in the right Cans in those two countries has been a challenge but we are actively working on doing so because we obviously we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the market -- but obviously what happens is when you start a market to make the investments and we’ll require some capital investments from us to do so as well with the Can companies and to some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn’t make sense to have those costs incurred upfront and then try and launch and then work, found out later whether your product was or wasn’t viable and it’s velocity. Based on the velocity we see -- it’s been very positive but the problem is there’s been higher costs or higher damages with that higher velocity. But it has accelerated our plan to go to local production and we are working on it. We also just had some price increases in the U.K. from our packer and we had some price variances and some damages there again. We had some losses. There were a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons and we ended up with some inventory excesses which we are obviously trying to work through to sell elsewhere. But we think we will be able to work through that as it will normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
MNST,Q3,2012," Hi, guys. I guess one follow up to the last question. So monthly volatility has certainly increased from a sales standpoint. If you go to April and May it was up in the lower 30 if you had in June deceleration, July was up 25% August, September then worse in October back up. I realize when you get the orders and when you ship the products that you can’t fully control but is there something that you’ve thought about or is there some way that we can sort of rationalize how the selling and sell through sort of work here.

I guess any color there. And then the second question -- so you exhausted the share repurchase authorization. How you are thinking about the roughly $600 million in cash on the balance sheet right now?"," First, going to the first question Mark. The best measure of the sales which gives you a smoother feel for – you need to follow the Nielsen’s, because the Nielsen’s are obviously a broad sample of different channels and if you look at the Nielsen’s going through from the July Nielsen’s, it’s pretty steady. Monster four weeks for the end of July was 20.2% up, in the convenience channels was 18.1%, in August 19.5%, in September and 19% for 20th October. That gives you a pretty smooth channel and that’s all sales are basically going year-on-year, that’s the increase in the channel. Ordering patterns from our customers are what they are. It depends on timing of promotions, timing of orders and so I can’t show any more color on that other than to say that you look at the sales going through and you got to look at – I know that everybody works off and looks at quarters but at the end of the day you also have to look an annual base in which I think gives everybody a fairer and a more balanced view of the direction of the company, the brand, the sales etcetera.

NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Couple for you, Jen-Hsun, on the automotive side. I guess the first part would be, we've seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors, and some of your customers and we've seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve. So I wondered, how does NVIDIA play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not. And then the second part, if we put even just a rough year on it, when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business? Thank you."," Yeah. Thanks a lot, Ross. Well, we play in a graceful, friendly and open way, and I mean that, I guess, rather seriously. We believe this, we believe that building a autonomous driving car, a self driving car is a pile of software, and it's really complicated software. It's really, really complicated software. And it's not like one company is going to do it. And it's also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We've always felt that self-driving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny. And that's the reason why DRIVE PX 2 is an OpenStack, and it's an open platform, so that every car company can build their self-driving car on top of it, number one. Number two. The DRIVE PX 2 architecture is scalable, and the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on an highway, and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geofenced autonomous shuttle, a completely autonomous taxi, all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip. It's just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. And the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more nines you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four years or five years has increased by a 100 times, but notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become. And image recognition, circumstance recognition, context recognition, all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation. And so we believe that scalable platforms is necessary. Number two. And then number three, detection. Computer vision and detection, object detection, is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem. It's just one tiny sliver. And we've always said that autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, is really an AI computing problem. It's a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection but also computation. The CPU matters, the GPU matters, the entire system architecture matters. And so the entire computation engine matters. Number two, computing is not just a chip problem, it's largely a software problem. And the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack, if you would, the operating system of a self-driving real-time supercomputer doesn't exist. Most supercomputers are best-effort supercomputers. They run a job as fast as they can until they're done. But that's not good enough for a self-driving car. This supercomputer has to run in real time and it has to react the moment it sees that there is danger in the way, and best effort doesn't cut it. You need it to be a real-time supercomputer, and the world's never built a real-time supercomputer before. And that's what DRIVE PX 2 is all about, a real-time supercomputer for surround autonomous AI. And so that's the focus that we have, that's the direction that we've taken, and I think what you're seeing is that the market is trying to react to that. But maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving that they're discovering, that the problems are related to the type of problems that we're seeing, and that's the reason why DRIVE PX is a computer, not a smart camera.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think this will be the first congrats actually on a pretty darn good quarter and amazing guidance. I want to come back to the difference of Pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from either Intel or AMD. There's been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between Pascal versus Polaris. And one would think that while that's important in gaming, and it's gotten a lot of notice, it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that we've been talking so much about over the past half hour or 45 minutes. Can you maybe talk to that side of the design, not so much the horsepower, but maybe the power efficiency of it, and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems?"," Yeah, Brian. Thank you very much. First of all, I appreciate the comment. The team worked really, really hard, and over the last several years – the last five years, all of the employees of NVIDIA have been pursuing a strategy that took until today really to show people that it really pays off. And it's a very unique business model. It's a very unique approach, but I just want to congratulate all the employees that have worked so hard to get us here. I appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we're in is power-constrained; every single environment. Even your PC with 750 watts or 1,000 watts is power-constrained, because we can surely put more GPUs in there than 1000 watts. And so that's power-constrained. We're in environments where we only have one or two watts. It might be a drone. And we need to be – we're completely power-constrained so energy efficiency is really important. We might be in a datacenter where we're doing deep learning and we're training neural nets or we're inferencing neural nets. And in this particular case, although the datacenter has a lot of power to provision, the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens, tens and tens of thousands. And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue. Energy efficiency literally is the most important feature of the processor. Now, from there, their functionality and architectural features. The architectural changes that we've made in Pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress was groundbreaking. And people were starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into Pascal, and it's going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning, and so that's a feature in architectural innovation. And then lastly of course, there's all of the software that goes on top of processor (01",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi, guys. Thanks. Just on the datacenter side, Jen-Hsun you mentioned three key segments, HPC, GRID and deep learning. What percent of mix are those for the datacenter?"," I would say, it's about half deep learning at the moment, and probably call it 35%, a third is high-performance computing, maybe more than that, and the rest of it is virtualization. And going forward, which is part of your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for Internet service providers for voice recognition, and image recognition, and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data. And the one place where we regenerate a huge amount of data is high-performance computing. Every single supercomputing center in the world is going to move towards deep learning. And the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through, to sort through, and now with deep learning they can discover really, really subtle insights in data that's hyper-dimensional. And so the way to think about deep learning is really mathematics. It's a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful. It's a new approach to software, but don't think of it as a market. I think every market is going to be a deep learning market. I think every application is going to be deep learning application, and I think software, every piece of software will be infused by AI for long-term.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
HPE,Q4,2017," Hi, thank you. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the different segments if you look at the storage business it decelerated a little bit and I guess I would’ve thought that storage might have grown a little bit more sequentially. Was that primarily related to some of the issues at 3PAR because it sounds like the all-flash array and the Nimble business are doing well?"," Yes, so – it’s Meg, the storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition and as you said the all flash arrays grew 16% with Nimble was up over 80%. So a good performance overall, but as Tim mentioned 3PAR performance was soft due to I think a very tough competitive environment in the – in the mid-range and then some sales challenges in the United States. So we are taking action. We are combining the Nimble and 3PAR storage sales teams which is going to give us more critical mass there and that’s going to be led by Keegan Riley, who led sales at Nimble. And we are also going to aggressively add some more specialists to the field. So I think you hit it right on the head a little weakness in the U.S. and we are fixing it.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HPE,Q4,2017," Hi, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess couple of questions from me as well. When I look at the fiscal ‘18 guide, which you guys are talking about the Q1 historically, Q1 is the kind of about 20% to 23% of full year EPS and implications about 17.5%, so it seems like a much more back end loaded year than normal. Could you just talk about what other lever that give you comfort that back half will be so much better and is it all really around the restructuring initiative, is it different levers of growth vector that you have in the back half that give you confidence here?"," Yes. Again, I will go back to two things. As far as looking at last year’s seasonality as an example, it’s a little bit skewed because of one, the memory costs increases, so again remember last year that increase didn’t happen until call at the latter part of January. So whereas when you look at this year we have a full year impact or full quarter impact of that elevated DRAM costs pressure. Again I’ll go back it’s really I think the biggest driver is HPE Next. So when you look at that $250 million of cost savings again two thirds of that are roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year and the reason that is when we’re doing this clean sheet exercise we’re being very thoughtful as one how can we implement this correctly, and then two how do we minimize business disruption. So if you think as an example the simplification of the regional structure the reducing the platform, the SKU rationalization, that does take a little time to work through, because we want to make sure we get that right. So we minimize any business disruption, so that’s really the primary driver along with the M&A that I spoke about and some of the other things, but the HPE Next is the big driver.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong quarter. Your Q3 revenue guide implies further acceleration on a year-over-year basis. Are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth, or should we expect growth in the quarter to be broad-based?"," Yeah, Toshiya. I appreciate it. We're experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming and virtual reality, these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference, is really paying off. And I think this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses. And my expectation is that we're going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well. But it's driven by the focus on these key markets, and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think the one particular dynamic sticks out, and it's a very significant growth driver of where we have an extraordinary position in, and it's deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard, is a new computing approach. It's a new computing model, and requires a new computing architecture. And this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited. And five years ago, we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially. And we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology, from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into; for example NVLink to other system software that has been designed for it, like cuDNN and DIGITS, to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company. The last five years, we've quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all in. And now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably – if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance, it would be deep learning.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

What is the reason? And I understand it's not always perfectly correlated, margin should be going up that much, but is it pricing, is it yield, because the mix also seems to be moving in the right direction, more ProVis, more HPC and less of the OEM business."," Well, our guidance is our best estimate, and we'll know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again. But at some high level, I would agree with you that as we move further and further, and more and more into our platform approach of business, where our platform is specialized and rich with software, that increasingly the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value, that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second, but real TCO for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters, and real increases and real boosts in their productivity.

NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the datacenter business. Can you help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications, versus the classic computationally intense design applications?"," Sure, Mark. Our datacenter business is comprised of three basic markets, as you're alluding to; one is high-performance computing, and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market, and very computationally intensive. Our second market is GRID, which is our datacenter virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from datacenter to any client device. And the third application is deep learning, and this is largely our hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter, much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far, and the reason for that is because high-performance computing is a relatively stable business, it's still growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. GRID is a fast-growing business. I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year over-year, but it's from a much smaller base. And deep learning is not only significant in size, it's also growing quite substantially.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the datacenter competitive landscape, early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning, AI, and also kind of how your products are positioned from a high-end or low-end type of machine learning application performance."," Sure. Thanks. Well, as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry. We've been in this industry since the very beginning, and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors. And vitally, they're connected by this connecting tissue, this connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric, that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match. If you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large-scale and it's completely global. And this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant long-term. And so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip, it's GPU architecture, it's the GPU's design, it's the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world. And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations. When we started this we were in Kepler. Maxwell was some 10 times better than Kepler, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell. And so in just two generations, just five years time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And a GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. Now our strategy, and this is where we're different, not only to focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We've made this architecture available from hyperscale, to datacenters, to workstations, to notebooks, to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand-new fully integrated high-performance computer in a box we called DGX, the NVIDIA DGX-1. And so there's so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture, the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. They're just literally all over the place, all around you. It's available to you in retail stores, in e-tail stores, from OEMs, in the cloud, or even in universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits. And so our approach is quite singular and quite focused. My sense is that our lead is quite substantial, and our position is very good. But we're not sitting on our laurels, as you can tell, and for the last five years we've been investing quite significantly. And so over the next several years, I think you're going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," I actually wanted to follow up, Rick, on the comment you made about the timing of the customers trying to take all the tools together. The thing -- it's -- what's surprising is, I would think that to your tools, [ph] goes with the lithography tool and if I look at your guidance ASML, they guided the shipment down 20% almost in Q3 and then another down 15% in Q4, whereas you are seeing a pick-up in Q4. So where does that discrepancy coming from? I would think that foundry guys will be looking for lithography tools first, or at least lithography and process control together."," Well, you might imagine, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's happening in the litho tools space as much as dealing with our own dynamics. But a couple of thoughts for you",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," I guess, first question, considering the extended lead times that you're seeing, particularly on the foundry side, I'm wondering if that extends also into other customers into 2015. What I'm trying to get at is how do you see the ramp in terms of '16, '14 spend and, therefore, the linearity to shipments the foundry gets for you guys into the next year?"," C.J., good question. Thanks, it's Bren. So I think as we look out going forward here, I think that clearly, this -- and I talked about it at SEMICON West where we had effectively one customer that we're expecting to ship somewhere close to $100 million to -- in the September quarter and we plan to book those orders in June. That business fell out; other businesses came in to replace it. And so it did put a bit of a hole into the shipment forecast for the quarter. I think going forward, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see the shipment trajectory of being positive, and we'll see a resumption of growth into December. And as we said in the remarks, it looks like it's greater than $800 million or so. I think it's interesting. It is fairly fluid in terms of timing or it has been, although, I think that those -- these orders that we did see in the quarter in foundry are a, I think, a good confidence point in terms of timing and when we expect that capacity to get added as we go into the first part of 2015. So we'll see. I mean, there has been a fair amount of fluidity around the shipment plan over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, this one in particular, it was a large sizable order, and those orders are slotted in -- mostly in the first half of the year.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," I just had a couple of housekeeping questions. Deb, this one is for you. I think you mentioned in your remarks on Wizards that some expense cadence is going to impact future quarters more significantly and, I think, Brian, you mentioned Q2 was going to be the biggest quarter. Just hoping -- wondering if you can help us think up expenses and revenues in the Wizards business.
And then, Brian, on your comment on the Entertainment business growing back to that '19 level for the year, can you help us think about the cadence by quarter? I just want to make sure that we're thinking through puts and takes the pro rata kind of through the balance of the year or is there going to be some higher and lower quarters as we think about Q2 versus Q3 and Q4? Thank you."," As far as the cadence of Wizards, you're right, Steph, it's the varying nature of the set releases really does impact the shipments for year-over-year trends. And the release cadence this year gives us an expectation that the second quarter will be the biggest quarter of the year, it's our current expectation anyway, of the year for Wizards. So Q1 of last year had some revenues pulled forward to avoid COVID logistical issues, but they -- obviously, they comp very well because of the strength of releases. The momentum is there and the spring set timing will now be in Q2 of this year versus Q1 of last year.
So that, with some incremental game launches in the second quarter which don't have a comp on the digital side, that's what kind of gives us the belief of the second quarter being higher than the other quarters. And so that if we look back on that business, we can see it fluctuates from time to time. And the digital revenue, and as that ramps, will have the depreciation that goes with that. So while Arena, we started to have -- Arena mobile, we started to have some expense in the first quarter, you'll see a bit more of that ramping with those digital games being developed.
And that's why we continue to believe that full year operating profit margin that segment is expected to be more in line with the 2019 levels for the full year of 38.7% versus the 46.4% than we had last year.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," I just had a couple of housekeeping questions. Deb, this one is for you.

Thank you."," Sure. So I'll start, and then I'll let Deb comment on your question. So as we look at eOne throughout the year, we've said Q2, we expect to see growth, and we're seeing our deliveries really come in. I think Q3, that will accelerate and then Q4, we'll see how many additional deliveries come in Q4 or whether certain episodes get delivered in the first quarter of 2022.
But again, for the full year, we have a plan in place that gets us double-digit revenue growth, very robust sales. The teams executed across multiple platforms and productions. And increasingly, Hasbro IP comes into the mix. There's a number of unscripted shows for Hasbro IP that we didn't mention but are also under way.
And so we feel very good about that business. We had also said that all along that in Q1 a year ago, we were still receiving theatrical revenues, and it happened to be a very big theatrical quarter for us. And clearly, just given the timing of closures, we would be up against those revenues this year. And we had mentioned that in our Investor Day as well as in our first quarter conference call.
So again, the team is doing an excellent job that are really engaged in developing Hasbro IP and delivering a whole array of very entertaining shows and upcoming movies for the marketplace.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," I just have a couple of things. First, Bren, I don't know if you're going to answer this. But given how much the numbers are whipping around, you gave us shipments for December. I'm wondering if you can give us some sense of revenue for December and maybe margins, just given how margins are also whipping around because of some of the absorption around this big order? And then I have a follow-up."," Tim, I don't want to guide out to the December quarter. I wanted to, I think, provide a little bit of color on how September is sort of setting up and some of the unique dynamics that are affecting September on the negative side and our expectations going forward. Certainly, there's a -- a portion of our revenue is going to come from shipments. So to the extent that we can deliver the shipments, 40% to 50% typically of shipments end up being revenue to the quarter. So that obviously has an impact on where we end up. But to your point, I mean, it's clearly -- in the short term, there's a little bit more volatility around the numbers. I think over the long term, given a lot of the dynamics that we talked about at SEMICON West, I think it's -- perhaps there's some moderating cyclicality, but in the short term, there can be volatility. When you have just a few customers placing orders and they're large orders and the ASPs are high, units are lower, it does have an impact. Those dynamics do have an impact quarter-on-quarter when one customer makes a decision on their plans. And I think one aspect to these plans, in terms of how people buy process control, is they tend to front-load it. And so to the extent there are challenges around progressing nodes and they're -- it obviously impacts the timing of how they add process control. And they get in the Q I think a little bit earlier for that. And as a result to that, you do see some movement when there are challenges in terms of trying to ramp new capacity. So I think those are dynamics that we're just going to have to live with. I think there are a lot of positives to it in terms of just our exposure to foundry logic. But over the long run, I think it has very little effect. And as I said, I think over time, I think it makes things a little bit more predictable in terms of how we look at it.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," I just want to go back to the cash balance and buyback that I think C.J. touched on. Bren, when you made the buyback announcement at SEMICON West, I think some people were expecting more just given that if you were to execute that over 12 to 18 months, it would seem like you could cover most of it with your strong cash flow generation, and therefore, barely make a dent in the cash balance. So could we get your perspective on that and just the capital structure more broadly?"," Well, certainly. As I talked about at SEMICON West, I think for a lot of the reasons that I talked about around secular dynamics, our business model, our ability to generate cash through cycle, that there's an opportunity, I think, for the company to be -- to adopt a more service capital structure as part of our long-term strategy. And so I think we've done a lot already with what we've done in terms of our dividend and the growth rate in the dividend, but there's an aspect or an opportunity to do more there. So the buyback announcement was that the sort of the recognition of that, I think the logical first step in terms of moving in that direction. I don't want to show all my cards on it, but it is something that we continue to look at additional opportunities to drive value for our shareholders by using the capital structure of the company in a more assertive way. So -- also, I think, given a lot of the dynamics I talked about, it does offer an opportunity, I think, to rely more on leverage as an opportunity to fund the company's needs, either strategic or operational down the road. And so certainly, that's an aspect of how we're thinking about it as well. So we will -- I think, on execution of the buyback, it will take our U.S. cash balance. I think, reducing the U.S. cash reserves, which is how we're going to fund that with the logical first step there, and then they'll take our U.S. cash balance because I'm not generating any new cash in the U.S. because I'm already paying it all out. We'll take it down to somewhere around $1 billion, which we think is at the right level given our views of just a strategic -- the ability to fund strategic needs and operational requirements.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
GLF,Q1,2018," I see. OK, all right. One more if I may. Just on Southeast Asia, just looking at your commentary, your prepared remarks, Quintin, and you described Southeast Asia as maybe being a little bit behind the other two key markets in terms of recovery.
And you also mentioned that the prices that you're seeing on some of your assets starting to get your attention. Given the smallest region for you all with only 10 vessels, what is maybe makes sense now? Are you starting to consider maybe monetizing that business and deploying it in another region? Or what can you if anything on sort of the future structural development of GulfMark?"," I definitely think that consolidation and concentration make a lot of sense in this industry at this time. Southeast Asia, in particular, is going to struggle over the next couple of years and there may be a strategic opportunity to redeploy capital invested in that area of the world into an area like the North Sea or maybe even in Latin America, where it could do more for us in the next three to five years. Those opportunities haven't presented themselves just as yet but certainly, things that we think about as we think about what GulfMark could look like in the next three to five years.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
LAKE,Q2,2016," I understand. Now, for example, would there be any additional bird flu sales in the third quarter, or is that largely behind the company?"," Well, that all depends. I mean, bird flu exits soon it disappears at a temperature of about 75 degrees. And we probably could anticipate, at least, $1 million of addition in the third quarter. But what happens is, when the temperature drops, bird flu can reappear. When the temperature generally goes above 75 degrees, it disappears, it kills the virus. So it sort of disappeared around May, June, and come Autumn, the temperatures goes down, it could reappear. But let me underscore the word could, we don’t know. And the thing that can happen is that, if it’s did live through the summer, because the oil inclines of Canada and those bird start migrating down to South America. We may not see it in the United States. We may see it in Mexico or Colombia next time around.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," I'm just trying to understand the thought behind the forecasting because in January, you were saying that foundry is going to be weak, but then 3D NAND is going to be very strong. And back then, you were saying that June quarter, you should be able to do around $750 million, $800 million of shipment. That has entirely changed. And now you're saying there's a big turn coming in December. So I'm just wondering what gives the confidence that these turns or these pauses don't change or is -- are you -- are we setting ourselves up for more disappointment down the road?","And Mehdi, to your point, and you've made this point in the past as I recall, our inability to forecast short term. It is -- I made the comment earlier on the call. It is interesting, when I look back, we actually have done -- certainly, internally when we plan out the year, we've actually done a pretty good job of forecasting on an annualized basis. But what is interesting also is it's usually not exactly how we thought it would happen. So if I look at the fiscal year that just ended, our booking's target for the year and what we ended up achieving internally is very close to what we have modeled and process control intensity was very close, and we actually had some strength in share. But when you go back and look at the specific customers in the mix, it wasn't necessarily at all what we thought. So it came from different regions, it came from different customers, it came from different -- sometimes even different products. So I would say, we're better over the longer term and more on an annualized basis than we are on a quarterly basis. And even to your point, things move and have moved quite a bit during this calendar year. And to your point, it's pretty likely that they'll move again based on this history. So we're -- we pointed out at SEMICON West, it's very hard for us to predict WFE, so we base our business on what we think in terms of share and adoption and how we can drive process control intensity and try to be flexible to handle the normal gyrations we see in the customer base. But we have consistently proven your point, we're not great at forecasting certainly over a 3-month period.

That we think the industry is probably plus 5% to plus 10% in that range. And so -- and when I -- and to Rick's point earlier, and just try to think about revenue performance relative to industry. This year, calendar '14, I think because of these pauses related to leading edge foundry, I think because of memory composition, I think we're setting up for this year to probably be somewhere around the market perform in calendar '14. I think as we look at calendar '15 and we -- to Rick's point earlier about our fiscal '15 given the dynamics expect about foundry and the progression of 16- and 14-nanometer ramp, we think that the company is positioned to see some of the relative outperformance that we saw in 2011, 2012 timeframe.

NTCT,Q4,2017," Just regarding the service provider deal that slipped out of the back half, are you guys still factoring that into your guidance for the current year? And maybe more generally just from the larger Tier 1 customers that you've had traditionally, what's sort of the expectation baked in for the declines over there over the course of 2018?"," Hi, Kevin, this is Jean. I would say that we are – they've been a long-term customer and we're on negotiations and discussions and relationship management with them. As you know from reading the headlines, a lot of these customers have been hit lately with the all-you-can-eat plans. So, it's caused them to stop and really look at their overall spending. So, I would say today that is really the situation that we're in with this particular Tier 1. So, while we don't anticipate at this point any large orders in the current quarter, we are hopeful that they will be continuing to see the value that we've provided to them and continuing to place orders with us over the next three quarters or so. Actually, just to add on one comment. We're also talking to all of the Tier 1s as it comes to our software-only solution. So, if there's any – as Anil talked earlier, where their budgets are being constrained due to their own economics where we have the software-only appliance also, we can give them a price point that more aligns with what their CapEx needs are or OpEx needs today, but continue to provide them with excellent service.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Just to – on the – with the IMO 2020, do you plan to make any large refining CapEx related to that? I think at one point several years ago you were contemplating about resid hydrocrack, and then of course that being shared (31","Yeah, this is Ray Brooks. I'll take that question. As far as IMO, yes, we are looking at strategic opportunities for resid upgrading primarily at our Gulf Coast refineries where we've got the STAR project that we've talked about before. The big part of that is upgrading our resid, we've done some of that. We have some more planned with our resid hydrocracker expansion there. And then at Garyville, you ask about the resid hydrocracker there, we have no plans to pursue that, but we're looking at some opportunistic and quick-hit projects to expand our coking capacity at Garyville.

HY,Q4,2017," Maybe a quick question on the Americas; if I am looking at the implied average selling price, just based on your revenue and unit shipments, calculating that out, it seems like the ASP has actually deteriorated on a year-over-year basis, which is to me, a little bit surprising, given that you are reporting really good mix, you are talking about IC, especially heavier trucks. So how do we make sense of that in your Americas? Is there something else going on over there, maybe I am misinterpreting mix, can you help me understand that?"," Mick, I think it's just a matter of the mix of the customers that are in the backlog. We have quite a bit of national account work in the backlog. Also, due to that customer mix, we have trucks that have less higher spec or lower spec than lower standard trucks in that mix. So that's what's driving down the number a bit. But when you look at in total, units in backlog globally are down slightly from the third quarter, but our value is still very high, it's at a record level of the dollar value of the backlog globally. And if you divide that out, our global mix is actually up on average sales price. I think it's the tale of what's the backlog book in the Americas versus what's our backlog book across the rest of the world.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HOME,Q4,2017," My first question Judd is just taking a look at a couple of points you made on performance by class, you spoke about the performance of new stores. You also called out stores that are five years and older. And I guess the question is, did those stores perform at least in last chain average for comp's or were they strong relative to where they had been and what is the soft say about maturation driven.
I know you typically open strong you said you don't have perhaps the maturation curve that's typical of a high growth retailer, but how should we update our thinking on the evolution of store sales by vantages as they age?"," Nothing is changed with our comp waterfall at all. We've seen accelerating average unit volume for four consecutive years going from 4.2 million average unit volume to now 6.9 in our most recent fiscal year, despite seeing more average unit volume the comp waterfall or the contribution of that remains the same as it has for the last several years. Nothing is changed that way.
We deliberately wanted to make sure we communicated as part of our driver of comp store sales, not only for last fiscal year, but also for the fourth quarter. Our older stores are contributing a tremendous amount to comp. So we are actually seeing stores greater than five years that are contributing as well as the new stores that are coming into the comp base, but it's not a function of a change in the maturation curve. It's a function in a very healthy business that has broad-based comp store sales drivers and a team focusing on executing it.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
GLF,Q1,2018," OK, that's helpful. And just back to the vessel sales and acquisition market. You referenced just holding off, obviously, because of some rising prices now, it's encouraging. Again getting some of your attention on the smaller tonnage side.
But as we think about vessel dispositions out of your fleet and some of the regularly scheduled thoughts that we had there flowing through the next six quarters or so. Would we still anticipate movement from some vessel sales this year? Or do you think things are really just sort of pushing out a little bit on that front, given the market tightening up a little bit here that you're willing to wait more? Just trying to understand some timing around sales of some of your less-capable assets within your fleet as we work through the rest of '18."," So we're getting multiple bids on older assets today. And so I [Inaudible] been willing to let go of them just because the prices have increased. I'll give you a general example. In early 2017, some of the smaller PSVs that we had that are still DP2 and still diesel-electric but the smaller -- smallest category, we were getting indications, $1.1 million a copy.
Recently getting indications of about $4 million a copy on those boats. So I'm starting to get interested in that level, honestly, but we're still taking a wait-and-see approach as we go through the summer. I definitely don't feel like the prices on that category of vessels are backsliding. So as a result, I'm willing to be a little bit patient to see how prices develop as we go through the remainder of 2018.

Are you anticipating a similar shape this year or do we return to pre-COVID-19 behavior on the part of retailers?

The growth and robust sales increases we're seeing across our business are really important again to the consumer.
So what we're going to see, we believe, is a number of very big promotional windows that will occur in the summertime. A few of our major retailers that are already lining up around those kinds of plans, and then additional opportunities and big promotional windows occurring at the beginning of Q4.

As far as our regular components suppliers are concerned, again, we try to push up any price increase, we know it's coming, therefore we put our truck prices up, and I wouldn't say a whole, but plan for the two to be as synchronized as possible.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NTCT,Q4,2017," Okay, all right. Given that substantial drawdown, I'm looking at an EPS decrement of a similar percent versus the $0.28 a year ago. Is that fair? Or is there enough of an offset on the gross margin/OpEx, too?"," No, I think that decrement is probably – I think the decrement flows through and, in our prepared remarks, we said we anticipated that the earnings per share for the first quarter would be anywhere between $0.05 to $0.08.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Okay, got it. And then gross margin performance, Bren, as you highlighted for the June quarter, came in roughly about 110 basis points below the low end of your guidance range. I know you mentioned mix and lower revenues. Is the mix impact due to lower shipments of your high-end tools? Maybe you can just provide a bit more color there. And then for the gross margin guide for September, is that weighted more towards mix effects or just lower absorption from lower revenues?"," Yes, so on the Q4 performance relative to guide, I mean, systems mix was about 1/2 of the delta there. And it was really just driven by what ends up revenue in the quarter, and that is all driven by acceptance cycles and so on. So that is how we just finished up, and it was weaker than I had expected. I think in terms of which product lines, I think there's a lot of -- always a fair amount of movement in that in terms of what actually gets accepted. The other piece of -- the other half of the margin weakness was driven by just higher-than-expected costs, parts costs in our service business, and I think it's just related to the mix of service business that we had in the quarter. So if you think about Q1, I think Q1, most of it to your point, I think, is you -- when you think about the revenue decline, I mean, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to have output going forward in excess of $800 million. So you're taking your costs associated with the ability to deliver that kind of output and spreading those across a lower revenue base, and certainly, that dilutes margin. I think the other dynamic that's in there is service is up just a little bit quarter-on-quarter. So service, which we believe is dilutive to gross margin -- it's accretive to operating margin but dilutive to gross margin as a greater percentage of the revenue mix, and that has an impact as well. So those are the dynamics that are affecting Q1.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
LAKE,Q2,2016," Okay, great. And then I was just wondering on, you talked in the past about strategic national stockpiles in some of the allocations that Congress is giving to CDC and Health and Human Services and the NIH. Do you guys have an update on what you’re seeing with regard to that kind of after the emergency build-up?"," Okay. What we’re hearing from various people, the hospitals and Health and Human Services is, this is a calendar – a late calendar 2016 or an early calendar 2017 event. Most of the money is coming out of Health and Human Services and go into the hospitals to build out pandemic isolation unit, which is construction. And so the first moneys are going to be used for construction, the latter moneys will be used to purchase supplies. So we can see the construction going on pretty much in calendar 2015 and 2016 with the purchase supply starting in late 2016, and going into 2017. And these purchases for personal protective equipment are earmarked at $65 million to 95 million. So we should see a good percentage of that, and it also will support growth or sales. About 18 months out or probably about a year.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HPE,Q4,2017," Okay, great. And then just on the server business that also decelerated, but I know you have a strategy shift in that business. Was part of the decline in service related to that strategy shift and as we move into ‘18 should we expect the server business to decline because of the less focus on the lower margin business? Thanks."," Yes. No, I think you have got this exactly right. Servers had another strong quarter outside of Tier 1. Remember, we had quite a large Tier 1 service provider business that had a fair amount of revenue, but not much profit associated with it, but outside that, it grew 6% and I think that was execution, market improvement and some good traction in our higher value offerings. So in addition to stabilizing core rack and tower we are pivoting hard to our value and growth offerings like HPC, Synergy, SimpliVity, etcetera. But you will see some declines in the server business next year as that Tier 1 business continues to bleed off.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Just on CapEx, you guys haven't revised the budget at this point, but I think it implies like a $1.6 billion spend in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason to think that you guys are actually going to spend that or is there some sort of big expense that's included in that budget that is in the fourth quarter?"," Well, we're probably a little bit behind what we expected by the end of the third quarter, but we suspect that there will be some catch-up that will occur in the fourth quarter. So again, we're not going to re-guide the capital, but I think you should expect to see some catch-ups that will occur into the end of the year here.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
ICD,Q1,2020," Okay, great. You guys referenced, you tapped into the CARES Act for the loan here payment protection loan. So I'm assuming that shows up in your debt balance as you go into the second quarter. So, should we look -- when do we think the aggregate debt balance is going to be as we move forward about $150 million does that sound about right?"," Well, it would be what we have today, plus the $10 million we just borrowed under the CARES Act. And then you got the $11 million at March 31, that we would start paying that down with the cash that comes in on the working capital release, we'll use some of that to pay down.

Again, if you can kind of net out the impact from the earthquake especially domestically, just are you seeing pressure from tablets? Are you seeing pressure from more and more documents just being viewed on screen? I think any color you can provide us would be very helpful because again it’s a question that comes up often. Thank you."," Okay, answering your question, the print volume is concerned, it’s usually sales volume itself will be decreasing. But even in Japan, after the earthquake, the total print volumes stopped increasing. So generally speaking, the worldwide, the order – print volumes with – keep increasing. Usually, the risks print volumes is but the total, the information, the volumes of the information keep increasing.

HPE,Q4,2017," Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you just talk a little bit about maybe the progression of margins as we think about 2018? You said back-end loaded, but I am just kind of curious given all the cost-cutting we have done now and that how we should really think about the ramp and do you think you can get back to some of the more historical levels when we get towards the end of the year? Thank you."," Yes. I think – again I think we feel very good about the 11% to 12% in ‘18. We will be low in Q1. I mean if you go from Q4 to Q1 we have typical seasonality. So, if you go back to ‘17 or ‘16 or ‘15 and look at the EGOP, you will see some of that seasonality. The other thing that you have will be when we took out that $200 million of $300 million of costs in the second half of last year, not all of that was run-rate. So, although we will see cost savings going forward when you compare Q4 to Q1 we will be a little bit lighter. So, Q1 margins will be still pressured, but then as you go forward again if you look at that $250 million of cost savings as I said earlier roughly two-thirds of that or so is in the second half. So, you can load it up that way. The M&A again as we continue to right-size the cost envelopes of that, that will continue to progress as we go out through the course of the year. So – and then mix, nice point as we continue to grow Aruba all-flash high-performance compute and those product lines become a heavier mix, we should get a natural lift. So, we would expect to see Q1 margins somewhat pressured, but those will continue to improve throughout the course of the year and wound up in the 11% to 12% range.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

And actually after a 35 year nonstop career, I have actually come to take a little downtime, but there is no chance, I am going to a competitor, no chance.

By the way, congratulations to (47"," So I think, when you look at the service assurance, which is the biggest portion of the revenue for the company and, even within service assurance, service provider is the bigger portion for us. So, standardized means that we are the exclusive provider of service assurance solutions and there is no competition in that, and we have – and the standardization also means that, obviously, we have to continue to deliver great service to them, which we're counting on. But otherwise, standardization means that, every time we take an order, there is no price negotiation, there is no contract or anything, it's basically just order. We have a price for our product negotiated based on this deal, and we just order, just from this thing. They don't need to go to various places. As long as they have budget, they don't have to go for approval. So, it makes the process much simpler. So, we have to continue to watch out for other things which we can do beyond service assurance.

And I guess as a quick follow-up, in terms of roughly the $1 billion buyback, is that something that if you were to see weakness, you would look to be more aggressive or is that something you're still planning over the next 12 months?"," Well, our plan is, as we put in the press release, was that we were going to execute that over the next 12 to 18 months.

I mean, our cancellations in our backlog tend to be very low. I mean less than 1%, over time. So it's usually very good backlog. And obviously, the timing moves around a little bit.

I think one thing we have seen in the recent past as the customer has consolidated more, we do see, I think, we have pretty good visibility into people's confidence in their plans. And usually, they'll let us know if it's not going to happen. But once they place the orders, it's pretty good indication.

What kind of discussions are you having with respect to putting some rigs to work above and beyond that six in the second half?I guess look, I'm very well versed on the fact that every E&P company is pretty much shutting down during the course of the second quarter. There have been some conversations or some commentary from E&Ps about to maybe increasing activity, if WTI were to get back into $30 range. So just curious on your end, do you think you're going to flat line a fixed range for the rest of the year? And do you think there's a prospect, you could put one or two rigs back to work through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter?"," No. I think it's -- it is the latter Kurt. Look, everything you just laid out is consistent with what we're hearing. When I hear these inbound one question that comes to my mind is, is it a drilling engineer that's trying to justify our position, or are they truly business opportunities there?And the thresholds in terms of commodity that we hear customers talk about is kind of $2 gas and a $30 WTI, at above those levels there's -- at least rigs aren't going to get released. There's some stuff on the margin that -- it feels like and sounds like our customers would increase activity.Just given the nature of the people we're talking about, like I said, it does include current customers. In some cases, it's incremental rigs. In other words, they're picking rigs up that they've dropped earlier this year or late last year. And in some cases, it would be new opportunities for the company where we may have an opportunity to displace a competitor.As you said or as it was said earlier, ICD has a very strong reputation in the Haynesville. It's a reputation and a business that we've built ourselves. It didn't come through an acquisition or anything like that. And we get a lot of inbound calls and inquiries from customers as they think about activity over there.So, you look at some of the rigs we've had running they've performed exceptionally well. They're very safe. They're very efficient. Crews have been together a long time. So as customers think about go forward operations, obviously we're in the mix. And I think in some ways and in some cases certainly, I think we're at an advantage.We just need to see the opportunity evolve into a contracting opportunity. And I am optimistic that we will have some wins in that area. Obviously like you said right now, second quarter there's not a lot that's going to happen. But the opportunities that we're talking about are kind of July, August and beyond and we'll see how the summer plays out.

But -- and it's not just overlay, it's all the patterning challenges. So we have been pulled, I would say, by customers to support an initiative but what we're -- we talked about is 5D, which handles several discipline aspects of the patterning challenges.

So, when you blend that together, they came close to a 30% growth rate. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, they had a product transition, that is one of the reasons why their growth rate is so far ahead of the market rate. The market generally grows anywhere from 12% – 10% to 12% and Arbor, when you normalize for that product transition, actually grew a little faster still than the market in 2017, probably mostly due to some of the high-profile events that happened in DDoS and a lot of customers come forward realizing that they have vulnerabilities and then they turn to Arbor.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So, that makes the – it's very difficult to take the service provider number and say how much was real enterprise because that service provider includes not only the stuff they're consuming for themselves, but what they are using it as selling as a service and it's just hard for us to separate ourselves.

HY,Q4,2017," Okay. But in addition to that, you have been talking about sort of the challenges with the supply chain. Since the sort of integration of the product, which was in mid-2018, so we have seen about -- spent about 20 months since then, and from our vantage point, it doesn't seem like anything is really happening or progressing with that. Of course, we are not inside the business. So could you provide some color on, at least, why you feel like things are actually progressing?"," Well if you looked at the quality of the product and the way it's being manufactured today, and had the opportunity to see it physically the way we do, and the professionalism that has been brought to, what was essentially a developmental product capability. I think you'd have a flavor for why I made the comments earlier. The meantime between failure and the units is coming down. Our reliability is moving in the right direction. There are plenty of challenges ahead. It's a high technology business, but it's one we think we can be a leader in, in the long term. We do have a pretty good backlog, as I think you noted, in the earnings release, as we go into the year. Frankly, from our point of view, we don't really want to have too much more in the way of shipments in 2018 than we are currently planning. What we are aiming to do, is to ramp up the shipments, as the cost comes down. So think of the costs coming down over the course of 2018, and then the volume ramping up after the cost comes down, and that's the approach that we are working. In the meantime, we are going to customers, where we feel they have the most direct ability to benefit from fuel cell, and are less price sensitive about the price, particularly given the power density and the productivity capabilities for customers of our products. So I kind of think I'd leave it there. I mean, we understand that, you all probably don't tend to look at this as a venture business and watch those kinds of businesses. But I don't think this is out of character, with that kind of a business. And when I am -- but I do reiterate my comment, and I think Colin shares it, that we feel really enormously better about the state of the business, as we go into 2018, in comparison to the level of professionalism and design and cost capability, and the clarity of the development program that we had a year ago.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

HY,Q4,2017," Okay. Going back then to the point that you just made on orders and backlog as a whole. I agree, I mean, my own implied math here is that you had actually quite a nice uptick. As I am seeing it here, your ASP is up something like 3%, which is pretty strong, and it looks like the mix is a lot richer too. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what's happening here? In my mind, if that's kind of the starting point going into 2018, then you should be having pretty good mix and price costs, at the price dynamics to help your profitability? Is that fair?"," Yeah, that's fair. I think you have also got to look at the investment we are making in sales development. In those numbers as well, we are increasing our expenditure.

The big drivers are volume and price, and price is a big driver, because cost is increasingly a big driver. Costs are going to be going up, and that's a real concern, as we look forward to trying to anticipate those increased costs. We have forecasting methods for costs and look forward from the time we strike a deal to six months forward -- four to six months forward, when we might deliver that cost. So you have got some mix, but it's not a predominant factor, I think, as we look forward. You have got a lot of moving pieces, and of course, it all adds up to prospects that we see at the gross profit level, over the year, particularly and I think of the first quarter, we see some pretty good gross profit improvements and in total, over the year.

At the same time, we are seeing a big increase in the demand for the really cheap trucks. The small value Class 3 trucks and when we talk about the overall market increasing, every truck counts as well, and whether it's $2,000 pallet truck or $700,000 piece of container handling equipment, we have done better in 2017 on the higher value stuff, and if we look at it from a pure market share play, we did less well on the lower value equipment. We do have some programs to address that in the medium term, but if you look at the quality of our backlog, it's very strong, and we expect that to continue going forward into 2018. And whatever you might look at in the Americas, as far as the fourth quarter is concerned, I don't think there is any trend there. I think this can be said, it can swing quite significantly from quarter-to-quarter. I think overall, the trend is for a richer mix of truck and generally speaking, with value rich specifications.

LAKE,Q2,2016," Okay. Good. Good. I think that’s smart. The other thing is I’m just curious, I always think about you all when I turn on the news because there is the crisis of the day as I think we can all agree. And I was curious to whether all these wildfires out west were something – I mean, I have just been listening to the news reports I have gathered are going [ph] that they can’t hire these – I mean, they’ve been taking people out of jail to fight the fires. I mean, is it that bad? And I was just curious if that’s something that you’ve gotten any sort of…"," That drives overall demand, whether it’s direct or indirect. And when I mean by direct they may buy our smoke-jumping uniforms, which are uniforms we make specifically for the situation which are wildfires. Or if we’re not going to get the order directly they may order from one of our competitors who then have to run and produce it, which means that capacity in the industry is at a modicum and prices go up.

HY,Q4,2017," Okay. Got it. Thanks. Also wanted to ask more broadly about your Lift Truck outlook for 2018 as well. It looks like you are going to be having some kind of growth this year. Even if the market is flat, thanks to some of your hopefully good initiatives to kind of gain share. That sounds very positive. I am just kind of wondering, if your long term goal is still to get to that 115,000 units pre-Maximal capacity. You rather and get it to a 10% plus growth this year in units. Is that still feasible, based on what you know or could you maybe -- into the teens, if possible, or could you might fall short of that 10% growth that you might need to kind of keep that ramp going towards the full 115,000 to 2018?"," Well we are going to keep it going, and I don't think we would comment on just exactly what those numbers are going to be in the forecast. But yes, we do intend to keep it moving in the right direction. And we still have our commitment to the longer term or the middle term goal of getting to the 115,000 units. I do think that we have made some additional GS&A investments that will be part of getting us to a 115,000 units and hopefully beyond that. And so, we are going to have to calibrate that in during the course of 2018, and see how that affects some of our thinking. But we have got a lot of things going on, that we believe can have a very positive impact as we look forward. Just to sort of run through them, we have got products that we think -- that are targeted to begin coming out in 2020, that should have considerably lower cost and more ability to meet the customer specifications effectively. We believe that it's not only -- that it's a broad base of lower costs. We also have programs to reduce costs over and above direct product costs, including in our manufacturing operations. And so between the products and the cost reduction, we see -- if you look out into that period, the opportunity to build volume by offering more cost effective solutions to our customers, and you couple that with the -- and the shared growth and the profit improvement that we think we can gain, particularly in certain areas of the product line, with the kind of a two year perspective on getting Bolzoni to breakeven, and we think that means, that if you look out two or three years -- I mean at Nuvera, excuse me; if you look out two or three years, you have got real opportunity. And in the meantime, if you take another couple of years with Bolzoni, we think the opportunity to continue their revenue growth and enhance profitability is very high. In the fourth quarter, Bolzoni had to deal with significant material cost increases, given the nature of their business, the attachments and a lot of steel, the cost increases come on them very fast, and their ability to pass those on right away to their customers is a little different than it is in the core Lift Truck business. But we view that as a short term kind of phasing issue and from the long term point of view, we see real revenue and profit growth opportunities in Bolzoni. So from our perspective, if we continue to work our plans in the forklift truck business in Nuvera and Bolzoni, over the next, two, three, four years, we see some real opportunities.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
LTRX,Q3,2015," Okay. I don’t know what have the operator kind of came in and cut me off there. The new products are sequentially flat from last quarter. So why is that? Kurt Busch Sure. So new products were flat, but quarter-over-quarter and reps are pretty encouraged by that, because we've seen a good amount of weakness in capital spending and most of those new products are in the enterprise space where that weakness of capital spending has been occurring. The weakness we see in specific is North America enterprise capital spending. And the fact that we’re able to achieve just, I’d say, flat new products quarter-on-quarter, I chop that up as a win, because we did see a pretty good decrease in the legacy enterprise businesses quarter-on-quarter.","Sure.

HY,Q4,2017," Okay. I want to talk a little bit about your China acquisition and I understand that in some ways, maybe you are going to be limited in what you can say, but I am trying to understand your vision for this deal, how you are thinking about your participation in that market, as well as that product, as part of your global portfolio?"," Let me comment on that. We believe that it is strategically a really critical move for us. There are many areas of the world, where we think that Chinese design and Chinese cost product, particularly Chinese cost product, even with more western designs, will be necessary at what I would call utility and the lower end of standard products. Its particularly true in emerging countries, in Asia, but it's also true in countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, a whole variety of areas. So if we want to be -- continue to be a full line supplier on a cost effective basis, on our world operations, we have to have a basic operation of scale in China. Our Shanghai operation doesn't have adequate volume, but more importantly, it is in the business of producing the types of products that I just described. We believe that Maximal is a really outstanding company that fits our requirement, as good management by Chinese standards, very good management, and very good engineering, and it gives us the volume and the types of products that we need. We work closely with Maximal to enhance the quality, reliability and performance of the types of trucks that Maximal builds and flesh out the rest of the product line. So it's producing these lower end of standard and utility type trucks for world markets. They may even be used in developed markets to a much smaller percentage. It is sort of needed around the world, and in a relatively quick period of time, we will bring into the Maximal factories, trucks that we currently outsource, that we sell in the UTILEV product line. We think they will be much more competitive, both in terms of costs, and in terms of performance characteristics and what we have today. So from a strategic point of view, that's the lynchpin. Then secondly, we do expect to participate in a more significant way in the China market. We have been positioned mainly in the premium side of the market, mainly for developed country users and the acquisition of Maximal gives us a participation in the broader market in China, and therefore, an opportunity for us to grow in that regard. So there are two really completely different, but complementary strategic rationales for doing what we are expecting to do, when the Maximal deal closes.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

We have a due diligence process, that is very-very comprehensive, which we think is appropriate for this kind of a company, and at this point, we have no reason to think that we won't work our way through those in an orderly way.

But what we’ve been seeing over the last couple of years is that, you do have these incidences on a by monthly basis, but we never saw them.

HY,Q4,2017," Okay. So my next question was going to be really with Nuvera, and I would just -- I guess, initially structure it as considering that you are talking about returns on capital. How do you look at returns on capital there, because, obviously you bought that business thinking that you are going to have to sink in, maybe almost $50 million. It looks like in the end, according to your projections, it's going to be three times upwards of $150 million potentially. How do you think about return on capital of that magnitude?"," I think what I would suggest is, that you have to think of this as a venture business, and that the venture business payout comes in the long term, and it would be our hope that it would be a very-very large payout. And one of the reasons that we separated the forklift truck application portion of the business from Nuvera, is that we think that there will be applications, where our fuel cell engines and other industries than the forklift truck industry. So it's a different kind of game. It has a longer time horizon. I think it should be valued and thought about much more as the venture business, than as a traditional business. But we think in the long term, that the investment will prove to be well worth the -- what we put into it, in terms of the return and the profitability and the size of the long term business.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
CAJPY,Q2,2011," Okay. Thank you. And my final question, I’m just curious, as you’re seeing more and more growth coming from China and India, is there any change to sort of the margin profile of the sale in those countries versus the sale in either domestic or Europe or the U.S.? And are you seeing sort of – it typically was in India and China where much lower type sales and smaller devices and that.
But it seems as people are moving up more into color and more into high end devices in those region, so I’m curious as to how you think about the sale with – again this is more on the printing and copying side – do you think of the sale within India and China versus – from a margin perspective – versus one of the more developed countries? Thank you very much."," Answering your question, as far as the business mass is concerned, China or India prefer the very low end models. So, we are looking for some models which meet their request. So automatically, the profitability is comparatively low compared with other regions. But we tried to make our best effort to make these products more profitable through our activities of improving the product by increasing the volumes, because at the end the day, market is very huge.
So, once we succeeded to introduce very attractive models in the market, I think it’s very possible that we can reduce the cost by introducing the products. That completed my answer.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

MPC,Q3,2017," Okay. Thanks. And maybe just a quick – a follow-up. You mentioned that you're trending 1.3% down year-on-year same-store sales in October on gasoline. I know domestic gas demand has been a bit of a conversation all year, but as we reach towards the end of 2017 here, can you give us some thoughts on what you think you're seeing on U.S. gasoline demand and maybe expectations as you look into 2018?"," You know, Ryan, it's very hard to take gasoline demand off of one month – yeah, we are trending down 1.3% for the month of October, but you have to take into context where crude prices have gone. And being a leader in most of the markets in which we have – which Speedway operates, we are the leader trying to get the incremental cost to the street. And when that happens, it costs some volume, but then we generally pick that volume up. I would say if you look at the same period last year, yes we're down a little bit, but last year was a very strong year, and we're continuing to hold on to most of that volume increase that came out of 2016 and through 2017. There's certainly some noise in the third quarter Speedway numbers because of all the storms. And one of the biggest things is people fill up when they have storms come, and they fill up and top all their tanks off with extra storage, wherever they can put it at their homes. And then you have a law to make up for that. So you're going to see some choppiness and noise over a period of time. So here in October's numbers, I would kind of take those with a grain of salt, just because there's been so much choppiness in the weather patterns in the country. But I think looking into next year, I think on gasoline demand, I think it's going to be probably flat with 2017, maybe slightly up depending – it's all going to be on where is the ultimate crude price going to be and what that takes the gasoline price to. But I think we would expect to see gasoline up just a little bit next year versus 2017.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Okay. Thanks. My last one, guys, is I guess a little more convoluted because it relates to some of the GP drops that have been done by some of your peers. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of target range multiple perhaps something in the 15 – 20 range, the recent drops or the recent conversions have been done a little bit lower than that. I'm just wondering if you could offer a perspective on that. And related, and Gary, I know, we've talked about this in the past, but it does give a lot of transparency to your ownership of MPLX going forward. But obviously, as you take distributions, your tax basis there would essentially ultimately go to zero over time. So how should we think about the after-tax value at the MPC level for what is a tax-free entity and as it relates to the public market quote? And I'll leave it there. Thanks."," Sure, Doug. It's Tim. Let me try to take both of those. Your first question with regard to maybe precedent transactions or other GP transactions we see in the marketplace, for one thing, our 15 to 20 that we provided in January was really illustrative. And frankly, that's not where we started on multiples. We really looked at what would be the appropriate premium of cash flow pro forma for the transactions vis-à-vis what the GP cash flow would have looked like otherwise. We turned it into a multiple because we know everyone loves to talk about multiples, but the – I guess the thing that is worth pointing out is that the situation that both of the recent transactions that have been done, the situation of the GP and the situation that MPLX's GP finds itself are very different. And so, it's I think very difficult to compare two transactions and say those multiples should be about the same because it's really not an apples-to-apples comparison. You really have to assess what the cash flow growth profile of those GP distributions will look like on their own sort of at the point the transaction's conducted. So, again, we're not going to re-guide to ranges or what the value is, I mean that's a process that's in front of us. We'll have all the appropriate dialog with the conflicts committee and the MPLX board. As we've stressed on multiple occasions and maybe worth repeating again this morning, pro forma for these transactions, MPC will be a substantial holder of LP units. And really striking a balance on the GP buy-in to make sure that it both illuminates value of the GP and provides an affordable and sensible transaction for the partnership becomes very important, because any action that MPC takes that harms the partnership hurts no one more than MPC. So, I think we – again, we'll be very careful about striking an appropriate balance on the transaction. And again, we'll share our color on valuation at the appropriate time. I don't think we want to get in front of a process just now. Your second question if I understood, it was really – relates to the tax basis and the distribution that come back. There is certainly a tax advantage of LP distributions versus GP distributions which are fully taxable from an MPC perspective. So MPC although it will not be afforded the full benefit of the return of capital that LP holders will, is going to get a tax benefit on LP distributions vis-à-vis what would have been available otherwise. So again, I think as we get closer, we're certainly happy to share some more color around it. We certainly understand the desire and interest in understanding exactly how much of those distributions will be taxable and we'll share some color with you once we get through that transaction and are in a position to give you that guidance.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Let's talk about each of them individually. The refining logistics asset is really going to be structured as a sort of a fee-for-capacity arrangement within refining. So that's going to be sort of a charge that will flow back to for Refining. So that's a straight charge out of the R&M segment that will show up in MPLX once the drops complete.

HPE,Q4,2017," Okay. Then my follow-up to hit on I guess storage again I am obviously very familiar with the Analyst Meeting that you just had and that you have had at Nimble has done very well, but when you look at the product line, I think it’s much more block associated not as much unstructured and unstructured data is really where the majority of the growth is. So, I am just wondering is it really a sales problem or do you actually possibly have to add more products to the product line and/or possibly do another acquisition?"," Yes. So, listen I think the storage business is benefiting from the explosion of data and we are seeing that every single day. We are also benefiting by storage becoming embedded in server architecture. InfoSight I think is going to be a major game changer for our storage business is part of the reason that Nimble is growing at 80% is because it’s AI for the storage arrays in a way that does predictive analytics and predictive maintenance. With regard to acquisitions, you know what, when I came to this company I think we had a somewhat less than stellar reputation on acquisitions. And I think the acquisition profile that had been successful for us whether it’s Aruba or SimpliVity, etcetera is the following. Is there a complementary technology to one that we already own that can benefit by being – by leveraging our distribution channels, listen Aruba has accelerated its growth rate under HP, because we can introduce the Aruba product line to customers. They had no way to get into before and also customers tell me everyday that they buy Aruba, because it’s not a standalone small startup company, it’s backed by big HP from a service perspective, from a warranty perspective etcetera. So, those are the kind of acquisitions that we look at. So, if we found something that we thought was important in the storage business that benefited from our distribution channel and we saw a good business case and it was priced right, we might think about doing it. But I think you have seen Tim and I would be very disciplined about acquisitions, returns based by the company right and have a very clear business case, whether it’s cost take-out or acceleration. And I promise you that Antonio and Tim will continue that disciplined approach to acquisitions. And I will be on the board to make sure they do.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Enbridge has numerous projects, for example, that will get completed in the not too distant future and we think that, that will certainly allow for supply into Capline.

So rather than getting into specific margin per customers, I'll just say, overall, June looks more typical of what we've done in the past.

In fact, there's -- I don't know, I probably couldn't explain [ph] but there's certainly been customers talking about accelerating 10-nanometer development and very aggressively. And I think, there's a bit of a competitive battle going on in the foundry space to get to the next node. My expectation is that we'll not see high-volume EUV for 10-nanometer, but because there is some capacity out there, I think it only stands to reason that if people want to use 10-nanometer, want to use EUV in 7-nanometer production, they're going to definitely try to get it into 1 layer or 2 for 10-nanometer just to debug it and prove it out. But I think on -- at the same time, customers I talked to about 10-nanometer have -- that is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, to be able to do 10-nanometer. They're certainly going to be capable of doing 10-nanometer without it because they feel like there's some challenges with the productivity in 10-nanometer.

So I don't expect anything to happen before then. I think there's a lot of questions out there continuing to be addressed by our customers but when we talk to them that's the kind of timeframe we see is orders if they happen this calendar year would be at the end of the calendar year supporting buildout in '15, and I think you get to multiple suppliers -- the soonest you get to multiple suppliers is by the end of '15.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Rick, when you were talking about outgrowing the industry back at SEMICON, outgrowing by 5%. Is that revenue-based or shipment?"," Well, we generally look over our timeframes in terms of -- ultimately, it has to be revenue. So it varies. But as you know, Mehdi, depending on the start and endpoint, you got to integrate it over time. But ultimately, if it didn't turn into revenue, it doesn't really count, right?",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
LAKE,Q2,2016," Right, and then lastly, just a comment I would make is, I get the impression that with all these, all this global warming that’s going on, I mean, it really does seem like there’s something amiss, there’s no question about it. I get the impression that Lakeland to a degree anyway might be kind of a beneficiary of that. I mean when you stop and look around these floods and these – all these, I mean, it’s just – it really is the crisis of the day. And I sometimes have to think that just because of the Internet and the media and everything, but I kind of think it’s not necessarily, it just seems like, I mean, there’s murders is happening, I guess, in Saudi Arabia. And it seems like it’s not a catastrophe yet, but they don’t have it under control either. So I don’t know, it’s just – it’s the crisis of the day seems to be the theme these days. So – but I think you guys are doing a great job and I’d say keep the momentum going. It’s awesome."," Yes, my only comment on that is it seems that a lot – we get a lot more hurricanes and they’re a lot more violent than they used to be.

KLAC,Q4,2014," Right. And then one quickly on the OpEx. With the revenues going down so much, won't OpEx should be going down because your bonus allocation probably should be going down for the quarter?"," Well, when we look at OpEx, I mean, the way we think about sizing the business is relative to the roadmap requirements to maintain the product investments that we need to make. And so we're less sensitive, obviously, to a quarterly change in that. And I think given our expectations of the ramp in business, we think given the -- what we feel like we need to do and our expectations of our fiscal year, but also as we look at into calendar '15, we think that's sized right. I think over time, depending on performance, you start to see variable comp move both directions. But it doesn't do that necessarily in one quarter. It all depends on what happens on sort of annual views in terms of how we pay that out. So for now, I think it's reflecting, I think, the -- some higher program investments and I expect to see those going through over the fiscal year, and I'm currently sizing the business right now around -- on an annual basis, somewhere between $925 million and $935 million for a fiscal year, and that translates into the guidance range that we gave you. Business is a lot stronger. That probably doesn't change all that much. Probably a little bit related to comp. If the business is weaker on the margin, probably doesn't change much the other direction. I think significant moves either way, obviously, will have us reacting to it, but that's how we're looking at it today.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KLAC,Q4,2014," Right. And then one quickly on the OpEx.

We are starting a new fiscal year, so September is the first quarter. Obviously, we're well aware of the plans for September as we make our plan for the fiscal year. And we feel very confident about our plan for the fiscal year. And we think we'll have a very strong FY '15 for KLA-Tencor. And we're obviously aware of what that means in terms of the -- starting with the September quarter. So I think we're actually well positioned to outgrow the industry as we go forward.

And then, Anil, can you give us an update on your thoughts on both timing and relative impact of 5G on spend to you guys?"," I think we see a very small impact of 5G, but there is an indirect impact on our 4G solution because of the software strategy. So, as people are looking for 5G solutions, they will traditionally look for incumbents who can satisfy their needs both from a budget and a value perspective. So, moving to a software model, the dynamic I just described, allows us to be the number one player in the 5G area, but it's not going to really impact – have any meaningful impact on the revenue in the coming years.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So this is a time actually I just don’t have, we don’t have an analysis on what that time line gives and how it affects us in different channels. What we are saying is that basically gross sales in the U.S. were up at about – North America was up at about 14% and we’ve sort of – we can only give you obviously our sales numbers. They are choppy from month-to-month depending on ordering patterns and they vary for a number of factors.

So it sounds like the refining base is going to be around where it is today give or take, and the growth is going to be as logistics play through the MLP?"," Well, Paul, I believe two things – really three things there, if you look at three segments. There's definitely going to be further consolidation in refining, there's going to be further consolidation in midstream and we're seeing the consolidation happening in retail. So, there are going to be opportunities across. I'm not discounting that there may not be some opportunity in refining some day. Being upfront here that I don't see anything immediately on the horizon from a consolidation standpoint in refining. But certainly there's a lot of movement going on in midstream and in retail right now.

NVDA,Q2,2017," Sir, exactly. Good. A question, Jen-Hsun, on the DRIVE PX 2, so my understanding as you described it, it's one scalable architecture from the cockpit to ADAS, to mapping, to autonomous driving. But I'm curious to see how that kind of compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing, I guess, different solutions for different levels of the ADAS systems, whether it's level 1, level 2, level 3, specifically with the V2X communication where for level 4 autonomous driving you're going to need six to 20 different radar units, three to six different cameras, LiDAR. I'm just trying to square how your approach is different from some of your competitors in the semiconductor space."," Yeah. Good question. There's no way to square and there's no reason to square, and you're not going to find one answer. And the reason why you're not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done. We all have intuitions and we all have beliefs about how we're going to be able to ultimately solve the long-term, fully autonomous vehicle, that wherever I am, the car I step into, the automobile we step into is completely autonomous, and it has AI inside and out. And it's just an incredible experience. But we're not there yet. And all of these companies have slightly – not all but many companies have slightly different visions of the future. Some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geofenced area that has been fully mapped in advance. Some people believe that you can use it just for highway autopilot as a first starting point, and work quickly towards fully autonomy. Some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks. So you see a lot of different visions out there. And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things, and they're targeting different aspects of transportation. I think there's a fallacy that transportation in every single country, in every single form is exactly the same. It just doesn't work that way. And so there's technology insight and then there's market insight, and there's a technology vision versus your entry point. And I think that's where all of the squaring doesn't happen. And so you're solving for problems that – you're solving for a simple equation that won't happen. However, there's one thing that we believe absolutely will happen. We are absolutely certain that AI is going to be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles, and to solve these puzzles over the period of time; number one. Number two, we believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability. We believe unambiguously this is a software problem, and that for the largest of transportation companies, they need to own their own – they're going to need – own their own software in collaboration with you, but they're not going to let you do it and keep it as a black box. We believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem, that this is a real-time supercomputing problem; that it's not just about a special widget, but computation is necessary. Processors, a computer system, system software, enormous amount of operating system capability, is necessary to build something like this. It is a massive software problem. Otherwise, we would have done it already. And so I think that you're going to see this year the beginnings of a lot of those, of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions. But in the next year and the year after that, I think you're going to see more and more and more. I think this is the beginning, and we're working with some really, really amazing people to get this done.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

With the exception of some pioneering work or early – the best, the most leading-edge cars today, almost no cars are self-driving.

And can you point to specific programs or initiatives sort of dragging that order mix?"," So, this is Bren. Harlan, I think that -- in consistent with what we've said at SEMICON, and we see the second half lining up roughly flat with the first half given the strength of June where we thought -- initially, we thought second half would be stronger but then we had the strength in June, which drove that view where I think it's sort of flattish now. So I don't think that that's changed. As I look at the data, I think that foundry is probably up half-on-half, memory's up half-on-half, and logic is probably lower.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0

And then, it just depends on if something makes sense, how big it is – we illustrated that we certainly have the competency to be able to leapfrog markets like we did when we bought Hess when we went to the East Coast and we've been able to integrate the Hess assets very, very well into our system and exceed the synergies that we have planned.

NVDA,Q2,2017," Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming; very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal, and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now, and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles."," Sure. Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's say, on PC gaming there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about a third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much – and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high-performance; it's also energy-efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us. And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I'd mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. I mean, this is a dynamic that's relatively new. And so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. That's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher. And I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well, as you know very well, which is, eSports is no longer just an interest, eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course the Western world as well. And I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some right content now, but some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots, but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium, we introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world's first in-game photography system. It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your videogame, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high-res with all your friends. So there's a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up, which is great for our platforms. And so I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal; very, very small of course because we just started production ramp, but even then only a third has upgraded to Maxwell, And so there's it's a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

So during Q4,we moved aggressively from the design phase of HPE Next to the execution phase of HPE Next and we are very focused on minimizing disruption particularly with the sales team, but other areas as well. And so we’re leveraging a lot of the best practices that enabled us to deliver our recent separations on time, on budget it was the divestiture management office approach or the separation management approach.

First on the campus switching side, could you talk it’s obviously done really well the last few quarters and the synergies with Aruba have helped. Could you talk a little bit about Cisco’s new product portfolio with kind of the pay-as-you-go model? What impact do you think that will have on that business will be an opportunity for you? Will it move your business to more recurring revenue models as well? And then secondly, if you could just update us on the data center piece and how the partnership with the rest is going? Thank you."," Yes, so you are right. Aruba, both wired and wireless, has had a really great fiscal year ‘17. And the thesis when we bought Aruba was the wireless would actually drag along the wired and that has actually turned out to be the case, particularly in the United States, where the wired portfolio had a great ‘17 in a particularly strong Q4. Increasingly, we see demand for Aruba on a flexible capacity model. And just like any other product that we sell, we are happy to do a flexible capacity model pay-as-you-go, annuity-based revenue stream for people who want to buy that way for Aruba. We also I think are benefiting from the Gartner Magic Quadrant that I referred to or Tim referred to in the script where we are for the first time a leader in networking in the vision category and it’s been – this is the first time in three decades that Cisco has not owned that top spot and we can feel the momentum in the marketplace. So, listen a number of our competitors are talking about a clone of flex capacity, would we dig into it, it is actually not the same thing as we are offering, it’s not entwined with services and it’s not – it’s really just sort of glorified leasing model and that’s different from what we are offering. So, we think we have a competitive advantage. With regard to Arista, so that partnership continues to go along. We are opening up our channel in our direct sales group to the data center opportunity.

So now HPE is more relevant they know what we stand for and the core value proposition is the software defined data center on-prem with public cloud like economics. This whole moved to flexible capacity and a pay-per-use model is actually encouraging people to say, do I need to move every workload to the public cloud. And then our new stack offering, our new stack announcement discovered next week, I think it’s going to be a milestone and a cap stone in some ways to the innovation and agenda that’s we’ve driven over the last 6 years. So I’d say that those are the main things, I would also say the speed at which we move this company was a slower company then I would have like to seen 6 years ago, and now we jump on opportunities on problems it’s far more nimble, far more agile and I think you frankly just a better run company than it was 6 years ago.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," Thanks a lot for the questions. I have two, if I could. First one, just on Arena or MAGIC in general, I guess. Really impressive growth, obviously, from Arena in the quarter.
I'm curious, do you have the data sets of -- capable of giving you a holistic picture of your player base? I'm curious more specifically if that growth is coming at the expense of tabletop or if you're actually expanding the market base, and whether or not you expect mobile to further expand the market base. That's my first question."," Yes. Sure. So in fact, you're right. The Magic Arena had historically been expanding.
It's accelerating in that effort. In fact, analog tabletop has performed incredibly well. And let me remind you that the analog and the tabletop business is performing incredibly well while people can't get together locally in their local favorite hobby shops or local gaming shops to play the game. In fact, about a year ago, and if you looked at the hobby shops, you would have seen about 40% of global hobby shops had some capability to fulfill for either curbside pickup or some kind of e-com.
And today, that's well over 80%, and we've tried to help foster those capabilities and building card sets and releases that would be enabling this local hobby shops to really participate. But we do expect an additional tailwind on the analog business when we're starting to see that as markets begin to reopen and people can begin to get back together again. And so that's really a major contributor to people being able to play and also the opportunity to continue to share an individual gamer's passion with new gamers to the game. People get invited to come along and learn how to play MAGIC all the time.
So yes, it's expansive. No, there is no cannibalization. And then in fact, Magic Arena is just allowing people to play at a distance who had never been able to be able reconnect with friends or family before but not necessarily be in their neighborhood. So all a net positive.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,1.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I go to the other end of the spectrum and speaking of energy efficiency, are you finding new opportunities for Tegra aside from the infotainment in automotive?"," Kevin, I appreciate the question. Tegra is at the core of all of our self-driving car initiatives. And so without Tegra, there would be no self-driving cars. And so Tegra is the core of our self-driving car initiative. It is the computing platform for self-driving cars and DRIVE PX 2 includes Tegra as well as discrete GPUs of Pascal, but the core of it, the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by Tegra and we expect that going forward. And so Tegra is incredibly important to us. Tegra is also the core of the processor of Jetson. Jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines and so you can imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future would benefit from deep learning and AI, but robots and drones and embedded applications and embedded applications inside buildings and cities, there're all kinds of applications. I'm very, very optimistic about the future of Jetson, but at the core of that is also Tegra. And so think of Tegra as our computer on a chip and it's our AI computer on a chip.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017," Thanks, Mike. And then just follow up once again, sort of as you're approaching the end of this accelerated dropdown strategy and IDR exchange, just wondering if you could remind us again how you view at the general partner level – is there any – are there any options on the table to monetizing – I guess it will be a considerable ownership in MPLX? I think at one point, there was discussion of a potential GP spin-out. Is that something that's still on the table or are you kind of view that as off the table right now?"," Yeah, it's Tim. I'm happy to answer that. I mean, I think, as we've talked even in the fall of last year, we were really evaluating all of the paths we could take with the GP. And I think where we landed was that ultimately buying of the GP's economic interest by the partnership in exchange for units was the best path for the partnership. So I'd say – I guess we always keep an open mind. I think it's highly unlikely we're going to proceed down a different path with regard to that value realization. We think ultimately the exchange for units is the best path there in terms of sort of retaining it. Now, your second piece of that I think was around liquidation of the units, and I'll tell you that ultimately these units coming back – again, we are effectively taking a pretty big slug of refining earnings and converting it into LP distributions. And those are fundamental to the system. I mean, those LP distributions-backed MPC will be a very big piece of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. And I don't think we have any intention at any point to liquidate these units. They are a fundamental part of the cash flow of the enterprise. And we would expect to hang on to these units for as long as we can imagine.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021," Thanks. That's helpful. And related to eOne, Sony recently just signed deals with Netflix and Disney, were $3 billion combined, which is really unprecedented. And I know you recently signed output deals in the U.K.
in Ireland with Sky. But I was hoping to get your thoughts on that deal and the implications for eOne, just in terms of how you're thinking about investment in that business and potential for more output deals in the future."," Yes. Well, look, what's great about where we are is that eOne has historically been an organization that's been very effective in building incredible content in a risk-mitigated way and selling to a number of partners, great relationships across the board with the OTT platforms, from Netflix to Amazon to Apple to others. We have shows on the air with all of these different outlets and then, of course, as well as with broadcasters, terrestrial and satellite around the world. We continue to look at how we put Hasbro IP in the market.
There's a very strong demand for world-class IP, and Hasbro has great array of it. We're working, as I mentioned, on a number of brands, and we're starting to see the traction around brands like the MY LITTLE PONY, which we have talked about is on Netflix in September; TRANSFORMERS, new TV series going on another platforms; our film coming next year in partnership with Paramount. And then Power Rangers, and you'll hear more about it, but we've been developing that, and we expect shortly to be able to talk about the brand, new content for the brand that will go after a multitude of audiences that will be on a streaming platform. So again, a good position for the company, and we look at all of our opportunities.
But you're right, we've entered an era where there's really an unprecedented spending on content and an unprecedented desire for these great brands with great story, and eOne is expert at that.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,1.0,2.0
HY,Q4,2017," That makes a lot of sense. I mean, hopefully, we will be able -- once the deal closes, to get some, maybe some numeric perspective as to how you are thinking about it longer term and the contribution it could make. My last question is really on Nuvera, and I know we discussed this segment back and forth on calls, but I struggle to really see any operating improvement here. You have had this business for three years. It's something like $100 million worth of pre-tax that has been sunk into this business, now you have taken a charge. And I am going to ask the question that I have asked before, at what point in time do you conduct an assessment here and you decide that you might need to alter course and really kind of redirect the earning power of the business away from this?"," We don't expect to do that at all. It's just not part of our strategy, if something happened at some future time. But we feel -- all I can say is, I think we feel a lot better about it than we did a year ago. We have professionalized the business and we are moving it forward and what we think, as an orderly constructive way and from a long term perspective, it's by far the biggest opportunity that our business has to add profitability to our overall company.",1.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,1.0
HY,Q4,2017," That's great color. And perhaps the last one for me, if you have a bit lower tax rate in 2018 and hopefully, [indiscernible] cash flow in general from improving business trends, you know with these tax savings, with the ability to bring cash back to the United States, have you ever -- as to what you might do with any outsized cash flow going forward? Is there a way you can use it to kind of speed up the development with Nuvera at all perhaps, or is there a way to even do the kind of -- get that going faster, because I am getting the sense too, it's kind of like, maybe that there are some impatient investors out there? Thanks."," Well you know, there could be impatient investors for sure. We really can't manage the cycle around that in our individual businesses. And I think that the only fair answer to your question, with regard to Nuvera is that, we believe we are going forward in the prudent way, step by step, carefully orchestrated on in the following way, to expand the battery box replacement product line, product by product. Second, to have for each individual battery box, a time phase scheduled cost reductions, which reflects our anticipation for engineering changes and supplier cost reductions to the components that we are using, so that we drive the cost of the components down, and then get the value of volume purchasing and volume manufacturing. That's not really a process that lends itself to speeding up any more than we are. We want to be very careful. We want to ensure that as our products come online, that we have the reliability and quality that the Hyster and Yale products stand for, and to be the leader in the industry in that regard. So that's kind of the Nuvera story. But more broadly, you know, our company has not -- by, it doesn't have a character of being a capital allocator. Our position is, we are going to do what is prudently and appropriate necessary to build value over the long term in each one of our businesses. And in that regard, certainly, the new tax law has couple of impacts, it will help us generate cash, which may pay down debt and give us more flexibility over the long term, to do other things that can benefit the business. But most importantly, in my judgment, this tax reform gives us a level playing field on an after-tax basis with our global competitors. They have not faced many years, the tax regime that we faced. So it's very difficult for us to make the same kinds of investments and have an expected comparable reward. So this levels the playing field around the world, and we think that's going to be beneficial from a competitive point of view, and that's really the most important piece of that, that I would emphasize. As far as the location of our capital is concerned, we will simply have it where think it's the best place to have it from a business point of view. We are not moving it back, just because the rules change, we will try to run our business as we always have in the most prudent kind of way, and we will. Certainly, Ken and his finance team will give thoughtful consideration to the implications of the new tax regime to where debt and equity need to be, to properly capitalize each of our businesses around the world. And Ken, I would guess that simply changes to some degree, as we look forward, because of the nature of both the global tax rules, but also the rules that are associated with making sure that people don't gain those tax rules. So we have some thinking to do. We will work our way through it, and probably be in a better position to comment in more detail, after the federal government gives us some regulatory guidelines. And I think it's fair to say, nobody is quite sure what the story is, is that right?",1.0,1.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

Thanks.","That's right, Al. I mean, we do have international operations prior to the tax act. We are planning prudently, as any U.S. company, to keep cash offshore, to the extent we generated our offshore. The other side of it though, is that we were investing offshore. So we bought Bolzoni, we have got Maximal teed up, and so a lot of our -- we aren't in the Apple situation, where we can bring sizable amounts of money back from overseas at this point, because we have deployed them. The tax rules of course are a little bit odd, in terms of what they consider cash, or including receivables in that calculation for the repatriation toll charge, and in doing so, that really expanded the amount of tax that we would have expected to have to pay on cash held offshore, because our cash number isn't really that large. Having said that, I think tax reform will help us a bit. But I wouldn't put a whole lot of stocking, that it's going to reduce our effective global rate substantially. It will make the U.S. more competitive, compared to the other places in the world that we participate in. Does that help you?

I'm curious, with your international exposure, are you seeing any benefits from the European breach notification? Or is it hard to sort of quantify the benefit of that?"," Yeah. I'm not directly familiar with this. But overall our, I mean, international business is a very big portion of the security business compared to the service assurance business.

SYK,Q2,2021," That's helpful Kevin and maybe one for Glenn. Glenn, on gross margins here, I know you have right share in Kakuro [ph] but even adjusted for mix share, I mean it looks like your gross margins have held up much better versus your peers, who have been calling out shipping cost manufacturing variances, and it's also kind of reflected in this set guidance here margins for back half.

We're still not guiding on gross margin, so I will say, we'll see that benefit but we will also see the benefit of mix come through which right now Wright Medical is a little bit of that influence that we're seeing on the margins. Offsetting those will be will be price, which typically is going to be the biggest thing. We'll still see that in the minus 1% range for the full year and we fully expect that that pricing impact will be roughly offset by a lot of that positivity that we are seeing and also the mix factor related to Wright Medical.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

We, in fact, sold the business on a multiple basis far over what we had paid for it.

NVDA,Q2,2017," That's very helpful. Thank you. And then last question. On the new – so you're just starting to ship Pascal now, and I guess my understanding is that, historically, as you're shipping the new product, the yields have opportunity for improvement and the more volume is shipped, the more you climb down the yield curve. What classically happens here on the yield, and does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters? Thank you."," Yeah. So we've talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years. For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us. And then with all of these challenges it's an opportunity for us to improve our company, and we've implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology, and it starts, of course, with some of the world's best process design engineers, circuit design engineers and process readiness teams. And we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us. And the second part of it is just how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company. And so I'm really proud of the way that the company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer FinFET is no trivial task, not to mention the speed of the memories that we used. It's the world's first G5X. We also ramped the world's first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking. So the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary. I'm super proud of the team. Now, going forward, we're going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness, and so it's too early to guess what's going to happen to yields and margins long term, but we'll guide one quarter at a time.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I don’t think we will quantify that on this call. What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage. Phil Davis who is our new Head of Sales comes from a storage background. So, I think you will naturally see him pivot harder to storage than perhaps some of our earlier sales leaders.

This is Rick. We continue to see a lot of customer interest in FinFET development, but I think that when you get to large-scale production, we're really looking out in the foundry space in particular to see what happens in 2015. We're not as dialed in to some of the other suppliers in terms of the actual number of wafer starts. There are a lot of estimates out there.

And maybe just as a follow-up question, given that it's so difficult to track these things with different contract rolls, is there anything that you can talk about from a third-party contract perspective that perhaps could be rolling sometime in 2018 or late 2017 that could find its way toward the MPLX bucket that maybe can put some earnings upside?

HY,Q4,2017," Wanted to ask you about sort of a competitive environment over the last couple of years, you guys have certainly been focusing on -- you talk about in all different kinds of your business segment, strategic investments. It's really weighing on your cost structure in the near term. Obviously you are hoping for a long term benefits. But even, say for instance Bolzoni, you saw 22% rev growth and you saw a decline in the bottom line there. So could you talk about your overall competition? Are your competitors economically -- is their behavior appropriate? Is there more competition? Because certainly, you guys are pumping a lot of investment for the long term that's hitting sort of cost of goods sold and SG&A?"," Well let me just comment first on Bolzoni, because I don't think it should be included in the -- particularly in the investment comments. There will be some investment in Bolzoni, but the issue was two things; number one, in a modest way, currency, which drove up the revenues without having as large an impact on gross profit. But most importantly, gross profit was constrained by material cost increases in the fourth quarter in a significant way. That in no way, was an investment. That's something we have to look to correct over the next few quarters. So I think the investment issue is not a major one at Bolzoni. Although, we will be building the U.S. portion of the business and making investment in that, as we look forward, and that if -- that will be worked into our thinking in that business. You know the Nuvera story, that's essentially -- it is an investment story, and it is going to operate, we hope, with the timeframe that we outlined for you. With regard to the forklift truck, and I would just say, in regard to competitors that, we have one significant competitor today. We think that -- we are hopeful that the business will have a somewhat different cost price relationship, in the context of the new tax benefit for fuel cells, that is in the new tax legislation. I think we will have a better feel for that, as the year goes on, that it would certainly be our hope, that that will help us to moderate the cost price discrepancy in the marketplace that we are seeing now, and we have a hunch that our competitor --",1.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,1.0

So you're going to harvest that much cash, say, as we go moving from the 17 rigs or so at the end of the quarter that we had operating down to the six rigs that we expect.

Thank you."," Deep learning is a software approach, a new computing architecture, a new computing approach that the industry, that researchers have been developing for 20 years. And it was only until five years ago when pioneering work was on deep learning on GPUs that really turbocharged it and gave the industry, if you will, a time machine that brought the future to the present. And the power of deep learning is so great that this capability is expanding and people are discovering more ways to use it and more applications, and new deep learning architectures. And the networks are getting bigger and deeper and more complicated. And so, I think that this area is going to grow quite significantly.

If we start with the $278 million of non-GAAP revenue in Q1 of 2017 and we're decrementing that, you said high teens, just because of this abnormal skewing here in FY 2018. I'm coming up with about – if I use a minus 16%, I'm coming up with about $234 million. Is that a correct algebra exercise for Q1?"," Hi, Eric, it's Jean. I just would quibble on the definition of high teens, I would say high teens would probably be closer to 18%, 19% rather than more of a mid teens, 16%.",0.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. The first is just a follow up on some of the Gaming strength in the quarter. With the company launching the Founders Edition availability of Gaming products in the quarter, can you talk about how that went, and for those products how gross margins compare to just chip bait chip bait sales that would go into a gaming card OEM?"," Well, first of all Founders Edition, I appreciate you asking that. Founders Edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA, and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. Now, there are some people that – some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company. Its availability is limited, and it's engineered just at the highest possible level of quality. And we limit the production of it. And the reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much, much more able to take the NVIDIA architecture to every corner of the world, literally overnight. We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know. And they can provide them in different sizes and shapes, and styles, and different thermal solutions, and different configurations, and different price points. And so I think, we believe that, that diversity is one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GeForce platform is so popular. And it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace, and a lot of interesting, different diversified designs. And so I think those two strategies are harmonious with each other. But the key point is, we built the Founders Edition really as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us. But largely, our strategy is to go to the market with a network of partners. As for gross margins, they are marginally the same.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
NVDA,Q2,2017," Yes, thank you. I had a question on automotive. You mentioned that DRIVE PX is now shipping to 80 car companies. Jen-Hsun, I'm kind of curious, are the wins here sort of similar in size and focused more on prototyping, or are there opportunities here that could ultimately translate into full production wins and drive the automotive business disproportionately?"," Well, I appreciate the question. Yeah, we've just started this quarter shipping DRIVE PX 2. And just before I answer your question, let me tell you what DRIVE PX 2 is. DRIVE PX 2, of course, is a processor. It's the DRIVE PX 2 version with just one single processor, with just Parker, and our Tegra processor, and optionally with discrete GPUs, you could literally build – you can build a car with autopilot capability, or an AI co-pilot capability, all the way to self-driving car capability. And it is able to do sensor fusion. It's able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping, detection using deep neural nets of the environment in a surround matter, all of the cameras around the car all feeding into the processor, and the DRIVE PX processor doing real-time inferencing of surround cameras, all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car, all done in this one car computer, this one car AI supercomputer. And so this quarter we started shipping them to all of our partners and developers so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack. We have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these, and it's hard to know exactly what everybody's schedule is, but it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years. Developing a self-driving car is no – it's a fairly significant undertaking, and so nobody does it for fun, surely. And the question is, maybe if I could frame the question just slightly differently, do I expect people to be building OEM cars, or do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geofenced, do we expect them to be building trucks, and you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the world's economy is built around trucking products all over the world, to services of basically taxi as a service. The answer is that we're working with customers and partners across that entire range from cars that are sold to trucks, to vans, to shuttles, to services.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
HPE,Q4,2017," Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the server comments.

And then when you think about annualizing the Tier 1 base of business, when do you think the server category on a reported basis can get back to growth?","Great. And then listen, our Gen10 server, which is on the new Intel chip called Skylake, is off to a good start. There is some concern in the industry that because there is not quite the features and functionality advancement that there normally is in their tick-tock that, that might be a slower ramp, but thus far we are not seeing that. So, we are cautiously optimistic about Gen10. What I will say about – based on Skylake, what I will say about Gen10 is we have a real point of difference in Gen10 which is we have produced the most secure server in the world. Security is built in as a root of trust into the silicon. No one else has anything like this and this is making a real difference, because security continues to be an enormous issue for everyone.

HPE,Q4,2017," Yes, thank you. One for Meg and then maybe one for Tim or Meg. Meg just in terms of the timing of your announcement to hand over the reins to Antonio, I got to say I am a little surprised I think in the last 3 months you have said things like I am not going anywhere and there is still more work to do and I have no plans to leave. And so this in light of those comments feels a little abrupt.

So, Tony, I would say there hasn’t been a change in sentiment. What I think is absolutely true is Antonio is ready to take the reins and go the distance. And if you think about it, we have a much smaller, much nimbler, much more focused company. And I think it is absolutely the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins. We have got a very good leadership bench. We have got a strategy that is crystal clear and focused. And Antonio is a deep technologist. And I think I have added a lot of value here in terms of shareholder value creation, financial restructuring, nice ignition of the innovation engine, but the next CEO of this company needs to be a deeper technologist and that’s exactly what Antonio is. He has been with the company 22 years. He is a trained computer engineer and has worked in almost every business of this company. So, I just think it’s the right thing. And I also think Antonio is going to lead the next phase of value creation. We have created a lot of shareholder value here. I think over 220% shareholder value from right before the announcement of the turnaround in the fall of 2012, just HPE alone 89% increase since the separation, which is three times the S&P 500 and HPE Next and the simplification of our business and the execution of the strategy that Antonio and I put together between the two of us, he is going to lead that next generation of shareholder value creation.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

NVDA,Q2,2017," Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to ask a couple of questions again on the datacenter business. The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be, and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the datacenter? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective. But is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing? Thank you."," Sure. Yeah. First of all, the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text, it's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through datacenters today, as you guys know very well, are images, there are voice, there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server, and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter that's running real time on their live video, so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert, and who to invite to come and watch the live video. And so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture, it's a new computing model, it recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really, well, a good fit. And so now the question is, how much. It's hard to say, it's hard to say how much, but my sense is that it's going to be a lot, and without any predictions it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale datacenter will be GPU accelerated. They will be GPU accelerated for training, they will be GPU accelerated for inferencing, there may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that. And then lastly, APUs. I guess for datacenters, I guess my sense is for datacenters, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI, and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is GPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close, there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of, and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny. And for most datacenters, I think if you have CPU workloads anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion, anyways.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,0.0,2.0
NTCT,Q4,2017," Yes. Good morning. So, the high-single-digit declines in service provider, Anil, if I heard that right, what percentage of that is being driven by just overall spending in that vertical versus transitioning some of your customers to software-only? I think you said 8% to 10% of the business this year will be software-only, but I guess what's that percentage – as a follow-up, what's that percentage in the service provider segment?"," I'll let Jean add maybe a specific percentage, but overall software strategy is that we need to mitigate part of the OpEx and CapEx challenges. So, everything is related to dealing with OpEx and CapEx. We just decided that instead of market forces disrupting us, we rather do it ourselves proactively. And so that's what is resulting in 10%, we are – that number we are forecasting for this year, it was low single digits this year. And next year, we hope that we'll accelerate that beyond 10% and that will result in even better gross margins. But overall, dynamic playing in the sector is that customer has X amount of budget. And unless they can buy sufficient capacity for an X amount, they rather not do anything or do go to cheaper solutions, less attractive, but cheaper solutions.

GLF,Q1,2018," Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a question on the Americas.
Just curious on fleet mix here, exclusively Gulf of Mexico, are you seeing some movement in Trinidad? And just curious how we stand utilizationwise looking into 2Q? Now you referenced some seasonal boost on rate of 5% or so, just Quin, just some perspective there on what you're seeing utilization wise in the Americas? And maybe is it exclusively Gulf of Mexico? Or are you seeing pockets of opportunities for some tightening out of places like Trinidad, just curious on some perspective there?"," All right. So what I'm seeing is, areas like Trinidad, Suriname, Guyana, and even Brazil, beginning to tighten up and to draw capacity out of the Gulf of Mexico, and I would even suggest that Mexico proper is going to be a component of that. Recently been taking some large tonnage into those areas, so from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico call it, boats larger than 260 foot.
But there are also smaller vessels that are getting into that level -- getting into those areas as well. So I expect to see some tightening in the Gulf of Mexico -- U.S. Gulf of Mexico because of that. So the market supply is beginning to dwindle a bit in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico, that's given us the opportunity to push price from time to time. As it relates to utilization in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, I'm starting to see maybe 2 and 3 percentage point increases as we go through the summer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
So those are those small increases that I anticipate in the recovering market. So there may be some more episodes to push price on a regular basis in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and we'll certainly push that. But currently, it's definitely on that kind of 280-and-above class of vessel in the U.S.

One is you, apparently with a few others, are joining to battle the ITA approval -- FTC approval, and maybe you can talk to that in light of previous comments when they didn't see it necessarily as a big problem. Secondly, at the Choice today, Hotels, one of your favorites I guess, was talking about how it's pushing its loyalty programs because they're much more profitable, for example, than OTAs. I was wondering if you're seeing the hotel industry being better equipped to do that than they have in the past. And then could you talk about car revenues? Are fleets still tight, or is it much more that some of the companies are getting smarter at least from their standpoint in making cars available for the opaque market?","Sure, Michael. I'll try to take of each of them. As far as ITA Google goes, we've been pretty consistent in our view that, first of all, Google was a great partner of ours and we're going to be working more closely together with them on a CPC basis certainly than we ever have. So we certainly don't object to Google as a partner as they are now. We do think that it's just a bad idea to put together the dominant kind of search engine on a worldwide basis with a dominant airline search technology. We just think it squeezes out competition or has the potential of squeezing out competition in the marketplace. It's bad for advertisers. And ultimately, we think that it could be very bad for consumers. So we're a member of this coalition. We think that the coalition will certainly make its case. And we think that the case is, hopefully, will be well received by the government. In the meantime, we're going to work with Google. We're a big spender there, and on a ground level, on a tactical basis, we have a good relationship with them. We just think that this transaction is a bad idea. As far as Choice goes and loyalty programs there, we have a very good relationship with Choice. The CEO there came from Marriott, and Marriott has one of the best loyalty programs there. So it's not a surprise that they are pushing loyalty. I think it makes sense to them. I think any player out there knows that repeat customers are the most profitable customers out there. And I think to try to build out a repeat base is good business, whether you're an airline, whether you're a hotel or whether you're an OTA. And we, along with Choice, see the wisdom of this. And we've made fairly significant investments and we think differentiated investments in the OTA field, both with hotels.com, WelcomeRewards, which is quite differentiated from what anyone else has and the new Expedia royalty program coming in next year, which I think will be quite differentiated from any other OTA out there. So we believe in loyalty, and we think that there are customers who are going to be Expedia loyal customers and Hotels loyal customers, and they are fundamentally and typically different from, call it, a Choice brand loyal customers. So I don't think that one addition to us is a subtraction to any of the brands out there like Choice. They tend to be more, call it, business customers, et cetera, where we tend to be more leisure-specific.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GCI,Q3,2013,"A couple related to Broadcasting first. Given that there's been an industry rollout in the broadcast sector, Belo -- and your Belo deal is certainly a big part of it, I'm wondering in terms of the overall environment, is there a sense of urgency, sort of make hay while the sun shines, or is it -- is there any more calm approach you can take before taking the next step of another acquisition perhaps in that area as you integrate Belo? And related -- sort of unrelated in Broadcasting, curious about the logic of your Captivate move. Did you take that as far as you thought you could on your own and you thought this was an additive issue? You might talk about that a moment.","Sure. With respect to the industry roll-up, I like to think we take a calm approach to everything. And there were lots of deals that were being done before Belo, and there will probably be lots of deals done after Belo. For us the Belo deal was a unique opportunity to expand into some incredibly great markets. Texas and the Pacific Northwest where, number one, we didn't have any exposure; number two, which were faster growing markets than the average in country. It enabled us to increase our scale in a very meaningful way to become the -- will allow us to become the #1 CBS affiliate group, reinforce our #1 status with NBC and become the fourth-largest affiliate group for ABC, where we had been nowhere with them before. So it had a lot of characteristics, a lot of great markets that we were interested in. And we believe that scale really does matter. And at this point with the Belo transaction, we'll be covering close to about 30% of the country. That's very good scale for us. Could we move some pieces around or do some other small things? Sure, but we don't feel any pressure to go out there and do a deal that doesn't make good financial sense and create shareholder value very quickly. With respect to Captivate, what we saw there -- we like our Captivate business very much, but I think what all of us have come to realize in the out-of-home space is that there's a need for some consolidation and there's a need for scale in that business as well.

PTEC,Q1,2009,"A few questions; I guess first, in terms of your place within the broader food chain, I believe that you intend to be actually a lagging indicator around broader PC units and so maybe a 6% year-over-year decline or sequential decline is not really the right way to look about it.Do you think that the types of decline that we’ve seen from the other OEMs is something we should see maybe the balance in your decline in this upcoming quarter; is that the right way to think about it or do you think that the inventory within the supply chain of PCs both in finished and work-in-process is down enough where maybe it gets less than that type of decline where something with a two in front of it?","I think that, if you’re thinking about OEMs, you certainly are right that there is a difference in our timing in the OEMs. However, our timing more closely matches Intel’s and AMD’s, because the chips are sold and the BIOS is put inside the computer and we’re both on somewhat the same kind of conditions in terms of revenue recognition.

I mean, we certainly believe both of them have very good merit. And so, the key in deciding what financial product will be is looking at capital allocation and, certainly, traction with our customers upfront. And so, it could be either. We have not made it and again I'm not being evasive, we just haven't made a final decision on that, but we are fortunate right now in that we do think that there are a number of opportunities to choose from.

I mean, you did have positive volume growth in the quarter and do you think that was a result as the promotional activity would end? So how confident are you of the volume, once you pull back on the price promotion?","Well, we are certainly going to pull back price promotions in the brands where we did not see a response. The sales decrease that we mentioned on the Polaner brand for instance, was low priced. Volume was flat, even though we promoted the brand heavily versus the normal promotions we would do; and we are really talking, in a case like that, pulling back the enhancements on promotions that already exist, not stopping promotions altogether. So it's really a mixed bag, we had good results on some pieces of Ortega business for instance, by doing these heavier promotions. Arguably, paying for themselves, and we would examine whether we would continue those specific promotions or not; but in the large majority of cases, the enhanced promotional activity was not a good economical decision. So we are going to stop doing those.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

So next year is all we're planning for right now from everything we see is that will slow down somewhat.

LBRANDS,Q2,2013,A question for Nick. BBW margins have been heading steadily higher. Just wondering what are the opportunities from here to continue to drive margins higher. Is it just productivity gains or are there opportunities on the gross margin line as well?,"Thanks, Paul. Let's see. I think, if I could just kind of answer that slightly differently. One of the goals that we're really looking at is to continue to figure out how to really evolve the brand and figure out ways to get the right price and read the right customer expectations. So that being said, we continue to invest into the products. So a lot of the product launches that we've done have taken on incremental cost increases, but we've been in a position that we've been able to charge the appropriate price. So for me, it's going to be less about continued gross margin gains and more about are we able to continue to reinvent the brand, continue to elevate the brand, and then work closely with the customers to make sure that we're not letting retail prices get too far ahead of us, which is probably looking more at a sustained gross margin rate.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0

But nice secular growth story outside of the top 50. So if you sum those up, you're looking at the Americas, it seems to be at the low end of guidance or a little bit higher even. So what are the international expectations in '14?","At this juncture, it's a little premature, Joe, to try to lock in on a kind of an estimate of where we'll be at. You saw the results in the first quarter and we believe they'll be better in the second quarter. So we'll see a trajectory that's probably moving constant currency into the mid- to high-single-digits type of thing. For the second half of the year, we don't see anything that would take the trajectory lower or higher. There could be some upside as the year unfolds, as it relates to emerging markets.

TDC,Q1,2014,"A quick one. On the top 50 customers, I mean, Mike, how do you think about it? So are we kind of in a way going through a process of people taking off what wasn't kind of -- shouldn't really ideally be in the EDW, moving that to kind of more efficient -- cost-efficient media as -- which basically means you have like a time where people don't have to do the capacity upgrades because they're kind of freeing up capacity, and then eventually, because we have data growth, that should come back to be kind of normalized growth rates? Is that the way you think about it? And is that kind of in a way what's going on at the top 50 customers?","Raimo, it's actually partially what you're seeing there, the way you're thinking about it. I think more of the impact is kind of outside of the integrated data warehouse. So what we're seeing is increased investments there, if you will, in the broader analytical ecosystem. And we're competing for business there. It's a bunch of different types of workloads. Some of the competitors are just good enough and it's point solutions and everything else, and we have our Teradata data warehouse appliances there, as well as other things we're doing with Hadoop and Aster and everything else. It's way beyond Hadoop, what's going on in the analytical ecosystems. So the business we're winning, for the most part, today and really with the subset of the top 50 customers, is in the analytical ecosystem, and it comes with a much lower average selling price than when they're adding to the integrated data warehouses. The other subset of the top 50, by the way, there's still integrated data warehouse expansions, purchases and everything else. But when you look at the whole thing in aggregate, our revenue declined last year and it's going to decline to a lesser degree here in the first half. In terms of workloads coming off of the integrated data warehouse, there's not much. I cite an example of some things like for big computations, like around scoring and simulations, but we've also had that over the years with SaaS, where we're offloading to a dependent data mart and doing -- and workloads there. So there's a little bit of that. There's not much ETL. There's dependent data marts that sometimes come into play for simpler workloads that come off the data warehouse and we -- off the IDW. And we do that with our appliances, as well as we're competing with some good-enough types of dependent data marts, databases, if you will. But once again, that's not new, and when that's occurred in previous years to keep companies to keep costs down, a lot of times, these customers will circle back and then realize the cost of duplicated data, the movement of the data and everything else and it gets recentralized again. So the net-net of it is, there is some demand for more work on the IDWs out there. It'll show up eventually. We're just not counting on it right now. And those fundamentals are still there as we look going forward. I don't know if that helps with your answer, Raimo, or if you'd like further clarification.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

EXPE,Q3,2010,"Actually I have a couple of questions on the Asian market. What kind of investments do you need to make in Asia to fuel your growth further? How long will you be in investment mode there? And can you give us some sense of where you are in terms of current penetration in that market and where you can be in two, three years?","I think as far as APAC goes, the investments that we make is pretty broad. One is just an investment in opening up new points-of-sale. There's technology investment that we have to make. There's a fairly significant localization investment that we have to make as far as taking all of the content that we have, the hotel content, et cetera, and making sure that it's localized so that local customers can find the information in their own languages. There's also investments that we have to make in payments. Payments in each market differ sometimes significantly. For example, India is a big market at the Internet Bank Pay, which is a payment system that we are launching, et cetera. So as you go local, you have to make sure that you'll allow people to pay in their local market currency, so to speak. Initially, when we launch, we typically launch with variable marketing, Google, other variable marketing channels that are available in a local market. And we tend to lose money as we enter that market for the first couple of years. After we establish a presence there, we will sometimes go on with brand marketing, and I think that's the stage that you're seeing some of our points-of-sale in Asia. In Australia, we are investing in brand marketing. In Japan, some of the other points-of-sale. We are establishing a brand which increases traffic to the sites and also tends to increase our conversion number on those sites as well. That kind of brand marketing doesn't bring with it immediate returns and you have to go negative for a while before it turns positive. And I would say that that's where we are in a number of our Asian markets as far as starting the brand marketing spend and then in other markets as far as expanding the reach of our sites. The good news is that Asia, in general, for us is generally a breakeven to positive on the transactional side. With TripAdvisor, we are investing pretty aggressively in China. And then eLong, also in China, has really turned around and has accelerated its growth. So we're well established. We know the game plan there, and we're pretty confident that the investments that we're going to make in Asia are going to bring with them some pretty significant returns over the kind of two to five-year time frame. How big is it going to get is anyone's question. I think if you look at Asia five to 10 years from now, it's going to be as large as, if not larger, than the European, U.S. markets and we want to have the kind of penetrations that we have in the U.S. in Asia, and that's going to take some focus.

I’m certainly it’s probably both, but what do you think is going to be the first area to have success?","Yes, I think there is kind of four different use cases in a general sense without getting into consumer types. The hybrid that is kind of a high end laptop for somebody and as a laptop it’s virtualized and supports both Windows and HyperSpace simultaneously and bounce back freely, so that’s kind of the high end. To go to the other stream, the low end, the Netbook, it’s something that only has HyperSpace installed in it and there’s probably no Windows and so in that context, on a Netbook, we might be competitive.Then you get into the dual options kind of in the middle where somebody is primarily using HyperSpace because they use, like my daughter, Facebook all day and rarely need to bounce over to Windows, where somebody else maybe 50-50 or a little more uses Windows and uses the dual option much more frequently to get into Windows.

So on the Aerospace side, obviously, strong backlog, record backlog, right? Contributing a majority in terms of the OEM space. So we expect that to be double-digit growth clearly going into 2013. When you factor in the kind of, I would call, planned flattish level for aerospace aftermarket, we're being a little cautious there rightfully, so given 2012 in terms of how that played out. For Aerospace segment, we would expect low double-digit growth. On the Industrial piece, I'll actually -- let me comment on 2 pieces; one is without Synventive, and then one is kind of with Synventive, obviously, a lot of M&A contribution growth, inorganic growth, if you will, in that number. So without Synventive, we actually see, I would say, mid-single-digit type of growth globally, all right, within the Industrial segment and that would be the addition of our Raymond business to that segment. Clearly with Synventive, the revenues we anticipate are consistent with what we've communicated in the past than were close to 25% to 30% type of growth.

I would say within the U.S. the tailwind of the shift to the ASC and RSC [ph] offenses, in addition to great cadence of new products has really fueled very strong growth. And we had a 20% growth in the first quarter in the U.S. in our sports medicine business.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NWSA,Q2,2011,All right. And then so within that is the half million a week?,"Yes, that’s correct.

GVP,Q1,2021,"All right. Great. And then maybe just a couple more here. Obviously, the Company has been well entrenched in North America, particularly within nuclear here. Are there other geographies that are opportunities for the Company, both within nuclear as well as other power sources?","Yes, for sure. We've had a long standing robust business overseas, really almost since the Company was founded. So over the past year, we've been delivering projects in the United Kingdom, in Slovakia, in the Ukraine, mostly by delivering those projects from our domestic locations here in the United States and only with essential travel meeting to go there. One of the silver linings of the pandemic, we've been able to deliver these solutions -- improve we can deliver these solutions with technology delivery versus having to fly over and remain entrenched, say, as we may have in the past. So there's value added there. We have a very extensive work that we've done in South Korea and continue to do work there. And I'll note, in Japan, Japan was 1/3 of our business prior to Fukushima. And obviously, with Fukushima, that was like turning off the spigot. But we've seen that spigot crack back open three, four years ago as we started to get new order flow from Japan. It's modest, but we remain engaged in that country with very close ties and good relationships and look forward to see that grow as Japan starts up their fleet.",1.0,0.0,0,2.0,1.0,1.0
NMRX,Q3,2013,"All right. I'll just sneak one more and if I could. Rick, you guys, talked in your prepared remarks about OpEx being flat or slightly up sequentially.

GVP,Q1,2021,"All right. Maybe just one more here. In the Workforce Solutions division, obviously, the labor market is very tight. How does the Company make sure it can supply the necessary workforce or really the required engineers there?","Yes, it's a great question. Our workforce solution value-added is, we have a robust and very proprietary database of highly skilled workers that are available for on-demand work. And we -- they are as much our customers as our end-user utility customers are. So we work really hard to build up great relationships with these professionals over the long term. There -- we reach out to them when projects become available, and they have the option to work when they want to and need to.

SYKE,Q1,2015,"All right. So one last question then. In terms of the demand softness that you are seeing on telecom side starting in this quarter or the second quarter, how many companies, how many customers are we talking about where you are seeing that? Is it just one customer or is it multiple customers?","Yes. We are looking at around three to four customers for us. And it's something, to me, I think again is that we are just seeing in the state of the competitiveness for those large market that we serve that industry and just the dynamics that are taking place. One thing to emphasize in that, we are giving you guys the guidance based on the forecast that we got from our client. They know their business well. We have to trust in that. But I will tell you, these are not program completions, right, or what sometimes we refer to as end-of-life. These are volume forecast. So it could change. We are not in a position to do that right now and this is our guidance and this is what we are operating on today based on that forecast.

PM,Q1,2016,"All right. Thanks, Jacek. That's a good amount of detail. And just a follow-up on the EU, as we think about the growth outlook for volumes and mix in the region, how do you think about the potential for the favorable immigration impact that you mentioned to potentially support stable volumes over a longer period of time, or potentially positive volumes? Because it sort of continues to be more constructive on a volume level than we would have expected.","Look, the way we look, I look at this – the EU region is that I still would maintain that all of our parameters staying equal, EU is in a sort, or should be in a sort of a secular decline of 1% to 2% per annum, okay? And I think obviously when you had the recovery of the illicit trade, which you had some – much of this pressure from the fine-cut products, some recovery from electronic E-Vapor products, electronic cigarettes, I mean that we could see that these trends could be better than the secular trend. And then, we all reading, watching the same news, and we all hear about the immigrations. I mean that these things are getting into a bit larger scale, at least recently. It's difficult to put a number, how much does this contribute to the volume fluctuations. But this will be difficult to deny at this stage at least that there is some impact of that fig. I mean, we recognize it – I recognized it in my remarks, but as much as I am willing, and you know me, on many occasions to give more details, I can't offer you a number. But there is some impact. Clearly there is some positive impact on the EU from immigration.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
CTAS,Q1,2008,"All right. Thanks. And one final one if I could. It sounds like a little bit of a slowdown in Uniform sales, could you just give a little bit more color? You mentioned it could be lumpy year-to-year, and I think you indicated you think it’s going to be a little softer for foreseeable future. Just kind of a little bit bigger picture color there? Thanks.","Yes it… we certainly are a little disappointed in the results in the direct sale Uniforms. That is the one area that surprised us a little bit coming out of the gate here this fiscal year. It looks like that many of the large lodging and casino gaming type businesses are not doing as aggressive a roll out as we initially had planned. So, our hope is that the… as we move throughout the year, we will be able to get some of that back. But it’s one of those businesses that is very choppy. We talked about that over the years, so we hope that we will see an improvement as we go throughout the year.

Well, great job on the quarter and in the absence of too much else to pick on, I guess I’ll ask the standard component question of Tim, what is your outlook in terms of pricing and component supply going into the June quarter, please?","Hi, Rich. March quarter, we believed that most of the excess inventory in the supply chain was consumed. And so, where we see the component environment still being favorable on an overall basis, it will be some commodities like NAND as an example, which will increase sequentially. NAND in particular has recently increased due to reduced wafer starts from several of the suppliers attempting to address the profitability issues. Other than that, I think last quarter was about wringing out excess inventory environment we continue to be favorable, but I don’t expect to see the level of reductions that we experienced in calendar quarter one.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So kind of -- B&G's appetite to do a transaction right now, given the potential management changes with your retirement and where your organization is right now, if you could just share that, that would be helpful?","Well if the right deal comes along, we are going to be very interested in doing it. Having said that, we would be very selective. We try and be very selective all the time, but given our present circumstances, that has nothing to do with my retirement. We would be very selective. I mean, we -- you could argue that are not in very different circumstances than we were in when we did the Specialty Brands acquisition. We were eager to do that acquisition, because it was a very-very good fit with our existing business and something that we saw, not only immediately accretive aspects to it, but also good potential down the road. Another acquisition like that comes along, and I think we are going to have appetite to look at that hard, and trust me, I am not the critical factor in executing those acquisitions.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,0.0,2.0
B,Q4,2012,"All right. That's perfect. And then just on -- you were very clear on the capital allocation side, but I'm wondering as you kind of go through some of these moves with the portfolio and integrating Synventive, what's the appetite for maybe adding onto the business, not necessarily via new stool or leg of the stool, but just what the appetite for acquisitions might be and maybe what the pipeline looks like?","First of all, we have a large appetite for acquisitions especially now, but we're looking at several things. Our strategy of becoming more closely aligned, differentiated Aero Industrial business stands solid. And I might add, Patrick had a major hand, as well as Chris, in developing that strategy, so we expect that to continue going forward. Right now, we're looking at businesses or acquisitions that are aligned with the Synventive-orientated platform, as well as our Aero and industrial platforms to meet those criteria. So bolt-ons to existing businesses is the way I would identify those, not necessarily another leg of the stool, but building out a business that could potentially become another segment, such as Synventive's hot runner market may be one of the long-term goals.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0

On the biomedical distribution, I just want to confirm are those for the or my is overwhelming. So just want to make sure I’m thinking about that correctly?","I don’t know that is where the Nu.Q first, which was, we got this kit CE mark, for the blood cancers in Europe. As you are seeing the dogs, it works very well on the blood cancers, and they are looking to see if they can get some traction in Eastern Europe. And as that is not one of our key markets, I don’t quite a large companies as you know. This is both sides just kind of feeling each other out, if you will see, what if they can find a market in Eastern Europe and if we like working with them, so they have gotten to the end of the year to see if they think they can make a go of it in Eastern Europe, given the data they have or collect more data. So we are getting a lot of interest from different groups just kind of trying to work out how they can be involved is Nu.Q going to be, I think and as they are a very good company, and quite an established company. And it is a footprint where we didn’t really have any traction in Eastern Europe, we thought it was a good thing to do. And there is a lot of these smaller deals bubbling as well as the bigger deals we talked about. As we sort of work out ourselves, and they work out how the patchwork is going to work in all our different products. So it was good to get this first one, the first run on the board, if you will.

SPTN,Q4,2014,"Also on the acquisition front, you talked about the merger being a new platform for acquisition driven growth. I think when you originally announced the deal you said maybe 18 months after the acquisition you could start thinking about doing acquisitions. We’re kind of getting close to that milestone. Where do you see the opportunities? Is it more on wholesale or retail? Then maybe if Dave could comment on where you’d be comfortable moving the financial leverage if a new deal came up because right now you’re at 2.4 times debt-to-EBITDA, where could that move up to if you saw something sizeable?","I’ll take the last part first. We’re at 2.4 times, I think we started the year at 2.9 times, so we’ve gotten that leverage down. We’ve discussed in here we’ll try to get this down to two times leverage which we feel very comfortable at. If you watch Spartan and really under Dave’s leadership over the years, we’ve levered up and we’ve been very diligent about paying down that debt. I think the answer is really it depends. It depends on the kind of transaction that we’re looking at. Could we get into the high threes and feel somewhat comfortable? I think yes we could for the right opportunity, for the right strategic opportunity to grow the business. I don’t think that kind of leverage would concern us whatsoever. Dave you can chime in if you’re feeling any differently about that. On the opportunities, I think they continue to exist and we are getting closer to the 18 months and we’re always opportunistically looking for the right acquisitions and we think that with 18 months or so behind us we will be better equipped to do it. But, we’re not going to do an acquisition for the sake of doing one.

MNST,Q3,2012,Also on the margin question and to make sure I understand it. How much was the actual product damages versus just the additional cost related to shipping product out to Korea and Japan. Were there pallets that needed to get resent and more one-time damages that were…," There were a number of issues that we faced. Products – sometimes the specs are very tight for Japan and they really are much tighter than the U.S. project were perfectly capable in the U.S. We were being inspected and we are being rejected for minor things, the blemishes and scratches and there’s a whole host of things and dense – they have some pressure issues on cap rates and defective cap issues. So were a whole lot of issues there and again just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And it’s something that is just difficult to ship full Cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to regain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But it got to a point where literally every case had to be disassembled, examined Can-by-Can and then repacked and that’s where the costs became very high, and as a result our margins were very little but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching and we needed to continue and the result is we’ve been able to establish our brand very strong, very solidly in the Japanese market but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all these different regions, but as we go forward we hope that we will avoid the damages, we hope we will avoid having to continue these very costly labor and meddling inspections to satisfy our Japanese customers and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards which are just very exerting because compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0

So I think they’ve grown enough probably anybody who did a deal with them, to their credit, they did a deal and probably have exceeded everybody's expectations on growth.

I mean, clearly, those consumers get back to the conventional cigarette. So this again, you will have to go into market-by-market basis. What is happening, as you know, the e-cigarette category does not attract a lot of loyalty to the category itself.

And it's -- it's changing rapidly just by virtue of its growth rate and we look at the promotion efficacy of some things that we ran a year ago versus today. There are a lot more competitors and attendees in the third-party delivery order platform. So when they're running and we're participating in certain promotions, it's -- it's more difficult to stand out and they're just not as incremental, frankly, as what they were even a year ago.So we're working with third-party partners and putting, you know, Kevin's teams creative hats on to look for ways where we can stand out and differentiate more than just the standard offers. And -- and, you know, it's going to take some -- some trial and error but I think we're not going to -- you know, we're not going to spend our way to buying sales at levels that we don't think really make margin sense either.

Now, when I say slowdown we're still in healthy double-digit growth rates here so, just be -- to be clear about that.

The coal business is a reasonable part. We spend a fair amount of time on the coal business. However, if you were to come to our headquarters and try to pick the 25 people who work on coal, everybody works on it a part of their time. We have some people, but it's -- and so the decision we took in order to reduce our manpower about 10% and curtail a number of other spending-related categories was really intended to meaningfully reduce that growth number so that if we were to sell the coal business and no longer have the allocation, that we wouldn't end up having a negative effect on our coke assets.

So -- and then we alter our media mix accordingly. And I would say we see significant movement in that mix on a year-to-year basis, as we get better at that.

There are investments that we had to make to recapture share of both that gross margin but again investing in some marketing programs to drive incremental growth in our business as well. So, it's hard to actual quantify and break out exactly what that impact was to overall European results except, I do want just reiterate again though that I mean overall our business in Europe in many countries was very, very good, and in addition to the strong growth that we had in certain countries and some of the uptake that we saw through the quarter in Germany, we will also continue to have opportunities though as we take a look at our Italy and Hungary businesses.

Just in terms of capital overall and we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment and if we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical as you'd said and also of course with our Mako technology.

With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers, and we're starting to see building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and then starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well.

GGG,Q1,2015,"And Pat, maybe just following up there. How do you think about the risk of getting into a new organic growth vertical, be it oil and gas and natural gas at this point? And how do you think about the return hurdles and expected payback as you start to invest more into that vertical?","Yes, if I look at Graco and I say look, we got a great machine and if we can get revenue in the top, we are going to make a lot of money. And we need some new places to go and apply our skill set. So I'm excited about the fact that we're getting into new spaces. Our timing wasn't great in terms of the two deals that we did in oil and gas, if you just take a look at what we paid and then what happened in the marketplace. On the other hand, they weren't big. They didn't break the bank. And the slowdown here in the end market, although it's going to be negative from a revenue standpoint, it's going to take us some time to get our manufacturing investments in place and to get the incremental sales force in place, identify some new product opportunities and do some of the things we want to do with these businesses. So I don't anticipate that we're going to go out and be paying crazy prices for oil and gas assets right now. But I do think that the work that we're going to do over the next year or two to improve those businesses is going to be probably good timing for when the market comes back. So again, I tend not to look in reverse too much, just look forward. And I think it's going to be good in the long run.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
NWSA,Q2,2011,"And a questions from Mr. Carey, you know you talked about retooling your businesses for a digital world, and its seems like there is a, maybe it’s not a new business, but it tweak to the existing industry practice that’s makes a lot sense to me, I just love to get your reaction, your affiliate fees are all charged on a per household basis, which makes it expensive for peoples who live alone to watch Television relative to families. It also sort of exposes you to piracy as you go down this authentication model, where people could sort of share passwords with one another, why wouldn’t be industry sort of move to an affiliate fee per connected device and sort of make TV more affordable for singles and extract more money from families with five TVs and three iPads and also sort of limit the piracy risk from this authentication model that’s emerging?","Well, I guess two different questions. I mean, I think on a per device range, I think actually in some degree, I mean like DirecTV that you do have, we don’t as a channel provider, but you take DirecTV, I think that you have a per device, because you need a set top box, so they can charge, so they can change you 5 or 6 bucks for, and I think actually cable guys, now they are moving to digital unless to an analog you just plug it in.

GLW,Q2,2013,"And a quick follow up. On specialty materials, it looks like the revenue outlook was a little softer than most expected. Can you address if it’s an inventory correction related issue? Or is it weaker demand given the deceleration in tablets and to some extent in smartphones? And any update you might have for us on auto?","On auto, I don’t have any update for Gorilla at this stage. Relative to Gorilla for consumer electronics, we have been working hard on modeling the supply chain, and we believe that there was excess inventory built up by a number of customers from the fourth quarter. And that’s being worked off this year. And then the second thing, of course, is that we have seen yield improvements in the supply chain over the course of the year. So those two things have been maybe reflected in what you perceive as the softer demand for Gorilla. If you take those out, looking at the amount of Gorilla being pulled from the supply chain to go into phones and tablets going to retail, we think it’s growing nicely. Obviously it always depends somewhat on model launches in the phone business, but that’s what’s affecting it.

If you have sort of the seasonally strongest quarters in second, third -- second quarter and third quarter, but you're guiding for moving cash flow positive in fourth quarter. What's sort of the missing piece there? Is it just that you expect cost to be materially lower in fourth quarter, relative to as you move through the year and the cost sort of rolled over? Is that what it is?"," Well, I'm saying that there is actually a high amount -- a relatively high amount of drydocks that were scheduled for Q3, relative to Q4. So Q3 will be the top quarter for us from an operational-performance standpoint. But it won't be the top performance from a cash-flow standpoint because we've got a few drydocks scheduled in Q3.

CTIC,Q4,2012,"And because of the endpoint change, would there be any potential for the data to come any earlier?","We would hope so because if we were able to switch to progression-free survival, it leaves with substantial decrease in sample size from 350 down to the range of 200, 220. That would still make this a very large trial in this disease, in this patient population. So it would still be a very robust data set. And we're going to be in the process, as we said, about getting additional EU sites now that we're also launching the drug commercially in the EU, and hoping that those EU sites will help us boost accruals so that we could complete the study more quickly than under the current design. With regards to the GI adverse events, the most common side effects are diarrhea, the second is nausea. These GI side effects tend to occur within the first month of treatment. So 89% of the patients that have been exposed to pacritinib had experienced some diarrhea within the first month. Because there's an opportunity to assess early, these patients. And in the clinical protocols, the patients will be contacted by their sites and asked, if they're using a formal script, whether or not there's any change in the GI symptoms. And that will allow the sites to give them specific instructions with regards to what additional medications they will take. It will also be given at the time they start the medication, a prescription for IMODIUM or some comparable anti-diarrheal, and with the instructions to start taking that medication in the event that they have any problems. So those patients whom the clinicians are concerned about, if the possible risk of diarrhea might seem to be higher or the responsiveness of the patients to taking medicine might be decreased, those patients could be instructed to take the IMODIUM prophylactically just as they start the therapy. This kind of aggressive management was not done in Phase I, understandably, because it was trying to elucidate the toxicity profile of the drug overall. So it's only as you get to the Phase II experience that you start to see a difference in terms of the presentation of GI side effects. The most recent example we have from publication would be the lymphoma study that is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September in which patients with lymphoma were dosed with pacritinib up to 600 milligrams, well above our 400-milligram per day dose in myelofibrosis. No Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicities were observed. So the GI toxicity is predictable. It's on target due to FLT3 and it's well managed by standard agents that the clinicians and patients are both very familiar with.",2.0,1.0,0,0.0,2.0,1.0

The easiest example of a subscription service is our eSupport product, which we sell an annual license to and then recognize revenues monthly or quarterly for it.

NAFC,Q4,2007,And do you expect most of the costs to be spread evenly throughout the course of the year or do you think most of these initiatives will be more in the second half of the year?,"Well, they are going to build throughout the year as we layer on additional projects. However, there is a little bit offsetting effect because there is others such as the Avanza in Omaha. I mean we felt some of that in the fourth quarter. We are going to feel some more of it in the first quarter. Well, that ought to begin to wane by say the third quarter but then we are going to have others that are layering on.

So because of the fact, Karen, that we are layering these things on starting projects in the first and the second and third, we are going to see that those costs are going to build throughout the year. But again, I still remain steadfast with the fact that I believe that by the time we end the year we will have inked out a slight improvement and we'll still have fully absorbed those costs even though your point is very valid, they will build throughout the year.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

We believe that what we have today, after this transformation – and really this transformation has been planned for a long, long time – we always review it. We made a major commitment, and with the investments in China, we got basically a huge new factory there. It just didn’t make sense for us to have two similar type of factories, one in Malaysia and one in China, when we feel that one can provide the solution. And also, I think it’s important to understand type of product that we build; these are really – we’re driving to advance printed circuit boards that we can compete on some of these things even from North America. So we’ve been investing heavily in our North American operations that provide for a unique technology. So we feel comfortable with what we have today. We’ve be tuning these things up.

You want them to be accretive, you said, over the long term. Does that mean the first full calendar year that the company has integrated? Are you looking for expansion of geographic footprint? I mean, give us a sense of how you think about these really quickly.","Yes, I'd say that there are a couple of factors that we look at. One is to the extent that it allows us to get into the geography that we think will be very difficult for us to get into, and it's also the significant opportunity that's a big positive. So eLong, for example, in China, we didn't think we could get a position in China as strong as eLong through organic growth. And while eLong had a tough time in its first couple of years, it's really turned around behind the new management team. And I'd say we're very happy that we have a position there. So one is large geographies that we don't think we can get proper scale then through typical organic growth, that's one. The second is if there's a new piece of technology or a new product that we think is an attractive product. Example there is Venere in the agency hotel market that we wanted to penetrate in Europe. It got us in there much more quickly. We're expanding that product in Europe as well as certain other areas of the world. And then the third or just kind of our big growth areas, we love media businesses that we can add to the TripAdvisor team.

So we’re always looking for new opportunities to find efficiency and drive savings. And again, we will talk more about that when we give 2017 guidance.

And it's easy for us if we reactivate the project to activate the project financing. So in terms of impacting the CapEx, we had more CapEx than expected in '21, in fact. It's why we went a little above the 13 [ph] by the way, on the Upstream part but no in '22.

I have no problem to have -- if gearing is going down, it's good for us. We'll have a reserve of cash for benefit -- to be countercycle when we have to be countercycles. So but again, on the answer is more for me it's not one, again, the other is shareholder distribution. We showed -- I think I told you we were at 33%. I guided you towards the 40%. So you can see the range of it. And if there's more to come. At this stage, we consider it will be to deleverage the company. And that's another maybe -- I'm sure, mistake we should not do is believing that we are entering into a long high cycle. Each time we have said that the year after, it's a catastrophe. So I'm very prudent on this part. Because it's obvious if price remain high, you will have more investors and more oil coming and it takes 2, 3 years but then you have the impact.

In the meantime, the best is to strengthen the company and to be ready then to use the balance sheet because opportunities will come in the different energies. And it might be a way, by the way, opportunities come to accelerate the transition.",2.0,2.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
DGII,Q3,2018,"And just because it’s a large pharmacy chain I’m assuming drugs, medication, temperature monitoring which also could do front of the stores with some of the food cases and whatnot, so are there expansion opportunities within these accounts or is this pretty much one is done, once it’s deployed that’s going to be the recurring you get and you want to revisit RPM another sites of the shop later?","David that’s a very keen question, you know we think there is great opportunity actually both within the pharmacy as well as in the front of the store. In a pharmacy it’s mainly a temperature application, but as some pharmacies do compounding, differential pressure is a key attribute as well as humidity sensors so there is additional sensor opportunities. And of course front of the store, they have got a gateway installed, they can leverage that gateway and have more incremental expense associated with covering their store rather than an entirely new implementation.

But we have been fortunate in one sense, the Avid business which we haven't mentioned so far has been pretty solid for us in light of a soft marketplace, a home marketplace that is. So we are still growing at a healthy double-digit rate albeit a little lower than it was a year ago but its still very healthy and we review that pretty carefully which says the high end of the consumer market is still opening up their wallets and still providing us ample opportunity.

So at the end of the period, we see a little bit more pressure in certain areas, but we've provided for those from a budgeted perspective in the way that we built our numbers and the way we've built our plans for 2008 and I'll continue to emphasize that our commitment to the marketplace was to eke out a very small fractional hairline improvement in EBITDA rate while at the same time fully absorbing all of these strategic costs and our transition costs and we manage that as we go. I mean in some cases we don't always know what the costs is going to be but that's just management. Sometimes you have to manage one part of your business to offset something else and to make it all pull out the right way.

I think one of the things where we're seeing a lot of growth now is actually in the higher-value products. We had really growth we felt very good about in our BRMS, our rules management, our SOA platform as well. Fuse actually we just announced, as I talked about, that ESB product under the JBoss brand, and those are higher dollar deals. And now we actually have a number of big companies, you know their name well, that are willing to standardize on JBoss as their Middleware platform, where historically it's just been the application server.

We know in this late line setting, as you described, many of these patients will have progressed through several hormonal therapies earlier in treatments. It's not uncommon for hormonal agents to be reintroduced in a late line. Obviously, these patients have relatively few treatment options on certainly I think when we think about how elacestrant could perform in this late line setting or how we've seen it perform in our ongoing phase 1 study, again against patients that have previously received these endocrine agents, I think we feel very encouraged by Elacestrant’s potential.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

It's a very different device focused on cartridge versus reagents, focused on drops of blood versus vials of blood. It's a device that has a much reduced need for calibration versus the existing technology today. So there's a number of things there and we will highlight that device at the May investor conference.

They haven't... they haven't made any avert signals to go into two tier distribution, but if you are reviewing everything and I suspect you are reviewing everything and at some point they may surprise us all but at this stage there is nothing else we can say because there is nothing else that we are aware of that they are doing in two tier right now.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

DGII,Q3,2018,"And one last question on solutions. I guess it's probably a little dangerous and misleading to look at things necessarily on a per site basis depending on what the hardware mix looks like versus managed services, but could you give us an idea of what the pipeline looks like. Is there some way to give us at least qualitatively if not quantitatively how big that pipeline looks like in terms of the number of sites, number of RFPs out there, otherwise some color on that front and is there a big financial difference in terms of the different verticals, and ultimate implementation whether we talking about transportation, pharma or otherwise? Thanks.","Yes. Let me remind people this is a $3.5 billion TAM so there is a large opportunity. The vast majority, well over 95% of that TAM is recording this information manually, typically using old fashion pen and paper. And so we are eventualizing in many cases the advantages of automated monitoring, pattern recognition, better decision-making. And so that the human elements is the factor that is the one that we've got to convert more so then the technology and does this work if you will and other benefits. And so as we think about the pipeline the level of interest continues to grow, I mean we've got enough pipeline to more than satisfy our needs and represents more than the number of installations that we even have. The pace of which the market goes from interest and piloting to convergent of rollout is varying and you're seeing us having some more success with transportation, transportation tends to have the lower side of the ARPU with trailers and trucks, the ARPUs there stronger with warehouses and distribution facilities. And we are also seeing some real success in healthcare where there is tremendous benefits, there are value goods, the penalties are more severe for non-compliance, so you are seeing us have success with hospitals and pharmacies and clinics. The food side equation, cash management becomes a real critical part of the value proposition and you're affecting store operation and it’s a more complex implementation, so you're seeing food be deliberate in their evaluation and implementation. But if you look at the large opportunity in front of us, we are really excited that we can grow this business, confidently to 50 to 100 million just what the pipeline that we've got in front of us.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

As I think I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, Radius does have a lot of experience in conducting osteoporosis studies, some based on BMD endpoints, some based on fracture end points. So this is a study population that we understand well. We’ve conducted many studies.

RRD,Q4,2012,"And secondly, the news about USPS stopping the Saturday delivery. I mean, does that have a big impact on you at all? And if you could give us some color around that.","I think the bigger news here is what you said on your second question, when you want to go ahead and talk about postal. And just to frame that question a little bit to see why we're excited about our logistics business, if you think about what the USPS has gone through since 2006, they've basically reduced 200,000 employees. They've consolidated 200 mailing centers, and they've reduced hours in 13,000 post offices. Any of these actions that we, as business leaders in the world, if we would have took them, then we thought we would have seen great results of taking such restructuring. But it hasn't occurred, and not to put blame on the post office, not to put blame on the United States government, but society has evolved in how we communicate with each other. But now is the time to address it. None of us can simply ignore the problem that the post office is faced with. The industry accounts for 8 million jobs and is roughly 7% of our GDP. It has a significant impact on our economy. All of us can look at the post office's pre-funding of the retirement benefits, and I think it's $5.5 million annually they have to pay to the Treasury. You can point to the United States Postal Service overpaying its obligation to the Civil Service Retirement System by $50 billion, while the $7 billion overfunded to the Federal Employees Retirement System. All of these 3 are valid areas impacting the financial health of the United States Postal Service. But what can get done about it? I mean, the USPS is, by far, the best delivery mechanism, most cost-effective for less mile. USPS touches every household business and institution on a daily basis, and it is a trusted brand. So that's sort of the backdrop. Where there's challenges, there's opportunities, and for us, we're uniquely positioned to assist customers to deliver their communications from both a physical and electronic standpoint. RR Donnelley handles the sorting, transportation, and we've got an unparalleled logistics network. We already touch more than half of the standard mail in this country. So the answer is not whether or not we fix the overpayments that the post office has made or whether we go 6 to 5 days. It's going to be how can USPS have a step change and even operate even more efficiently than it does today, and that is where we think RR Donnelley's opportunity is. Our logistics is -- when you consider the actions that's going to be taken over the next 2 years by the USPS, coupled with all the communication material and packaging we have running through our facilities, our logistics business even becomes more important to RR Donnelley and our investors. We are well positioned to assist the USPS in their transformation and, at the same time, help our customers. The acquisition that we did that we talked to you about, the commingling facility, those acquisitions, that's what we're going to continue to look for because we've got to continue to look to mitigate the cost increases for our customers. If the USPS gives all of our industry time to go ahead and figure out 6 to 5 days, we're all going to figure it out. But if not, then we think our platform is better situated if it does come upon us quicker than people might expect, which our competitors might not be in the same spot.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

We only had one competitor out in the CIS region that did not increase prices. So what happened in the back half of the year was the combination of pricing coming down on natural rubber and then also just the ability to pass through some of those cost increases.

Accelerated is really the product we lead with, its machine-to-machine, more of a rugged industrialized application, Digi is the lead product.

HAE,Q4,2014,"And then Chris, can you help us at all think through the key drivers of earnings for 2014 to 2015? Obviously you've got several headwinds in terms of the ARC contract loss, some other whole blood pricing, incremental variable comp. On a positive side you've got a tailwind for manufacturing. Is there anything else that I'm missing there and can you help us quantify what the relative impact of those items are?","Sure. Let me recap some of the elements from the script. So in the category of headwinds we have about $11 million from currency yen pricing or yen - devaluation of yen revenues. We have about $9 million of incremental bonus year-over-year, so just comparison of one year to the next has that as a funding requirement and we have between $25 million and $30 million of headwinds from the North American business which is a combination of pricing provided in advance of VCC initiatives to win the HemeXcel business. It's some volume loss which in effect impacts the absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs and it’s just the flat out loss of the ARC business and the profitability of that. So those are the combination of headwinds, in the aggregate we’ve sized for you in the $50 million to $55 million range. We had ongoing VCC initiatives; we accelerated some of those items and also implemented other transformational restructuring activities in response to the market conditions and generated about $30 million of savings. But obviously you can only -- there's a practical limit on what you can do in those circumstances without impacting the real growth drivers of the business. And it’s a question of that the muscle of the business if you will. And so those are the sort of net headwinds and tailwinds from a profitability perspective. We reinvested the contribution from the growth drivers which I said were $40 million to $50 million of revenue in the growth initiatives that we have in emerging markets and plasma so that we’re keeping them moving forward.

And then the comments that you made about cover glass for phones and tablets increasing about 30% year over year, but you have yield improvements and inventory heading into the year. I’m trying to circle that back to your previous guidance, I think, that Gorilla Glass would grow double digits year over year. Could you help us perhaps narrow that range between double digits and 30%?","I guess I would say that when we look at the amount of inventory and the amount of yield issues, that have occurred for this year, that we would have thought that the demand for Gorilla on us would be greater. And when we adjust for those two things, we would say that there definitely is greater than 30% growth, but those two items have harmed us, if you do a comparison year over year.",1.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0
FISV,Q4,2010,"And then I just want to ask about the operational effectiveness of $25 million. I guess that's kind of below last year's objective of $40 million, and I know the goal is, over five years, $250 million. So can you just help us understand, is that number get greater as we go forward?
","And Bryan, the other consideration on that is, if you go back and look at how we paced in the $270 million or so that we have adjusted our structure for, including the CheckFree synergies, you saw that build. I think it actually started around $15 million or so, then that built up to a crescendo and then it begins to tail off. And that's really what's been going on that $44 million -- right, is actually I think less than it was last year. And that number will -- maybe something. But remember, that whole $270 million is now built into our cost structure, and then this new $250 million is additive to that. So by the end of this five-year period, we'll have actually adjusted our cost structure by over $500,000,000 assuming that we get this right. So they're just different streams that, that $25 million, to Tom's point, will grow to be in much larger level. And then that two will tail off. It doesn't mean they're going away. It just means there is no incremental saves. These are all incremental saves each year.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

","Yes, it will continue to build, Bryan. And that really is the same number that we presented on Investor Day, so that $25 million, because the next area of savings in the $250 million comprises of data center transformation and a number of other areas. But that $25 million ramps up significantly to year two to over $50 million. We're not giving guidance on that right now. But clearly, it's going to ramp up, and we have our plans. We're executing alone those plans and continue to refine those to accelerate as much of that as we can into 2011, keeping in mind the quality of our delivery and pacing that correctly over the next few years.

LTRX,Q3,2015,"And then I know you guys have some early nice partnerships or relationships with Verizon, Medtronic, NetApp. Can you just comment on how those are progressing and if you’re seeing additional traction in that each of those customers?","Sure. So a key part of our go-to-market strategy is to engage with tier 1 accounts to develop new products. And typically we see early revenue from those tier 1 accounts such as the one that you mentioned and then we push it out into our foreign retail channels on a worldwide basis. So we’re still very encouraged to work with those customers. Many of those customers place large orders on a lumpy category. Some quarters they're strong, some quarters they are not.

OCX,Q1,2020,And then I was wondering if you guys would be willing to share any numbers around test volumes that you’ve seen since the launch of RX? I know because of the accounting principles we’re probably not going to see it reflected accurately in the numbers.,"Yes. Thomas, we had – we wanted to begin to give guidance on that at this quarter and obviously we didn’t expect the COVID pandemic. It’s a little hard to give you a real good trajectory given that we just now are starting to ramp back up even though we saw steady flow of connections to physicians and samples came in during the COVID, the worst part of that pandemic. Today, we’re just now starting to engage a lot of the places we brought on board during the virtual onboarding and we’re starting to see physicians start to order. Our goal obviously is to ramp up every site and have ordering physicians at every site. We do expect that will take a little while once we are able to engage them physically. We want to go behind these onboarding activities and we want to be able to then recruit the actual physicians within those sites that are ready to order and get them and encourage them to order. So today, we gave the number 17 patients that we had actually identified as positive that had changed their course of therapy. So that number we were public with today. So if you assume that about somewhere around 20% to 30% of the patient population that we see will be positive, you can kind of get to a number and that number is only reflective of what we were able to do during the pandemic. What I committed to everyone and we’ll continue to reiterate is at the end of Q2, once we have a much greater understanding of how – what the long-term impact of COVID is going to be, we will give you sort of a target for the end of the year in terms of what patient population that we think we can touch.",1.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape right now?"," You know I love our marketplace and it's growing. It's a healthy business. It's fragmented. I don't think the intensity really has changed. I do I have seen what you've seen as well most retailers are reporting strength in that category.
What I like is our position to compete we're a value retailer. We provide a treasure hunt solution to shopping. We've got the lowest prices out there that’s the one I'm most proud of honestly. We're still proud of our prices we've put all of our assortment on online so you can see it on pricing transparency.
The direct sourcing an effort that we're putting in is going to allow us to take prices even lower. And I would tell you our model is a model that makes it very difficult for others to duplicate. We can value engineer, styles that are out there and over 70% of our product is private label.
I would tell you over 80% of our sales are full price and that’s full prices are below other people sales price. We've got a self-help labor model in the stores they’re low cost structure very low real estate costs go low Home Office cost and D.C. and occupancy cost. We keep cost structure tight. So that enables us to have these great prices.
So yes the marketplace there is a lot of great competition out there. I'm impressed with what they're doing with comp shop every single month, every single one of our competitors. We're staying very close to it give an example.
Our most recent comp shop we’re 40% below Amazon sales prices. We're really pleased with that. We continue to pay attention to the online players as well as the brick and mortar players. And I love our competitive position and will continue to focus on that.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

Of the $80 million, we're not -- as I mentioned in the script, I really don't want to get into a year-over-year update, but we're making a lot of strong progress. I feel as good as I could feel sitting here looking at 2011 and looking at us making considerable traction towards delivering that $80 million in three years.

A, is that appropriate? Is that correct? And B, what's driving that, and can we expect that to continue in the next year?","Yes, what we stated was in Q4 versus Q3, that our operating profit would be up $10 million versus prior year. So that is continued growth. We mentioned that we see from our sequential basis, Q4 versus Q3, and while we still see the revenue down, it should continue to improve. And we are pleased with the progress that we're making from a bottom line standpoint. The focus really has been around creating effectiveness and efficiency across every area of the organization. We have streamlined our overall cost structure from a selling standpoint. We are continuing to focus around supply chain.

HOME,Q4,2017,And then a quick second question. You spoke about direct sourcing and how that's rolling in? Can you talk about how you would expect the cost profile of that business to evolve as the program seasons? Also as you think about hitting trends what your lead times looks like for directly source products versus party source from third-party providers?," So in terms of our direct sourcing, I said in our prepared remarks that we brought product in late last year. We're going to see the benefits of it in the second half of the year as inventory turns. And we're pleased with the landed cost as it came in.
It's already in the stores and we're starting to see some of the filters associated with it. It's smaller now it will build as we move through the year. Overall, lead time will depend on the product we're buying. So if were buying furniture it's going to be longer, if it's going to be textiles we have more flexibility overall and it’s going to be shorter timeframes. But the good news is, as we are in the very early and in sourcing. We have a team in place that can execute what we need to do not only for this year, but also for next year and we'll continue to invest into that team.
We see this as a five year journey where we can drive lot of benefits that will give us the ability to reinvest in the business. And as you've seen over the past five years we are committed to doing that. But what you've also seen is, if you go back and look at the last four fiscal years, we've seen 150 basis point increase in operating margin over those four fiscal year despite 70 basis points of incremental marketing investment, 40 basis points of incremental store labor investment as well as other investments in our home office.

TAP,Q3,2008,And then as we’re looking at pension expenses and pension funding going forward,"Sure. Let me give you a couple pieces. I mean, it’s hard to give a very precise answer here, because obviously with the current equity performance levels expense and expense will likely be higher next year. It’s very difficult to say precisely what number that will be, and I just can tell you from previous years this stuff moves around a lot, obviously while equity may be down, discount rate is up, and it’s very difficult for me to give you any guidance around that. And my best advice is to wait until year end. As it relates specifically to cash requirements of the pension plans, those are driven mostly by various regulatory bodies. In the case certainly of Canada and UK that’s a bit of a triennial valuation. And depending on where that falls, that may or may not drive increased contributions. And I’d say the last thing, which is a moderating factor for us is that the last couple of years we have been gong through a process of trying to de-risk those pension plans by shifting assets from equity-based instruments into fixed income instruments. So mix all that together and you’ll have to wait really until the end of the year to get a better picture of what that will look like. Bryan, the thing I would add is the de-risking that we did was before the recent sharp declines in the equity markets.",2.0,0.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0

And then do you win, are you winning that from larger competitors or is it smaller competitors? And then I guess kind of another element to that is a slower market or one that we're in? Does it, is it more conducive to gaining share?","I would say, yes. Certainly, the offering of the component side of the business helped us gain share in many times, if you can get that business, a lot of the other products that go into the home will follow. I don't, I think we're taking share from Big and small competitors. There's definitely a market by market situation. But there's no doubt in my mind that enhancing our value add proposition creates additional opportunities to grow share.

There's clearly been a kind of market proof of concept of group sales, flash sales, but there's an open question as whether that gets all verticalized, you should have a highly qualified customer base. How big do you think that opportunity is, and can you just walk through some of the simple economics of how you make money on SniqueAway?","Mark, I'd be happy to go through the opportunity as the business matures a little bit. I think in general, if you look at major platforms that have been introduced in the e-commerce space and in travel in general, the core of the introduction of a significant platform has been the opportunity for people to save money. Originally, when we came onto the scene, hotels.com was on the scene, we were offering merchant rates below rack rates. Then the Internet became the rack rate, so to speak. So opaque models got introduced. Priceline, the Hotwires of the world, the dynamic package business, which allow you to save money. Those were kind of, call it, a second leg of growth for the business. And I think that these flash sales, what you see going on now, these new retail concepts could be a third leg because again, they offer consumers a chance to save significant amounts. SniqueAway is kind of a toe in the water for us. It's being introduced with the Smarter Travel team inside of TripAdvisor, which is a terrific team. And we've introduced it to a small percentage of our email database, which is frankly huge database, really with inventory focused on the East Coast now. And then over the next months, we're going to expand the inventory to the south, to the west, et cetera and build the concept. Early results are very good. We're getting fan mail from our hotel partners, and consumers love it as well. So I'd say the early results are very good, but this is a long journey. It's a very new concept, and we're not ready to declare whether it's long-term, how large it's going to be or exactly what the opportunity is going to be.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

","Yes. So there is $2 million that weren’t originally in the guidance for the year, so that's certainly an impact. And then the other impact is what is just appearing in gross margin, which is a lower-than-expected gross margin as compared to what we had contemplated at beginning of the year. There is a couple of dynamics, one is the manufacturing transition is taking longer and so that's impacting our operating expense associated with our cost of goods. The other aspect is the supply chain for electronics is under tremendous pressure. It started in the memory areas when a couple of large providers did not expected last time buys and that had a ripple effect. As far as into certain capacitors and even some cases resistors so there has been some hoarding going on and so our ability to get our allocations has been under pressure and has forced higher transportation costs as well as in some cases higher component costs. So the combination was two, we really had the biggest impact on gross margin being up this quarter about 200 or more basis points and giving us reason to be cautious even in the current quarter.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

AAPL,Q2,2009,"And then finally I guess one for Peter, quickly in response to one of the other questions, you talked about considerations for margins in terms of forces that work to the degree that you can – can you help give us a bridge in terms of your thinking whether it’s qualitatively or quantitatively about how we think about 36.4% gross margins this quarter to 33% next quarter, can you rank order the forces, can you explain and then rank order the forces in terms of their impact on that expected deceleration?","Yes on the – and I will say the larger two out of three are the stronger US dollar and seasonally lower mix driven largely by the beginning the education buying season. Let me talk about each of those. Regarding the dollar, the dollar is all but stronger today than where it was throughout most of the March quarter. But the – the bigger impact for us on a sequential basis regarding the dollar is our hedges. In our December and March quarter, we had the hedges in place that we’re put in place at the time that the dollar was not as strong and the hedges that we have in place for the June quarter largely we will put in place during March at stronger dollar levels and that’s really what is the – is really the driving factor behind the sequential impact of the dollar. And of course the ed buying season begins in the June quarter and June tends to be more dominated by K-12s than High Eds. The September quarter historically is stronger for High Eds than for K-12. And K-12 being more of an institutional sale and we expect to be competitive this year especially given the funding situation that tend to strike.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

We are really pushing, Barbara mentioned in her comments we're really pushing to a SaaS model. We want to exclusively sell in that venue but there are certain customers in fact very large ones who sometimes prefer to purchase on a perpetual bait and so we don't limit ourselves and walk away from business but we're really moving in that direction.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

There's some front end sort of weather-related questions but those are just normal for any kind of development in this part of the country. But really, it's expected to be just a pretty steady ramp-up. We'll drill -- we expect to drill probably about 100, 103 wells across the field in 2013 based off of the comment Steve made earlier on 4 rigs, and we've built that and their completions into that profile.

That product is going to be in the market in the next few weeks, so that was a really big hit at the event last Thursday. We'll be shipping that product in volume before the end of the year and the marketing for both the TSA and the bike lock is very, very vertical. So it's an easier market to address and we think we're going to be very successful there. It's also global. As you know, bicycles are a basic mode of transportation in many countries around the globe and so attaching ourselves to the bicycle companies and those that promote that level of transportation will also be an important thing for us.

Obviously, there’s been discussion around increasing the corporate rate and also, the offshore earnings tax rate, which would impact us, but we’d want to understand if there’s any potential credits that could mitigate some of that increase.

Can you talk about the sequential increase in net interest expense and the year-over-year decline in free cash flow, and what you are expecting on interest expense and free cash flow on the back half of the year?","Yes, from an interest expense, it was really just driven by probably a more accelerated share purchase than we originally laid out.

RHT,Q3,2013,"And then just as a follow-up, Jim, I wanted to ask you on the OpenStack opportunity. Could you size it in terms of revenue potential in the next couple of years, just relative to what you think the revenue potential is for you in the storage and the virtualization arenas in the same time frame? Because we've been hearing a lot more about OpenStack, but I don't think there's a real clear understanding of the magnitude of the opportunity there.","Yes, I really wish I had a real crystal ball, right? We can give you a lot more on that at Analyst Day. What I would say is there's a significant potential in it. Obviously, in software-defined data center, long term there's going to be significant revenue. How fast that actually develops is another thing. We're working with a lot of early adopter customers on OpenStack, and there's a lot of interest in it. But until those things go into production, there just won't be big dollars. So I think if you look out, if you put a horizon 4 or 5 years, it could be much, much larger than the Linux market for sure. But if you ask me over the next 12 months, I can't imagine there'll be material revenue, not just for us but for anyone. Because at that point, it's -- it'll all be POCs, just kind of working with customers to operationalize it and big checks don't start coming until things go into production.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

FISV,Q4,2010,"And then just final question, on ZashPay. Looks like you're charging, just on looking at the website, about $0.75 per transaction on your own website. But I'd just be curious to hear how you're seeing most of the FIs at this point price the product or, if most, are giving it away?","Chris, I will get to that e-bill question that I forgot to answer to. I got slapped by Tom for that. But on ZashPay, yes, on the consumer side, we are charging $0.75. But most of financial institutions right now are looking at this. They see it to be a very high-value solution. They think it's going to move into the kind of the daily habits of their consumers, and they see it as a way to build fee revenue. So most of the clients that we're talking to right now are looking at ways to either charge for it. Many of them have already implemented and are charging for the send element. And I've heard some clients talk about, well, if you use a debit card x number of times, they'll let you have Zash transactions. So there are a variety of ways that you can bundle these solutions to try to create more value for clients. So my guess is it's going to become a fee generating item, and I think it will actually be quite helpful over the next several years for financial institutions as they look for that fee revenue. Just a quick comment on the e-bill. We continue to think e-bill is critical, not just for the fact that it unlocks growth, but it's ordinarily differentiating us as it relates to bill payment experience. Tom, I think, mentioned that we are investing in our Biller area and through our SmartConnect product. And so we are investing there. You'll hear more about that over the next year, and we are maniacally focused on unlocking some of the value that exists there. You may remember, we've got, call it, $100 million of embedded latent revenue that's sitting there. And it's a fixed cost business, so there's a lot of opportunity there.

ODP,Q3,2010,And then just on Florida and California. I think California was the big turn. Could you just talk a little bit what you're seeing in California from the delivery side and also the retail side that suggests that sequential improvement relative to Q2?,"I'll take the retail piece and let Steve address BSD. I still think and if you look at California and Florida for the Retail business, it's roughly 25% of our fleet of stores. If you look at unemployment in California and Florida, it's still running about 24% or more, higher than the national average. I think the stores in California are well known. There's still a furlough that I think is in place in public government there. So I don't think California is out of the wood. That being said, for Retail in the third quarter, students and parents don't need to do back-to-school shopping. They still need the supplies to allow their students to go back-to-school equipped. And we did I think a good job, not only advertising the products that we had available for sale. We have attractive price points. And we were fortunate that when shoppers came in our stores, we were able to convert them to buyers. So we're pleased with the results in California. I think, we said they were slightly positive for the quarter. I don't know that, that's necessarily a telltale sign of what to expect in the future.

What's your approach to the cost structure in Industrial for '13?","Well, there's a couple of things. One is, we're still bullish on Nitrogen Gas Products as a whole. Long term, we have very good view on our Heinz Hanggi business because of the emergence of the gas direct injection technology.

Thanks.","Sure. So I’ll take the last question first again. The Apple, first of all, we're not hearing from customers. Keep in mind that we don't focus on the, so to speak, the device dedication, consumer device authentication market as you know Touch ID and facial recognition or face ID our focus, so we don't do that. That's number one. Number two, the input and feedback that we will get and certainly are getting from our enterprise customers is that they're not using facial recognition technology for authentication. That's a fact. So you're not going to see some of our typical and classic customers that are buying our finger scanners that are buying our software, change and put cameras or use existing cameras that they have on their PCs and laptops for facial recognition. First, keep in mind that the camera that's utilized in the facial ID or face ID deployed is a very special device. And so it's an infrared camera that has all other types of functionality to try to make it more accurate. You’re typical in-classic camera that comes on your laptop, your notebook or your tablet PC does not have that capability and so we're not going to see that deployed in enterprise at least in this generation. I mean, who knows what will happen five and ten years from now. I think it's hard to say. I think there will be other modes of biometrics that we're looking at right now. We believe that passive behavioral biometrics are going to be a really strong contender going forward, for not only mobile devices but also for tablets PCs, notebooks and so forth. So, there are other technologies that we see have, we think, greater viability long term. Very difficult to be in the movie theater and have to hold the phone up to your face to unlock it that if you want to be on the subway or be on 9th Avenue in New York City, take your $1000 device out and hold it in front of your face. All these things, do you want to be driving in your car and have to again position your face or look the other way to unlock the phone. So all these things are going to come up, they're all going to be discussed, they're all going to be reviewed. I think the technology is wonderful. It's convenient, but whether it will get pervasive use and whether Apple will decide to put the finger scanner back in the device over the next year will all be determined by them.

We look at a little less than a couple $100 million that we would have had a tailwind on. This time a year, we're almost always increasing our leverage ratio. So it to drop, it's pretty remarkable and obviously 1.8 turns versus last year is indicative effect. As far as normal, I think we've been pretty committed to the idea of debt pay down and de-risking, but in that 2.5 to 3.5 range, we're not afraid. I would say to fall out of the bottom of that range, if it means we're building dry powder if we can't find those deals, but as we indicated, as we took action on this year, or this quarter, there are some good yields out there. And we will continue to snatch those up where we think it makes sense. And we're getting a good value for our money. I think we're in a bit of a sweet spot now. No question if the price of commodities runs back up, we will see growth in working capital as a result and definitely.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GERN,Q3,2012,"And then maybe just a couple of questions on 1005 and I'll jump in the queue. On intracranial responses that'll be measured here, where does the FDA stand in terms of intracranial responses as an endpoint?","They've never had cause to opine with regards to the status of intracranial responses as an approvable endpoint. The 2 drugs that have been developed for brain metastases in the last decade have not used intracranial response as an endpoint. So if any -- if a company has approached the FDA with questions about intracranial response rate as an approvable endpoint, that data has never been made public.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,And then maybe just one other one asking the question with respect to your pricing in other way. If you guys were to become more aggressive with your own pricing would that really change your revenue outlook means for you over the next couple of quarters given it's more elongated sales cycles and discussion and larger deal size in the shift -- should I guess the concern is what is in the six month time we're talking about gross margin in the low 60s because this is a new industry environment. Do you or not you not see that as a risk right now?,"Now I think -- I still feel very comfortable in the target gross margin model we have used. There's still a lot of room between where we operate and what the target model looks like. I also want to underscore, we have very strong win rates in the high end. It just happens to be the win rates are different from what we have enlisted 100K deals, the half a million dollar deal. So we have very strong win rates on the high end and the pricing is not fundamentally stopping our progress. I answered an earlier question by saying our growth rate in larger deals, growth rate in Fibre Channel are all above the company growth rate. And so that still making really good progress. I'm not at a point where I feel like we have to abandon our gross margin model at all. We very much feel that we can maintain that gross margin model.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GERN,Q3,2012,"And then maybe one final one. Can you talk about the relative distribution of 1005 to the brain, what results systemically?","The -- I don't have very good information for you about the relative concentrations in tissues outside the brain versus inside the brain in humans. What I can tell you is that at the doses and schedule that we're using in the Phase II program, the concentrations of 1005 inside the brain and particularly in tumors inside the brain is in double-digit micromolar concentrations, which is way in excess of what is required for anti-tumor activity.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
VSH,Q3,2011,"And then my follow-up is, as we look at tantalum pricing typically if my memory is correct, it’s this time of year when the tantalum powder company start looking at contracting pricing for the future year out, is that the case now? And what type of pricing are we looking at for 2012 versus 2011? Because I believe 2011 was up pretty sharp versus 2010. What type of price of tantalum should we be considering for your cost of good sold increase and are you back in the market or you have to have quite a bit of inventory you’re still having – that you can go through?","We did not believe in the shortages since a long time. We never believe the story with the shortage and therefore we don’t have so much inventory as well and this is not the environment for substantial price increases in tantalum powder, I would say.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
SXC,Q1,2014,"And then on -- in terms of the sale of those coal assets, other companies in the industry have had the challenge in selling their metallurgical coal assets. If there -- if finding a seller is challenging, how would you -- is there still a path to exiting the business?","So finding a seller is not challenging, it's the buyer. I think that's what you're referring to. The -- I would say a couple of things. We will have an ultimate backup plan in the event that we're unsuccessful. I want to talk about our outlook in that regard. But I mean, our plan would be, if we're not successful, we would significantly downsize further in order to try to meet only the needs of the coke plant, and then over time, even rationalize that. So it just wouldn't be done immediately because in the end, we still need 1.05 million tons to go into the coke plants. And some reasonable portion of those tons need to come from -- should come from logistically the mines that are very close by. But the fallback plan would be to minimize the absolute level of adjusted EBITDA loss and cash that needs to be -- the cash that will be burned in the business, why you rationalize it over time. That's the fallback plan. Now the principal plan, if you think about it, we're surrounded by strategics. If we think about $110 of cash cost, which is -- and yet with our exit rated margin, with our goal really for 2014, we think that if our mines were combined with someone that had significant scale, they could take another chunk of cost out of the above ground cost, call it another $5 to $10 roughly, this is something I reviewed in Analyst Day. And then lastly, a more efficient per plant located better, in a better location to the mines, and probably another $10, which if we think about $90 of cash cost for deep room and pillar mid-vol coal is certainly a much more competitive level than we've been at. The asset itself, we have an offtake agreement that we could offer. We could do the prep plant and then offer it on an offtake basis and then put it into the MLP. And lastly, we're very flexible on structure of -- it's not like we need to do this transaction to raise cash, so we could take our consideration to multiple form. I think we've got, we've had quite a bit of inbound interest, but obviously, we need to be able to translate that into a transaction, so we're early in the process. But I think we believe we have both the assets and the opportunity and the openness to a transaction that would allow us to get this done, and that's what we're going to work on in 2014.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
GLW,Q2,2013,"And then on Gorilla, where you talked about the perceived softness there in the guidance. You commented on thin glass. Is that impacting the revenue growth levels in Gorilla, in particular if that’s causing you to get a lower ASP per square area? And then I also wanted to get an update on your expectations for 3D glass, if that’s something that is going to ship this year, and is going to be a meaningful contributor. And then lastly, it seems that Asahi’s Dragontrail is gaining some traction in the market and is starting to get used as a second source. Is that impacting your Gorilla expectations?","I don’t think Dragontrail is really impacting our expectations. Clearly we don’t have quite as strong a share as what we had originally, but it’s still extraordinarily high. I don’t have an update on 3D, so I’m sorry, I’m not current on whether we’re going to ship anything this year or not. I know the program is continuing to move ahead.",1.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0

So, your gross margin dollars per unit are actually equal to or higher than traditional watch here in the not too distant future. So, we're not as concerned about a unit shift.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
FOSL,Q1,2018,"And then on as you think about the percentage of the business becoming wearables over time, how do you see that?","Dana, on your mix question, it's always a little bit difficult to forecast because it relies on your forecasting, not only the growth in wearables, but also what happens in traditional watches. You can tell in the past two, three years we've grown to almost 20% of our mix is wearables product on it. So, you think about that, that's 5% to 10% mix growth or shift over the past three years. So just extrapolating that, you can do it about as well as we can. It's probably a similar amount of mix shift, between 5% and 10% over the next three years. So, you go from 20% to 25%, 30%, to 30%, 35%. So, it's going to kind of build and grow. It will be a third of our business going to maybe 40% of our business. The tough call is going to be exactly when, when will you get to those higher penetration points.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
FOSL,Q1,2018,"And then on as you think about the percentage of the business becoming wearables over time, how do you see that?","Well, we're going to find out. We're in position now with great capabilities for both the traditional and wearables. It's interesting that there's significant demand out there for wearables, business growing extremely quickly. It's an aspirational female customer, largely, which is our customer. They're very interested in the whole idea of connectivity and new innovation, so the potential's very significant. We have something like a 5% or 6% share globally of the watch business. If we get that of what's expected to be in wearables, a $33 billion business in three years, it could be a very significant business for us. So, we'll play it out. We'll see what happens. We're in a position where we're going to do as much as we can with innovation, design and execution on both traditional and wearables.

Can you help us get a sense of how big that market size is what the penetration rate is and what sort of share should we expect you to achieve?","Yes. That market is very nascent and early, so I would not, at this point, be able to put a market size on it. We've gotten some initial design wins that are first applications of our product to that space. So we've really got to go through that initial deployment and see where it sorts out before we could start to think about this as a market and a sizing and such.

FISV,Q4,2010,"And then second question is actually on e-bills, grew about 2% to 3% this year. How confident are you guys that, that growth rate can materially accelerate at some point either in '11 or '12 off of that base? And then with Wells taking their bill pay in-house, how do you think about the risk of other large FIs doing the same thing?","Sure. Those are great questions. I'm going to take the latter one first, then we'll come back. Wells Fargo did not take their bill pay business in-house. Wells Fargo, a number of years ago, spent significant money and built their own bill payment system. What they did is they bought Wachovia back in '08, I guess it was, or '09 now, early '09. And they planned all along to convert that. They began converting the Wachovia business over to their own proprietary system, and they plan to complete that in 2010. So that's what happened in that case. And as it relates to others, I mean, we're very close to -- not surprising, we're very close to what's going on in the market. Beyond Bank of America, which is a well known large client of ours, Wachovia was about a 1% client of ours, we have a handful of other clients, bill payment clients, that are, I'll call it, 0.5%. And then beyond that, there's little concentration, and even 0.5% is not material concentration. The great news is we have renewed, most of it, not all of those agreements, over the last 18 months and we feel quite comfortable with that base of clients. So from that standpoint, we don't see any current risks. So that's the good news.

Historically, that's been something that I've always tried to do either through a fuel hedge or fuel contract or both and we were able to do some of that in 2007. If we find an opportunity to do it in 2008, we will, but with the way that the barrel prices has been selling we haven't seen a logical opportunity to do that.

RDUS,Q4,2017,"And then second, you mentioned some non-clinical supportive studies that you need to run with the patch, maybe, could you just be a little bit more specific about what those studies are? And then I guess from a manufacturing standpoint, what sort of data and stability you need to provide to the FDA?","Yeah. Absolutely. So the supportive clinical and clinical study has really fallen to category of being sort of routine part of drug development. So, there are some additional preclinical dermal tolerance studies that we expect to conduct. Certainly, very routine studies, very clear guidance on what is expected for those studies. They're absolutely not rate limiting for our development path. I'm sorry, you had a second part to the question. Oh, stability.

HOME,Q4,2017,"And then secondly if you think about investing in-store labor so is that more hours, is it wages and benefits, training where does the bulk of that fall out this year?"," So what we love about our model it really affords us the opportunity to put fixed cost leverage back into our business every year and that through hours or rate or combination of both really. So we also are able to generate efficiencies and reallocate hours where it benefits our business and customers the most. So an example for that as we revised our shipment processing which allowed us to give hours back on to the sales floor to help fund for reinventions and other things that we did around patio also.
So we actually do not plan to leverage our store labor line each year. Over the past five years as Judd mentioned, we've actually delivered store labor by 40 basis points and we’ve reinvested in both the employee and the customer experience. We've added some examples were mentioned as we added the floor resources that are patio department and other projects to improve our customer experience.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
ODP,Q3,2010,"And then secondly, for Mike, when you look at the inventory dynamic, your inventory growth was a bit unfavorable to your sales trends. And that was, I believe, reversal of trends that we had seen, leading up to the certainty versus where we were last quarter. If you could give us a sense as to what contributed to that and kind of where inventory stand and where the inventory lives right now?","Actually, when we talk about flow in the quarter and the contribution to cash flow, we're actually really pleased with the inventory levels. If you look at what's driving flow for the quarter, it's mostly driven by increases in accounts payable from last year. But what didn't happen, with that increasing accounts payable was an increase in inventory. We certainly had great sell through on back-to-school inventory. We had great sell through on overstock, in clearance items and inventory. And we also had some operational changes in the way that we're managing the supply chain on ink and toner that we think are going to be permanent.

And what kind of metrics are you looking at to kind of determine your market outperformance?","So, I'll let Chad comment more broadly, but specifically to some of the details, I think we do see share gains for the business. We mentioned that we have some particular strength on the east coast. I think we were also advantage of this by some of the markets that were most negatively impacted with starts being areas where we don't play a ton of big chunks California for example. But even in the markets where there has been some decay, we have still seen some sharp growth. And I think that Chad hit on a couple of the points as to why, I mean we are a reliable provider, we are a trusted partner for our home builder and customers, and we performed well. But more broadly, I would say that, that east of the Mississippi for us this year has definitely been going to strength where we've seen the biggest share gains and the biggest successes.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I'm still a, my firm believer that that is not going to go away, the labor shortage is not going to go away, the cost of labor is not going to go away.

RDUS,Q4,2017,"And then sorry one other follow-up that I just wanted to ask, can you just detail in terms of PK data that you have on slide 31, how many patients – what was the sample size that you had to generate the AUC exposure, can you have any arrow bars on here, how variable was the response and how confident do you feel in patch to patch variability.","That's actually a great and actually a very important question. So the dataset you're looking at on that slide is derived from 20 patients with our optimized patch. And so from a PK perspective, that's actually quite a rich dataset that does actually give us a very good handle on what the variability of the patch is and I think we're very encouraged to see that that patch variability is in line with what we see with subcutaneous injection and that's even a prepay experience with our prototypes as well. And also that, when we’ve conducted this exposure response analysis, putting this transdermal PK data into that model, one of the things that it looks at is also the inherent variability. So when you see the estimated mean and 95% confidence intervals for the BMD change on I think slide 32, you're actually seeing the integrated effects of variability in that model as well again, which I think gives us high degree of confidence that we have a patch that is suitable to go into the pivotal study with a great probability of success.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Can you give us an idea, you mentioned in your prepared comments, Brian, about cost structure in that business specifically. I mean is there an idea you can give us, what percentage do you expect the cost of manufacturing to go down over time and maybe the timing on that as you look out into the next two or three years?","I won’t speak, Anthony, to the decline in costing for obvious competitive reasons. But what you're looking at a market that has declined from a price standpoint rather dramatically. Pricing in the high teens to pricing today somewhere in the range just north of our plasma pricing. And our plasma pricing as we’ve said is roughly about $10 a kit. And our plasma kits, when you think about the components of a plasma kit is a more complex kit to manufacture with bowls and filtration, needles, bottles, tubing etc. etc. And so our focus there is to learn much of what we need to apply, much of what we in plasma into whole blood. We knew that opportunity existed, we've accelerated those initiatives. We feel good about being able to position ourselves to compete more aggressively on price but we're not interested in taking this market down to pricing levels that are frankly so dramatic that it destroys this market. We believe we have much more than just price. We believe that what we're doing will take significant cost out of the transfusion and that’s the focus. You have different camps that exist out there today. But the beauty of what we're doing here is really going to be tested in fiscal ‘15 into ‘16 and there's a number of tenders around the world that will start to come out in fiscal late ’16, really more into fiscal ‘17 and our focus will be on proving out that the benefit is not in the cost of the collection alone but in the cost of transfusion and the impact the collectors can have in affecting that through their hospital customers.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,1.0

I think, Tom, I think we're talking about being able to grow free cash flow and you can see our history in reacquiring our shares. I think Tom talked about around 14% of our outstanding over the last three years alone.

Our license fees were still down slightly over last year. Though also in the quarter, they were down about $4 million to $5 million. But we still had a good quarter sequentially in license revenue over the third quarter. And so good there, but term fees were up very small again in the current year from that standpoint. Regarding the StoneRiver question, to highlight what you said, is we did get a dividend and loan lower repayment of about $89 million, $90 million. We did back that out of our free cash flow, but that should not impact their equity earnings going forward.

So are they looking at the Nucleosome IQ testing as something where they are trying to get a handle on it? Or do they have an actual application in mind, for example, is the companion diagnostic?","A lot of both, but mainly where they have a purpose in mind. A lot of monitoring of efficacy of their therapies in development in cancer in the toeses. Also in the animal space, we have actually worked with a few groups looking to use our assays, obviously, in the dog space as well. But so far as so yes, we have a handful have actually only been quite recently we even started so we have been very happy with the response. We have one sales member manual who has been chasing the tree. And there is turns out looks like there is a steady demand for epigenetic profiling. So yes, it is four particular uses. So as we talked about the revenue, it can be very small, it can be very large depends on where you sit in that continuum typically starts out to be more in the sort of small tens of thousands of dollars. A big quote, over a sort of six month period, could get into seven figures. But so that is the kind of the ballpark you are looking at. But of course, if it becomes part of the 510(k) or FDA study, then you are looking at a much larger amount. But obviously, most things don’t progress to that level. But it is a very good way of getting known, very good way to get more publications, very good way to get to. So it is, yes, I would expect to see, you never know, the contracts, I suppose the discussions might go nowhere. But there is certainly a lot of interest. Some of them are quite well advanced. So I would be surprised if we didn’t close a few of them in the sort of short to medium term. And it is just a good way to get things moving. And I think it is very encouraging to see silver one is now I think there is 12 or 13 different recombinantly presents were producing. We could offer service for I think about 15 different new custom assays. So and potentially, you could capture as a service as well, which could be the revenue next year.

We still have 780,000 that is pending. We will continue to do that. And we do have a facility available for that, plus we also looking at and always have been looking at potential acquisitions, both in terms of platform, as we have spoken about and done in the past and in terms of vertical markets. And Chuck's always looked at the healthcare vertical. We anticipate for that vertical we may need to look at some sort of acquisition to get the size we need for that vertical and the expertise.

But if you could maybe just kind of provide a little bit more color on the move. And then I know in the past, the leverage target has had a little bit of flexibility, with the statement that you could be above or below that target at any one time. I guess if you could just provide how we should be thinking about the new one of 2 to 2.25, 2.75. And then I just have one follow-up as well.","Sure. I think if you -- some of the things that we talked about this morning, our business is not as capital-intensive as it used to be. And I think that's the same for all of our competitors. So I think there's one place where you're not going to see our CapEx go beyond where it is today. I mean, if asset-light is becoming more and more. We've got $1 billion that we outsource today that, quite frankly, we don't believe we get credit from investors on the equity side for what we're doing there from a sourcing standpoint that we provide to our customers within our bundled approach. So we feel pretty good as far as what our outflows are going to be as it relates to capital expenditures. I think the deals that are out there today or that could be out there today in our marketplace, from where we sit, from our position of strength, we believe they'd be delevering deals at this point. As we've provided, again, that the property that we're looking at is someone that has the characteristics that we look for, whether it's cost, capacity or customers. We think right now that those transactions that would be there would not result in, long term, going past the guardrails that we've proposed to you today. So in the past, I've told you -- we've said, hey, it could go up or it could go down. Yes, that always could be the case, but this is where -- we never want to be a group that tells you that we're doing something that we can't do. A number of you had criticized me for not saying why aren't you going to be at 2 to 2.5. And we will eventually, at some point in time in our lifetime, we'll get there. But right now, I think that the best way for us to operate this particular platform is that we gradually bring it down, and I think we've demonstrated to you again, like we've demonstrated to you other things that we've said we'd do, we follow through on that.

So maybe a soft inventory out there today, but in general, the off price channels continue to comment that inventory in the marketplace remains robust. You guys have certainly benefited from better inventory turns but better merchandise margins over time. If the brands do follow through with that strategy and take inventory lower, it becomes a bit counterintuitive for us to keep hearing off price industry in general, to say that, we still see plentiful inventory out there. How do you think forward to if inventories do get a little bit harder to come by, how you look at approaching your business for next year? Thanks.","So, those are good questions.

","And I think you hit the nail on the head a little bit in terms of the industry-wide inventory levels. I think that that disruption we saw earlier in the year with regard to transport caused people to take safer positions. So, when it turned, there was enough wood on the ground and in the channel that people have been able to do what Chad talked about, which is just kind of wait it out a little bit, see what's happened, and it's corresponded with the seasonal decline in usage.

","To some degree, I almost feel like we're victims of our own actions. I think as prices start to fall, everybody gets a little more cautious on buying. And so, all of a sudden, everybody's gone from, oh, I've got to buy to cover my position because prices are rising, to sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see where things stop falling. And so, in a sense, we all start acting in concert and it ends up – and I think that's part of the proble And I think at some point folks are going to say this thing's hit bottom and everybody is going to start buying again, and we all know what that's going to mean. It's going to mean prices are going to go up. So I think it's a lesser concern about – I mean there's seasonality involved for sure.

One is either to this move the facility entirely at the moment that they exited or do what we call manage in places where we’d manage it for 18 months, 24 months, and then transfer it.

AVNR,Q4,2013,"And through the remaining three indications, when you also combine in major depressive disorder, which of those three do you think you have the strongest level of evidence from prior studies to support a positive outcome?
","So, there is -- probably I'll start from the backwards from the smaller study and then levodopa-induced dyskinesia, there’s published data with the DM&Q combination albeit at a higher dose but that’s published about what 10 years ago or so neurology. So that’s clinical prospective, clinical data.
We also have a -- case series reported on patients with dyskinesia or chorea, which is the type of dyskinesia and about I think 12 patients came out of Baylor College of Medicine recently, I think it was published last year, senior author is Bill Ondo and he reported majority of the patients had clinically meaningful improvement.
Chorea from various etiologies including Huntington, Parkinson’s, somebody had brain injury, very natal brain injury. But that again reinforces the data and movement disorders, so that’s pretty clear cut. In the agitation, as we mentioned we looked at -- in the PBA trials, some PBA patients also have some irritability and agitation as comorbid neuropsychiatric manifestations.
And we looked in the Star trial, which is a pivotal trial and there are two patients improved in the agitation domain of the neuropsychiatric inventory, so that’s prospectively done although it’s a post-hoc analysis, this analysis -- the assessments were done prospectively as part of the control study and it did reached significant difference from placebo and that Avanir dose related drug trend.
And, again, this is in the dose range of PBA. So, obviously for depression, we don’t not have a clinical trial in depression, but there is -- perhaps the strongest evidence here is this pharmacological in there to be binding sites for dextromethorphan or modulate classic neurotransmitter pathways that are known to working depression including serotonin and norepinephrine.
And most recently with the data in glutamate and even on sigma-1 as augmentation type strategies for anti-depressant treatment, these make this candidate of DMQ, in this case where we use 786, a likely drug for development. And we have obviously consulted with the experts in the field and we hear pretty clear endorsement for the next logical step in the development of 786 in this indication. So we feel pretty confident that there is a strong scientific rationale to pursue those.

In terms of priorities, I think what my plan really is to sit with the team and find the ways we can implement the strategic plan, which I think is the right plan, at the same time, spend more time trying to find revenue-building opportunities as opposed to just cost-cutting, which has to continue. And I really plan, for the next several months, just to listen, to spend as much time as I can in the organization to get a sense from the people as to what we're doing right, and where we can make improvements.

In terms of long term, what do we see? Our goal will be to -- we're seeing very, very nice traction in terms of our ability to charge the right price for the customer, where we've elevated the brand, she's got into more prestigious products, more trade-up products. It's really allowing us to maintain that margin position. So again, as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to look at improving the products. That's, in some cases, taking costs up.

Their relationship, their agreements with positions, this was market share that we did not have access to and although, we have - we are in a tough spot and we had to take a very tough decision and during a tough time for Core. There is some market share out there that is attractive and I would like to do what it takes to be able to maintain that going forward and so that set the stage maybe for what Frank had explained our actions are.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

But it is operational and the ERP system is in place which allows us better cost controls going forward so, and they had a nice fourth-quarter. And Brett, I think on several calls prior to that you have been quite worried about dropped balls when we shift when we shifted over, closed one plant and opened another.

TGX,Q4,2010,Brett Rice - Janney Montgomery Scott,"Yes Brett thanks for that question. I think you summarized it really well. We - under the terms of our agreement, orders that were on the books at the time the termination became effective we are required to fill and will do so. However, for orders passed that point we have agreed to fill those on a prepaid basis if they are coming from Core. Although we don't intend to do that for ever, it is a very limited transition period. So you are exactly right. And then the second part you actually explained very well, you are right we have two objectives. One; is to get paid and secondly is to retain all or as much of that TheraSeed volumes as we possibly can so, we are managing the process in such a way to give us the highest probability of achieving both. And I think that's what you stated in your question. And so your understanding is exactly right.

I do want to point out that we have not given up any of our rights. And so, there is other actions obviously that we can take if and when we believe that time is appropriate, but right now we feel like the way we are managing through this process will give us the highest probability of achieving those two objectives.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
TGX,Q4,2010,Brett Rice - Janney Montgomery Scott,"Yes. I mean look we have to be careful. We don't, we can't, speculate speak on behalf of other parties right.

And - and I don't know that I can say a lot more than that but I can tell you that there are some press releases out there that will tell you about the same thing.

You have proper - I think I do agree with the way you worded or the way you explained what you understand our position to be. We're taking a bit of a risk; it is the calculated risk because our - any actions that we may initiate on our side may have an effect that winds up reducing chances of succeeding in our two objectives which is getting paid in full, right and retaining the volume. Remember besides trying to give Core an opportunity to settle that dispute, there is something else going on, which is Core is trying to finish up their financing.

And so there are a lot of moving parts and it is a very fluid situation. I can tell you that I personally speak with the executive management at Core 1 to 2 times a week sometimes more frequently. And I can also say that up to this point the management at Core in my opinion is been very transparent with us and has been very co-operative in trying to - in understanding our issues as we start our work through this with them.

TGX,Q4,2010,Brett Rice - Janney Montgomery Scott,"You are absolutely correct. Here is the wrestling match and I think - let me try to say it the same way or maybe put it little differently than Frank. These are growth companies that historically - they will grow in at double digits - let me give you an example. This does not apply to NeedleTech specifically but let's say we have got surgical products business, you buy it in at $9 million in revenue. There are flying over $20 million and they are doing this in a very short period of time.

Yes, we do expect economies of scale from these but at the same time we are layering your bureaucracy and controls on top of them because of our regulatory environment both devices and also with our need for financial control. And so we are only a couple of months into paying in the electric bill up there in a very unusual - in a very unusual nasty cold winter.

So I agree with you, how about if I say going forward Frank and I look for an opportunity to if nothing else, look for the ranges and Brett I'm sorry to confuse that one more point. The NeedleTech line primarily components, they are going to have low margins than the finished goods. And so the lumping everything into one easy range is going to be a little bit on difficult side.

So I can't answer your question specifically, I can give you the uncertainty around trying to find a specific number for you.

HAE,Q4,2014,"Brian, first I want to follow up on something you said a moment ago. You said that you expected fiscal ‘16 and ‘17 tenders that you would target in the whole blood segment, can you give quantify what the value of those tenders could be?","At this point, I can’t Ray. There is – if you go outside the United States, these tenders are typically by country. Some of them are sole sourced, many of them are dual sourced. We have a listing by country today of where those tenders are, what opportunities exist with those tenders. There is some that we’re being a little more aggressive with. From a competitive standpoint, Ray, it would be inappropriate for us to speak publicly about that at this point in time, not only for that reason but also with confidentiality of those customers. The point that we’ve made to this point is that please trust that we are not sitting idle. As we focused on the American Red business, we were aggressive there. We expected to be successful in that sense. We were not, we were being prudent in our approach to that. We are now being prudent as we go through fiscal ’15, what that means, our redirected focus to other customers around the world, the timing of those tenders, but we’ve begun working with those customers now, much more early, much more rapidly than we might have expected otherwise. And we’re going to start working with them, not only on the opportunity that exists in bringing our products in from a cost standpoint but how does blood management play in that and what are they doing to really try to address cost within their health systems. That’s about all I can say in that at this point",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
HAE,Q4,2014,"Brian, you briefly discussed obviously the whole blood outlook and all. Maybe you could -- with the U.S. market appearing to be at least a little bit on hold in terms of milestones that we may see, maybe you could talk about your plans or your strategies for the international market, which obviously is a much greater opportunity and size. I realize it is diversified and split up and fractionated, so maybe not all in one lump sum, but maybe you can discuss your outlook there, your strategy and how you can maybe get some better penetration on that side?","Yeah, Larry, as you know, part of our strategy was to win here in the U.S. We won HemeXcel, we are working with that customer and working independently to reduce the costs of those products. When we acquired the Pall transfusion medicine business we knew that it had a cost position that was a bit challenged outside the United States and we saw the impact of that, with that tender we lost at the beginning – the European tender we lost at the beginning of last fiscal year. The margin of that was single-digit. So we began an initiative this past year to really focus on doing that. The benefit of doing that with existing customer is you can move more rapidly through the form, fit, function analysis where we’ve begun that process, we fully expect that to play out in fiscal ‘15 and beyond. It's part of what we're doing in our manufacturing as well, looking at certain things that will take over responsibility for manufacturing that are components being manufactured by others today. So there is an entire process that’s involved here. We will give more visibility to that exactly at our May investor conference but that's absolutely our focus. Now these are tenders that are determined basically by country. There's not a lot of these coming up in fiscal ’15. So while we have fiscal ‘15 to really work through this process, we don't expect that we’re going to see a number of opportunities play out there but we’re beginning to work now with customers in key countries around the world, where we do expect us to be in a much better position in fiscal ‘16 and beyond to take a lower cost product and some new blood management solutions, many of those being launched this year to bring to bear on those markets.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
HAE,Q4,2014,"Brian, you continue to reiterate that you are committed to executing on your existing strategy in whole blood and blood management. That said, the investment spending in M&A that you've done over the past several years have all been directed at a market that now looks like it is materially smaller and less profitable than you thought at first. At what point do you think you need to reevaluate your strategy?","James, it won't surprise you to hear me say that we have been reevaluating that. And that's why we remain committed to it. Look, there is no question that, had we known that this market was going to see some of the declines but it was going to go through, that we may have paused before we had done the acquisition of the Pall transfusion medicine business. But there's also no question that to be a blood management company we needed to be in whole blood. It was the largest part of blood collection that we were not in around the globe, it's 97% of what our customers do in terms of blood collection. So we needed to be in that space. Timing arguably wasn't the best but it is also a part of what has enabled us to really come after the VCC initiatives, driving some very significant savings and some returns for our shareholders, much of that still yet to come. So I can appreciate the question and you can appreciate as well that that's something we have evaluated ourselves. We still believe strongly that what we're doing there, bringing automation to this very manual process, much like we did in plasma is going to pay off. It's going to be a bit more challenging and that it’s a country by country specific implementation but we remain committed to that for all the reasons why we were successful in plasma.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

We said we’re going to be down in the first quarter. We were -- we're actually on the bottom line working materially of our own internal plan.

SYK,Q2,2021,"But when you say you have a product for that ship it's not just a robot, but I would assume that you're building out a whole ASC suite, is that the right way to think about it?","Yes Joanne, the right way to think about it is, we have virtually everything they need for an orthopedic surgery center from building out the suites with the booms and the lights and the room design, to the operating table, to the beds and stretchers that are required, to the power tools and the flight helmets that they wear, all the implants from foot and ankle procedures, all the way to shoulder, including hips and knees, sports medicine procedures. Just think about our portfolio it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with one company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done.

So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also you may have read recently that we have this deal with conformance that we worked on a couple years ago. We have started launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization, we call it kind of a knee in a box. The official name of it is Triathlon AS-I with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC and that's now launched, but frankly a few years ago we didn't realize that Masko would be popular in the surgery center as proving to be. So we now have both said that we cannot, because some surgery centers won't own have a robot, but yes it involves a huge portion of our portfolio across some of our MedSurg products as well as our implant businesses.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

And what's the biggest challenge to that performance?","Well, I mean, the key, if you like, the bigger picture here and therefore, I mean, going into the future, well then, they start -- what is the starting point here? The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e. we are and will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012, on the key question there, the first one, we have built the financial crisis, triggered an economy crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times. And we have a portfolio to do that in the good and in the bad times, because it covers all price points. The second key question always is will governments make rational excise tax decisions? We believe yes, but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen. But net-net, we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trends there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the big Russian market, I see only a slight decline. In the very big Indonesian market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be -- the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes, that -- and I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick, because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is that you have always to do your homework and keep your cost under control, which is what we are doing. I have elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator. We have generated, over the first 9 months of this year, an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also, our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So -- and the last point, I mentioned it before on the question before, our global footprint always allows you to balance the bad with the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, and we have been working hard to get where we are.

What’s the best way to characterize the shortfall in terms of a return on the investment, is it a competitive problem, is a pricing problem in end markets. The answer is probably some of each but if you give a light there be helpful?","Well I’d say couple of things, one is that a lot of what we are trying to build is in fact showing improvement which is a little hard to see through some of the challenging news that we have here but the what I will call the standard digital signage product sales while they were only up 15% this quarter they were up great deal in this last quarter. And I think by the time we get to the end of the year. I don’t know exactly what that number will be, but it's going to be up at least 40% or something along those lines maybe 50%. And that’s exactly what we were trying to do. The difficult challenge is some of the places that we worked looking to grow but we were counting on holding steady or maybe having some modest growth from the markets they are in have not done as well. So, in our EL product and in some of the custom digital signage which e didn’t expect to grow and in some of the other product lines that high end home etcetera, where we were looking to kind of stay flat, we have seen declines there. We weren’t upping the investment in those areas but we were expecting those businesses to continue to provide the kind of value they were. So, we have made some good progress. Now I’d say that just in the last few months, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown to what was a rather torrid growth pace in some of the digital signage areas. And we have seen a few analyst reports saying that yes Q1 calendar was a little slower and step down from what people have been seeing at the torrid pace there. So, there is a little bit of market timing and pause issues you will but our indications and the step we see going forward is there continues to be a robust set of opportunities and customers beginning to look at deploying more in a digital signage area. So, I think it's a combination of some good progress maybe not quite as much as we had hope to in some of the areas we were investing in coupled with some declines that we had not been anticipating in the areas that we were not really investing in. So, make sure if that answers your questions as precisely as you like, but that’s a picture I’d draw.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
NAFC,Q4,2007,Can you give us some more detail on some of the investments you are making with Operation Fresh Start and when do you think you will actually start seeing the returns on those?,"Yes. We mentioned at the end of third quarter that we are primarily investing in three areas. One is our distribution and logistics by putting in more of an upstream, downstream distribution approach starting in the east and ultimately taking that to the west. The second is investing in systems that we really needed to drive our whole center store project to really drive world class category management. Third, some investments in some of our formats in order to move that needle forward by expanding our Avanza format and then remodeling some of our conventional stores into what we refer to as our everyday value format. Mark, that's a larger 45,000, 50,000 square foot store which is greatly exaggerated in its perishable offerings. And to be honest, we shrink a little the grocery offerings, but it also has a much stronger price impression than the core of the store.

Now we've indicated that in 2008, among those three categories we would invest roughly $25 million and that in addition to that we would need about our typical $25 million for maintenance CapEx. So we have committed that between the two, we would not spend more than $50 million in total toward our strategic investments unless for some reason we saw some early signs that we were wildly successful and that we needed to accelerate that for some reason.

So we are being very cautious. We are being very thoughtful. In all of those investments, Mark, we demand a 15% IRR. We are very diligent and thoughtful about that. So we choose our projects wisely. But that I hope gives you a bit of flavor of how we're approaching the investments.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
ICD,Q1,2020,Can you guys give a little more detail on how cost structure initiatives are going to affect the daily operating expenses through the rest of the year? Maybe if you guys get more rigs to work are we going to see the costs come down and stage...," Yes. So, yes, operating -- how many operating rigs does matter as far as fixed cost absorption goes. For our guidance, for the second quarter we were at 13.6 to 14. I would expect that to come down a little bit even at say, six rigs. And if that's what it was in the third quarter, we're running obviously, if we're running more than that then it's a little better if running less then it's a little worse. But yes, if we can get -- the more rigs we get back to work then clearly there's fixed cost absorption that helps us out.One of the things, we are dealing -- going to have to deal with actually they're stacking costs this quarter that are substantial as a rig comes in the stack. But then there's the ongoing lease payments we make where we stack the rig and there's some maintenance you'll do on the rig to keep the engines running and things like that. As you go forward that's going to impact our cost per day as well and create some inefficiencies in this environment.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
WBA,Q4,2019,Can you help us understand more how the revenue stream is going to flow from these various products in terms of -- and concepts that you have in specialty because of more of a clearer strategy from you in terms of what your goal is to deliver?,"Well, I think -- I'd go back to the central model, which is the predominant one at the moment in terms of the model there. You can see that our growth has been pretty reasonable this year in 20%. And that will continue as a market growth. We want to grow with Prime and grow it with that model.The other -- and of course, 340B, again, is another area where we're growing as well. So that's pretty clear.Now again, we're not the biggest, but we're a lot bigger than we were two years ago and growing faster than we were two years ago. With the Shields one, it's an early stage investment. We're a minority shareholder and we're developing the local community model and specialty. We believe that more and more patients will want to be taken care of closer to their home and closer to the community. And as drugs develop, there will be new payment models.

We will be going in and doing a value mapping – value stream mapping process to really understand the economics of how blood centers are processing blood today and what the impact of this product will mean for that. In terms of your question relative to the American Red Cross, virtually every contract in this space has the opportunity to opt out if new technology is brought and I certainly expect that their contract has that. I don't know the length of that contract but you can appreciate that as we bring new science to market, we will be bringing that to our existing customers first with an obligation to those who have committed themselves to these initiatives and then taking it beyond that.

If we broken out our business in the Middle East and other parts of the world, countries in the world where we're quite robust, and it's the big investment we've been doing in these rapidly growing economies and new developing economies, which is paying off. And of course the way those economies are just natively growing. If you look at EMC as a lot -- a younger, much younger company, despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on storage until 1991-ish. So our revenues are still -- and, of course, Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed which is 54% of revenues, but kind of in a -- most of the other quarters you'll see our -- we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S. So obviously, we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services, and we've been focusing on that percentage -- on that potential while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages. So we're very -- so part of it is focused, part of it is the, I think, just the attractiveness of our product line. Part of it is the fact that we have younger and have a lot more growth opportunity relative to our potential outside the U.S., and I think that's why Asia. In Europe, as you said, as David said, in constant currency, we grew 12% which we think is pretty good. Clearly, taking share in Europe. And I think in the U.S., without a doubt, we took share.

Memory is a little bit of a bright spot in that the share gains, we're on track for the first half of the year with what we said, 3 to 4 points of share gain. We're seeing increasing demand in memory, actually. The -- both DRAM and the Flash speeds are going up dramatically. That is causing, I think, unplanned obsolescence at some of our customers. Whereas they had hoped they could reuse some legacy equipment, the mix shift toward higher-speed DRAMs and higher-speed Flash is driving a little bit more demand. And that's playing into our products' strength and driving our share north. So last year, we finished around 25%, 26% share of the memory market.

Yeah, we have mentioned it in prior earnings releases. But this year, the severity of what we saw impacting operations from the Northwest to the East-West on almost a rolling basis for both the month of January and February shutdown operations. I mean, we saw things, for example, in the State of Minnesota where the school systems were shutdown for an entire week, consumers just weren't going out and it impacts in particular our FS business, as well as our Print business. And so, it's all driven by how active is the consumer outside their home, as well as the government shutdown, as you can imagine, a lot of paper goes into the government and people that supports the government. And so, those two factors we believe will have an impact on the business here in the first quarter.

Am I going about that math in the right way?

A portion of billable within 1 year was the $120 million you're describing. The total backlog now is -- the total unbilled backlog now is over $280 million, and the portion to be billed in the next 12 months is over $180 million. So yes, your math was right. There's $60 million more that's going to be billed in the coming 12 months than we had a year ago that was billed in the last 12 months.

With all of this momentum in mind and thinking about how the world has changed from a global pandemic standpoint, where have you gained more confidence in the long-term growth potential of this business?","I don't know if anything's really changed for us based on the pandemic. In fact, I don't think as much has changed as most people think or believe. I mean, look you just start with the fact that our business is basically 100% direct to customer platform. So we've been channel neutral our entire existence here. We don't really care where anybody places an order and whether it was through the pandemic when order shifted from stores to online or virtually with our people. As soon as our galleries reopened, our business looked pretty normal and I know there's a lot of talk about well this is going to accelerate the growth of the Internet by 10 points over the next several years. That may or may not be true. I would say we're indifferent to that. We're really indifferent with the inherent channel shift that is going to happen over the next several decades. We've anticipated that. We knew that was going to happen. We're indifferent to that happening. People are kind of reframing their models and closing stores in an accelerated rate due to the fact that there's been this channel shifts and that may be true because their model within architected with the view across - independent view across all channels strategically or financially. It might have been an old model that was architected just for a retail business and they've more recently got into a direct customer business and had a rush online without strategically thinking about all the implications of it. We built this business beginning 20 years ago as a channel-neutral business and it's a platform looking ahead at the next 20, 30, 40 years and saying, we could see the world going there. So whether it gets there - whether it goes 5% or 10% faster and there's a greater shift or slower shift, we're completely indifferent. It doesn't change anything about our real estate strategy or online strategy or anything we're doing. We believe physical - great physical - let me take great physical experiences in this physical world we live in are going to remain relevant. If anything, I think we're going to be even more relevant post this pandemic because it's - I think it scared a lot of people out of investing into the physical world. And it's just motivated a lot of people to follow the herd into rush to be an online business, rush to be a digital-first business, rush to be a digital-first business with a few stores. I know where everybody's rushing to and we don't - we only rush to some place that we figured it all out. And we thought about it a long time and very deeply, so I'd say nothing has fundamentally changed about our strategy based on the pandemic. There's - we're indifferent to the pandemic, we're solely focused on building the most compelling product assortment presented on the most inspiring immersive platform in the world with the most incredible service - services that anybody can have in this industry. And we think that those are the right things to focus on, not chasing shifts in the business. That's very kind of tactical. Others will shift to online. Great.

TGX,Q4,2010,Constantine Davides - JMP Securities,"Yes, first let me go back, the open orders were $13.6 million at the end of the year. So it is still at a pretty healthy level in our view. On the gross margins I think you calculate - you are looking at the Q4 numbers I think. Yes and so, yes I think 33% is pretty close to what the gross margin was on the surgical side, it's a little bit lower than it was about a year ago. I think you have been following us for a while and you have heard us talk about some of the factors that have affected margins especially in 2010, the changes in customer behavior some of the costs that we had to incur to address, some of that lumpiness and some of those changes the large of needle facility that came online in Q3 that increased some of our cost base. And so I think if I am not mistaken you are probably familiar with what sort of - what happened in 2010, is that correct? Look going forward, I think Chris mentioned in her comments in a few minutes ago that improving profitability in the surgical portion - in the surgical segment of our business is a very high priority for us. We have spent a couple of years investing in infrastructure, investing in capacity and we have spent a lot of money in 2010 especially on the needle facility. So we certainly have those expectations and we are certainly focused on that.

I can't forecast for you as to what the margins might be or what we are budgeting, we don't do that kind of forward-looking forecasting. But I can tell you is the picture is a little muddier when you look for - when you are looking forward not only because of what we can control that we feel pretty good we'll get right and fixed going forward, but some of the things we can't control. healthcare reform for example; there is still a lot of rule making to be made and it has got a lot of laws to be written and in fact healthcare reforms is being challenged right up in Washington right now.

So there is lot to be written in terms of Healthcare reform. I can tell you that as the results we believe of healthcare reform are health insurance premiums in our businesses - across our businesses have increased just significantly over last year not unlike a lot of other businesses. It is a big number and that obviously has an impact not only on overall profitability but on gross margins as well.

Lot of questions about med device tax and nobody is exactly sure how that - if it is going to be implemented how it is going to be implemented many, many of our products on the surgical side are components and they are not finished goods. And so perhaps we are shielded a bit from that or we have yet to see what are the final rules are and in - so forth so I'm sorry to give you such a long-winded answer but it is not sort of - it is not a straight line I guess it is what I am saying.

We the message I think is we're not satisfied with the level of profitability in that segment. We have spent time investing in the infrastructure and getting ready to be able to support continued growth and now we want to focus on the profitability going forward.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So it is not going to be a lengthy period of time at all nor was it is in the past.

As far as the channel, that's a little difficult to predict. Our objective is to retain the volume and we - as you know we have multiple channels direct as well as several distributors and each TheraSeed user is a unique case in terms of how that customer may be accessing the product for example; is it through a purchasing organization and if it is through a GPO purchasing organization perhaps there are only one or two of our channels that we can supply through.

And then my last question then, and this sort of came up earlier, but if we had a no-inflation scenario that's not impacting your revenues, what kind of organic growth, real growth, does it take to leverage SG&A even just a little bit?","Well, I think our guide historically has been that we think that there's about a 70% variable component of SG&A. I think that's fairly true. I think that – we're still very confident in the market. We think there's still a lot of opportunity there for us to grow. So we definitely don't see the existing market or the market we're looking at day-in day-out is a cause for concern, a cause for aggressive action to make sure we're getting in front of it. I realize that folks on the Street look at a decline of growth from 9% to mid-single digits as something well-nigh the apocalypse, but it still feels like a pretty healthy market for us. We're still feeling pretty good about our opportunities. So I think that we will continue to deliver along the lines of what we've been talking about over the past few quarters in terms of incrementals on working capital, commodities, SG&A. I think all those things are still holding true.

I don't see the leverage of SG&A as really a step function. I see it more as linear, and every little bit of incremental volume we get helps. And as you know, it also helps the gross margin side of things as well with volume going through our plants. And historically speaking, the busier the builders are getting, the more they're building, the less focused they are on saving a nickel here and there and become much more focused on service.

PLNR,Q2,2012,"Couple of quick things it seems like that when I read the results and kind of see what you guys are highlighting as what’s going on. It seems to me that it's pretty clear that the one growth area of the digital signage I think we are all aware that. Is everything else around digital signage, kind of just trying to maintain and create revenue and some decent margin, but do you guys see any kind of growth other places as I said to the signage that you are relatively excited about. And second part of my question and then I will slip in, is as far as the home theatre goes, any traction there and I know it seems like there is not, but I was just wondering where the home theatre business is right now an what where we see that going forward?","Okay. So, clearly digital signage does offer a lot of growth opportunities in several of the other product line we are in more of maintain our position. Although we have in this year seen some pretty nice growth in the desktop monitor and touch monitor side of our business. And we see a few opportunities there as touch interactivity becomes a bigger part of the user interface and the potential that has new operating systems from Microsoft come out that there may be more opportunities there. So, there is some potential for opportunity there but most of our views on growth or in digital signage and kind of keep most of the rest of the portfolio either in the flattish or modest growth has been our goal. As it relates to the home theatre business continues to be a very challenging market space, and we see revenues lower than what we saw a year ago, they seem to have kind of flattened over the recent pass just what we are seeing now. And we see customer still buying products but nowhere near at the rate that they were a year ago. And I think we have seen in general a bit of a step down in price on average whereas a year or two or three ago people might have been spending a little bit more per projector or per home theatre construction project that’s spending a little bit less going for maybe some lower cost products to outfit their solutions. So, we don’t see that improving a whole lot n so we are doing what we can to make sure that we are as much in control of what we need to do from expense standpoint given that revenue level.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

DELL,Q3,2011,"David, can you just remind us the bomb cost improvements in VNX versus CX4? How that helps you in your pricing strategy with VNX in the midrange and sort of what that leverage allows you to do in the market?","Yes, Alex, what we said when we introduced VNX and VNXe, and it's actually holding out pretty well, is that with VNX, we expect to get slightly higher average gross margins than the predecessor products. And with VNXe, we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins in the prior products, so that is -- because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. But in total, the gross margins are pretty comparable in terms of the new family to the old family, and that's pretty much how it's being playing out. That's the strategy we talked about in January. And as you've gone through the year, that's what we've seen happening. Obviously, we've got a much more opportunity to sell software and upsell software packages on the VNX. We basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into 3 or 4 bundles on the VNX, and that's also being successful. So we're getting higher software attached rates which is also helping gross margins. So we think we're very well positioned competitively on VNX and also VNXe, and the margin profile is as we expected. A couple of other things I'd point out as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models that kind of high end and mid-tier, we're getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tier storage agenda which is, again, is relatively unique in the market place and is also helping with margins. So the strategy as we played it out in terms of bringing the tiering, bringing the differentiation and having the price point differences is working for us in the margins and holding it well.

Year-on-year, the big driver is our product margins. Basically, VMware product margins improved and storage product margin improved, and the storage product margins are from 2 things. One is from a continued mix shift towards our higher margin products, which is our software products and our appliances, and we've kind of promoted that theme for the last kind of couple of years. That helps us. But we also got some margin rate improvements in almost all the major products on a year-on-year basis as well. Quarter-on-quarter, we saw a little bit of improvements in product gross margins, but the bigger improvement quarter-on-quarter was in services gross margin where a couple of things happened. We saw a mixed shift towards our maintenance services which are more profitable than our professional services.

We started comping up pretty good in May and June. We kind of in the fall season, we peaked I think August, September, Jack, 45, 47 or something like that in the core business. Okay, yes. So we kind of peaked in there and then we had a bit of a slowdown in the Q4 period and some of that in Q4 we had more kind of clearance merchandise that we were moving through last year. So that that probably brought our growth rates down a bit year-over-year. We just had more stuff. We were transitioning some of our floors and other things. So we had some things that we were moving through that gave us a little extra revenue. But yes, I think that the real question Michael is this kind of accelerated lift that started the last two weeks of January, right? The last two weeks of January, we started to see an acceleration up into the 50s and 60s. And then it went into the 70s in February and a then the first two weeks of March into the 90s. And that's kind of unexplainable, right? But this is how we think about it. We think about it more, for instance, percentage lift, we look at the dollar trend of the business. So we got a dollar trend of the business and the dollar trend of the business unless there’s a real economic move here like if nothing happens, my sense is the dollar trend of the business could soften in the second half but I don’t think it’s going to collapse, right? And I think that that’s probably other people in the home business are looking at that and saying like, yes, the dollar the trend might swing 10, 15 points maybe up to 20. So, I sit here and if I - we roll this dollar trend out, we think it's the year could be unbelievable, right? But we think there's going to be some kind of slowdown. It's not so much the comp slowdown, it's the dollar trend. The dollar trend right now is much higher than last year's dollar trend when we were running up 40, right? Like in February, March, right? So that that means it could be a really good year for everybody in the home sector and that that might just mean some people like the headline and like stronger for longer, I don’t know if that one is yours or someone but someone's got the stronger for longer thing and I think that could be true. This thing could carry us through 2021 and it could go through 2022, none of us know. Like we're not building a cost structure for that, we’re going to stay inside our company like cost chase sales, don't ever have sales chase costs you'll always be behind. And I think the other positive people are going to get out of this is for the most part, I don't think too many companies are building the cost structure based on the trend. So everybody's going to get kind of more leverage during this period time. So but we're all trying to figure it out. I mean, we're all trying to figure it out and just - for us, it’s just understanding where is our fundamental business with or without a pandemic, so we can think long term and invest long term and kind of be ambivalent about the pandemic kind of, like, we’re ambivalent between online or store or whatnot.

I have frequent discussions internally, talk to the board about it quarterly. We have paid the $1 for a share dividend going back since 2003, and our guidance in taking down our leverage target, the gross target from -- down to the 2.25 to 2.75, if you run through the midpoint of our guidance, the ability to delever also coupled with the intercompany loan that we described on the last call, we, towards the end of the year, get to that range, and that even allows for a bit of M&A in there.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
RRD,Q4,2012,"Excellent. And then just one final question for you, Tom. Just when you look at the -- some of the speculation over the last few months about the dividend, can you give us any comments about that?","Yes. Look, our debt has been greatly exaggerated as a company, to steal Mark Twain's line. We've still got a capital deployment that's a disciplined approach to M&A. We're still going to consider conventional print opportunities, that where they're post-synergies, they'll be delevering due to the quick synergy payback that we can get. The target opportunities that positively impact future growth profile and continue to offer a high return, we're going to look at, and we're going to pursue divestitures. We continue to -- the other thing that Dan and his team have done, they've done a great job of continuing to managing favorable maturity profiles as the market conditions exist, and we're going to be out there taking advantage of that when the market conditions are there. We talked today about CapEx. CapEx for our business is becoming less capital-intensive. It's not like it was a number of years ago. We've said a number of times we're going to be between 2.25% and 2.5%, and we see that right now for the foreseeable future, and we don't see that changing. If it does change, it's going to be for a good reason. That means that we're getting returns as a result of that capital. If you go back to the 2012 number that we showed you today, $486 million of free cash flow, that -- you have to go back to 2003 to see a year where we did not exceed that number. So I mean -- and that's with the $140 million, $150 million pension payment in 2012. This business generates cash. How we deploy it, we look on it on an every-day basis.

TER,Q2,2014,"Excellent. That's helpful. And then I guess, as my follow-up, this is a great year for SOC test, particularly when you think about Intel bringing in-house. Curious how you think about the moving parts for 2015. And I guess within that, would love to hear your thoughts around mobility, whether there's a pause as we shrink down to 16, 14 or whether you see re-up there. And then on the analog side, it sounds like that can continue. Would love to hear your thoughts there on sensors/microcontrollers, et cetera.","Well, I think -- so to start with analog, sensors and microcontrollers, I think there's a long-term systemic growth coming there that's both new applications driving an increase in unit volume growth for the devices. On top of that, there'll be increased test intensity because of some of the trends I cited in my remarks. So those 2 pieces I'm very optimistic about going into next year and beyond. Mobility is always volatile, and lots of things happen. Node -- you mentioned one, for example. Next year, there's likely to be a significant node shift. Now that in and of itself doesn't drive a lot of incremental test capacity, unless there's a yield issue, which did happen at the 28-nanometer node in 2012. So there's always this possibility that a node issue can create a temporary capacity surge. But it all averages out over time because once the yield issues are fixed, that capacity gets absorbed. That's what we saw in 2013. So as I look at where we are now and next year, I think looking at the balloons and anchors, it feels it's going to be about a similar kind of pattern with a systemic increase in test intensity perhaps buoying the market a little bit. So that's the color I can give you at this point.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
ODP,Q3,2010,"FBR. I guess, first question is for Kevin. The comps for the quarter being flat, obviously, relative to your history that's a good trend.

I guess, once you kind of moved away from that back-to-school period? And if you could give us a sense kind of how the trending maybe now, and do you get back to flat for the fourth quarter? Do they need to accelerate from the trend we're looking at here today?","We talked in August about the comp trends in North American Retail, and we said they were slightly positive at that time. As we continued to progress through the quarter, there really wasn't a material change in the comp trend. They were, if it's possible to say, less positive, and so we didn't have enough of the positive inertia to allow us to round to a positive comp. But there was not a significant drop off in the comp trends, it's just, there wasn't enough tailwind behind us to allow us to round up to a positive one. So I think that's probably the best way to characterize it.",1.0,1.0,1,0.0,1.0,2.0

Even declining stock prices on the equity markets don't really change consumption. Steep increases in unemployment will change consumption. Spain was an example of that last year. My own forecast will be that I wouldn't see Europe collapse. It's just a bit too much focus on the European problems at this point in time.

UIS,Q1,2019,"Fair enough. That's good color, Peter. And then just so Stealth, is there any update there in terms of reaching out that product into perhaps larger distribution? It doesn't really seem to be that competitive with firewall, it's kind of complementary and just wondering if there's any updates that you can potentially provide us there.","Absolutely, Joe. And in fact, I alluded to a few of those in my remarks. Historically, as we think about Stealth, we've thought of it kind of with two legs of the stool. And what you're seeing now is us very assertively adding the third leg. And I'll explain why we're doing it now as well. So the first leg has really been Stealth as a standalone offering either from a license standpoint or built into services as a SaaS offering. We have Stealth in kind of a core as well as self-identity. The second leg of the stool is really the way that adding Stealth differentiates our overall offerings. So we have been able to sign much larger deals part of the momentum you're seeing in our TCV and ACV sales is that, in addition to an ordinary course world, we're putting Stealth into those bigger deals and it is being a very, very positive differentiator for us. So that's the second leg of the stool. The third leg of the stool is really starting, I want to say last quarter of 2018 on the promise of Stealth 4.0. So Stealth 4.0, which was launched only in the first quarter actually provides Stealth in much closer to a plug and play environment. It now plays very well with third parties. So you saw me actually referred to three efforts, more than efforts, I mean, wins, for us to expand what I call the distribution [pipe of Stealth] [ph]. So we now actively have Stealth engaged in the LogRhythm environment, in the Palo Alto Networks environment. And as of yesterday, in the Dell EMC environment. So these are big deals for us. And we think over time, this will really expand that distribution pipe for Stealth. So the question might be why now? And it really is because with Stealth 4.0, we've achieved that close to plug-and-play environment we never had before. It's come an incredible way over the last several years. And in addition to that plug-and-play aspect or the easier to configure aspect, we've added something called dynamic isolation, which is almost taking the idea of Stealth and turning it on its head. When the product was imagined, it was really imagined as a very defensive product so that we would compartmentalized data, we would compartmentalized assets. We'd really prevent people from getting to assets and really protect crown jewels. So in addition to relying on firewalls, if somebody got through your firewall or if they were already inside your firewall. They could still have access only to bits of data and not all the data that would be of importance to them. That's been the premise of Stealth really since day one. What we've done now is, say, well that's an interesting premise. But most important to companies is how do they kick people out? How do they stop people from doing damage and/or rummaging around the network? So the idea behind dynamic isolation is to take this community of interest idea, which is always been part of Stealth, which is to limit the access to the specific communities that need access to the data to as soon as we identify a bad actor that identification is done through LogRhythm. It's done through Palo Alto. That's what those folks do. But as soon as they identify a bad actor or now through Dell EMC. We can use Stealth to basically close the door on them and create a community of one. So they themselves get isolated inside their own little world. So we collapse the world on them. And the promise of this. What makes this so exciting to all these third parties and why people are jumping at this and distribution pipe is increasing is because this allows the non-affected part of a network to continue to remain operational. So the idea would be rather than have an incident where you don't have to throw away every bit of hardware you have, you can really isolate the damage as soon as you identify the bad either device or the bad identity of the player, you use dynamic isolation to collapse it. That's really a change in the way we've thought about Stealth, and it too becomes effective with the new version 4.0.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
DTLK,Q2,2008,"Final question for me, it was also brought up clearly that virtualization continues to be a positive theme that you’re seeing in your customer base. What have you seen there as there’s been an argument in the industry that maybe VM Ware is catching a little bit of a slowdown just as the higher end applications or really the low hanging fruit now if you will, to start to deploy and utilize virtualization. Do you agree with that? Do you think that we’re getting to a point where virtualization has gotten to a relatively much more mature level in your customer base?","I think what we’re seeing is as customers grow virtualization up in to these more critical applications and in to the larger production environments it is becoming maybe modestly more complex for them to deploy virtualization and its becoming much more dependent on having the right storage infrastructure in place to drive that. So, we see that as a very large opportunity for us going forward so it may be a challenge for the virtualization license revenue in terms of continuing to grow all they have in the past but we see that as a significant storage opportunity going forward.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0

We absolutely do not plan for the full year for International or for Convenience and Foodservice we are growing midteens in profit. So there are some puts and takes in the first quarter that some came toward us and some went against us. The overriding one that, we are going to be working on and watching as the year unfolds is the U.S. thorough topline volume growth, because we do expect that to go from a negative in the first quarter to a positive, while we are working through the merchandising effectiveness.

But we do think because of the factors that we talked about earlier in the call, which is that we -- the trade which was a primary issue this quarter, the trade will normalize, some of the bigger volume drags will strengthen, coupled again with the positive momentum that we have in a number of areas of the business.

FISV,Q4,2010,"First of all, I just wanted to look at the margin progression. This year, the FI margins were up about 100 basis points for the full year, and Payments were down about 40 basis points for the full year. I'm just wondering, if you can just review that again. I remember, I know on different calls you talked about that, but now we have a full year under our belt. Maybe you can just talk about that a little. And then, how do you look at the segments going forward? Would you expect both to expand in 2011?","Yes. Absolutely, Dave. That's a great question. I would say of the Payments side, as you highlighted, our margins were down. I think that is the area that we have made more investments. And as you know, most of our investments continue to run through our income statement, our P&L, because a lot of that is headcount-related. And Jeff went through some of the items, I think, in his remarks, but around ZashPay, around mobile, in our debit business, in our bill payment business, in our online channel, online banking business, which, as you know, we've had some second wins there; in our Biller solutions business, which we kind of highlighted at Investor Day. So those areas have been incremental areas of investment to really drive longer term growth. So we have invested in there in those opportunities, and we'll continue to do so going forward because we think that's very important to drive growth in 2011, '12 and beyond. And so I would say it's really a higher level of investment in there. Nothing's really changed from the margin characteristics of that business. But again, we just continue to invest more there because there are more opportunities to really grow our top line in that particular area. In the Financial segment, we just continued through our operational effectiveness initiatives, et cetera. And also the check processing business, which I know we talked about before, as that kind of electronifies, we kind of pick up on the margin end. But we also have very good scale businesses as you know, Dave, in the Financial segment in our account processing area. As we continue to sign those core clients and put them on to our platform, we really have some good scale businesses there. So we're going to continue to see good increases going forward. Our guidance next year is 50 basis points plus depending on the level of investment. But we're going to continue to see good margin expansion. As you know, we've done about 700, 650 basis points over the last four to five years, had a good year this year, and finished the year really at a record level from a margin standpoint in the quarter.

You've had a nice rebound this year, but, just sort of wondering what you’re hearing from them right now.","Well, as I said earlier, Mike, the golf market, I’ll say the worldwide golf market remains very solid, it’s not slowed down and now whether that – again, as we talked just a minute ago about the economic environment whether that changes, we’ll be watching that closely, domestically and around the world. So, I think golf remains relatively positive, and one of the things that we’ve talked with you about in the past is when we hit ‘09 golf was the most impacted, which was very unusual historically in economic downturns, and our hope is maybe we could, if things slow down a bit, golf still remains solid, but something we’re watching closely. Certainly, the landscape contractor, as I said, retail-wise, we’re ahead year-to-date over last year, so that’s a plus. There is always a little bit of a concern there. Fuel prices impact particularly that business more. Now they’re softening and so that hopefully will remain positive and will comp well versus last year and set ourselves up nice for 2012. In the residential business, it had the most variability, and again, we’re heading into the snow season, that should be a positive given what happened last year spring and summer for residential next year.

So, we think that will improve as we go forward, we also think as Bill mentioned, that we think the administrative portion of SG&A will begin to trend down.

BLDR,Q3,2018,"First question relates to just the environment. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces, particularly around the lumber but also with some of these slower builder order trends of late. So, strong fourth quarter guidance. I know it's early but I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary even directionally on what you expect from 2019. Is the magnitude of decline in lumber prices and this relatively slower growth such that it will be, I guess, difficult to grow EBITDA in 2019? Or can you talk about whether you expect growth next year?","Yeah, you're right. There are a lot of moving pieces right now and it seems like a lot of things are kind of in flux. But we do still feel like overall housing demand will grow, single-family demand will grow next year. Best guess now, maybe single family is up 4%, 5%. Time will tell, obviously. But it still feels like more of a pause, a speed bump, whatever you want to call it. So I would say sitting here today I expect single family to be up. Commodity prices. It's funny, two quarters ago we were talking about how high prices were and were we going to update our long-term forecast because what we've thrown out there would be a slam dunk at those prices. And now we're talking about are prices going to stay where they are today. I think what we can all agree is prices aren't going to stay where they are. And I think when I responded to the question two quarters ago, I said, yeah, that would be great but we all known prices won't stay where they are, commodity lumber prices, they just don't, they never do. So I would fully expect to see commodity price inflation. From where we are today, it's starting to feel like we've hit some lows. And we'll be dealing with some of the same things we've dealt with last year, transportation issues, things like that. So, yes, if commodity prices stayed where they were today all the way through next year, that'd be a pretty big headwind, but I really don't anticipate that's going to happen. And we're closing out a year that was probably the most volatile ever in commodity prices and I think we managed through it really well and we're producing a hell of a year.

Can you give us a bit of a breakout in terms of how it trended in domestic versus international markets? And second question is, you guys raised some money on the debt and you guys used it for some buybacks. And there's been some speculation about some potential expansion into Europe through acquisitions. Curious on what your thoughts there are from an acquisition standpoint.","Sure, Herman. As far as ADRs go, I'd say on balance, domestic ADRs are a bit stronger than international ADRs. I'm not sure what effect FX had on that, whether that was a positive or not. So domestic ADRs in U.S. dollars this quarter were stronger than international ADRs in U.S. dollars. And I would expect, again, we've talked about in the past, which is we think we're a bit of a leading indicator as far as ADRs go. We're not sure, we're not counting on ADR strengthening further in Q4, but we certainly don't think they're going to get weaker. If anything, they might get a little bit stronger.

You saw some of the stock buyback activity in the quarter. On M&A, I think you'll continue to see a little bit of more of the same. We'll be looking to continue to make acquisitions in the media side of the business. We'll continue to look for international, say tuck-in acquisitions on the transaction side of the business. So if there's a particular market or markets where we think we can grow better or expand more quickly, we could make an acquisition in that market as well. And also, just given the strong performance of the Egencia business and the huge opportunity that we see there, yes, we're also looking at tuck-in acquisitions for Egencia as well.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Now, we don’t have numbers yet for January, but our numbers are showing growth through the first eight weeks of the year which is different than what we experienced all of last year. I suspect DeCA is probably showing some growth as well. It’s modest growth but it is growth. We’ve done a lot of hard work in this segment. We’ve got a great leadership team in place. We’ve won some new business over the past six months, and we expect that will show up in the revenue stream.

I mean, the fourth quarter is -- traditionally has always been a quarter where more of the expense is occurring than in earlier quarters of the year. That's normal. That's nothing new. That's every year the case. I mean, we give full year guidances. And as I just said, I mean, the $0.05 of currency unfavorability, we have compensated with even further improved business outlook. And as of now, at prevailing rates, the fourth quarter would be a currency-neutral quarter. So no watchout. Nothing to worry about.

We have not seen a great change over the last six months as far as pricing goes. There hasn't been any improvements or really any detriment from that standpoint.

Beyond coal logistics, I'd say we do have an interest in certain cokemaking acquisitions, but we think these are likely to be episodic over time.

EXPE,Q3,2010,"First, on TripAdvisor. The margin there compressed a little bit for the first time in a while. Can you talk about what investments you're making and what's driving that? And then second is more of a hypothetical question around ITA. But according to Hitwise, you guys get around 25% of your traffic from the search engine, the majority of which comes from Google. So if we were to hypothetically assume that the Google ITA deal goes through and that worst case scenario, a couple of years down the road, you lose a meaningful chunk of that organic traffic, how would your marketing mix or your kind of go-to-market strategy change under those hypothetical circumstances?","And Ross, on your ITA question, it's difficult to answer a hypothetical, but a couple of notes there. First of all, the majority of, at least Expedia's, and I believe hotel.com's traffic that comes from search to our site actually come through people searching for Expedia, for example. So in typing in Expedia in Google or so on, typing in hotels.com in Google. So of the 25% for Expedia, for example, the majority of that traffic is someone who's already looking for Expedia, and that person is going to find Expedia one way or the other because they are searching for something very specific. Of the searches that aren't Expedia searches, so to speak, there are other searches that we compete for and other players compete for. That traffic tends to be significantly less profitable than the direct traffic, the TripAdvisor traffic, the email traffic, et cetera, that we get. So hypothetical, that minority of traffic might come down. But certainly, it would not affect our profits in the same way because that traffic tends to be much, much less profitable traffic. That is one of our most expensive channels, so to speak. And we do continue to make investments in loyalty channels and loyalty programs, et cetera, to keep consumers coming on a direct basis and build up loyalty and build up reasons for them to come back directly to us, which is the most efficient customer acquisition tool for us.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So on TripAdvisor, the OIBA margin was 53% for the quarter. So we think absolutely fantastic performance for the business, and the core business continues to grow and be as efficient as ever. We are continuing to make acquisitions to try and fuel growth down the road as well. So the investments are fairly wide-ranging. There are a number of international points-of-sale that we've launched this year. Those tend to operate at a loss to breakeven in the first year or so. We have the investment in SniqueAway that Dara discussed earlier. We are also continuing to invest in the vacation rental space, where we think we have a pretty good opportunity to become pretty large in that space by leveraging the TripAdvisor brand, and we recently made an acquisition in that area to expand internationally. And then China, we've talked about our efforts with TripAdvisor in China fairly significantly, and we acquired a company called Kuxun, which is an air metasearch player. And then we also have a TripAdvisor-like product in China called Daodao. So for us, when we step back and we look at the amount of investments that we're making in this very high margin business and we see it grow as rapidly as it is and still deliver 53% OIBA margin for the quarter, we're pretty pleased with the balance that we've been able to strike between printing earnings as well as making sure that we are building a business for the future.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

But just given the investments that you've been making there, can you talk about what's happening competitively within Direct?

When we look at the Direct business, the combination of, obviously, our activity on the web, catalog, direct mail, e-mail, and when I look at that space, it is a highly competitive space. When you look at page search, you look at what's happening, who the different search engines. We see competition increasing significantly, the number of companies who are actually competing with us from a page-search standpoint to acquire keywords has increased significantly. We see increased activity around catalog and obviously our focus around the web. I would say generally, we're pleased with the overall performance of our Direct business. Obviously, we're involved in the whole back-to-school process, also, highly competitive. So just to see that business kind of trending flat, it is our intention to obviously return to positive growth hopefully in the near future. So no, I was not displeased in any way with our performance.

HY,Q4,2017,"For the Nuvera business.
","In the Nuvera business, that our competitor has been operating on that basis for some time, and maybe a little bit differently than we have. So that's one point. Then you come back to the core Lift Truck business, and you know, I think we -- it's a competitive business. By and large, we have got good competitors around the world, where they have good products and good capabilities. The weaker ones are in a declining position, the stronger ones are staying strong. It's a fairly limited number of strong competitors. It remains to be seen, whether the Chinese competitors become a major factor in international markets. But at the current time, they are selling a product overseas, that is not a traditional developed country product, and it would be focused in a different way than this time, at least for the time being. We have outlined to you what our strategy is on the other portions of our investment, and particularly in GS&A and we are very prudent about, very-very careful, and we think that the -- we have about the right balance of investment and expectations. But there is no question, we have a fairly long timeframe in terms of how to build the business. And we are comfortable with taking a three to five year forward look in these kinds of things, investments in that -- in product and in sales and marketing, that we view more as an investment and of course, GAAP treats them as expenses. So that is the perspective. We will keep you posted on where we are in that, and I'd just conclude by saying that, you know, we have a higher return on capital employed, than we think anyone else in the industry. It's around 20%. That's a terrific return on the capital that we have invested in the business, and so in that sense, while our margins at operating profit level are not as high as some of our competitors. In percentage terms, they have a lot more capital, because they tend to be involved in other associated businesses, such as leasing or dealer ownership that are quite capital intensive, that we are not involved in. So our strategy gives us very good returns on capital, and we do keep our eye very clearly on the capital deployment side.

So the Cmax and the Tmax is the same -- within the target for subcutaneous injection, but it's really heavily driven by our experience with our active Phase 3 dataset. That is a very rich dataset in which we have several thousand PK data points as well as we have BMD values from a large number of patients across multiple time points. That's really been a data set that’s allowed us to construct this exposure response model to be able to look at multiple PK parameters, and I think our analysis, where we input the transdermal patch data into that model gives us a very high degree of confidence that the patch we have right now is optimized patch, has the profile that it needs to be able to achieve the BMD endpoints and to be successful in a non-inferiority BMD study.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"Gary, I was hoping you could tell us a little more about the world of RH. And is this going to be a redesign of the RH website? Is this separate? How do you think about making your Web presence better as a transactional site and the importance of that? And just any more color on the world of RH.","Yes. Yes. It's just - it's really a rebuild of the entire website and kind of digital platform of the business. So it's just starting from scratch thinking about it across all the dimensions of these kind of new aspects of our business and brand. And think about it beyond just a website. But we think about it as a - it's a portal into the world of RH, right, that can take you through to our products, our places, our services, our spaces. Right. And so it's you know all the products and categories. Right. We have RH Interiors, RH Modern, we have RH Contemporary come in. We have RH Baby on trial. We have RH teen. We've got RH Outdoor. We have RH Rugs, RH Beach House, RH Ski House, RH Colors coming in. RH Couture is coming. RH Bespoke is coming in. So when we look out and we think about just the product world of RH, how do you architect that? How do you have someone navigate through that? How do you get credit for all of that on a flat screen? Right. And then we think about our places. It's really are our galleries, our guest houses, our restaurants and our residences. Right. And so those are all our places. So thinking about how someone can navigate through those areas, how do you get a reservation in one of our restaurants? How do you connect to the guest house? How do you learn about the residences that were either selling right now or we have in development? How do you look at our galleries, and what are the aspects of the different galleries and explore galleries online and maybe in a three dimensional way? Walk through a gallery like walk through the New York gallery like there and be able to shop the New York gallery online like you're in the store. Lastly we're looking at technology on multiple levels to be able to create the right kind of experience and interaction. So that's our products, that’s our places. Our services, as we think about them today, we have interior design services. We also have our contract business, right, which is kind of a service driven business. And long-term we think we can be in the architecture services business and the landscape architecture services business as we think about services as a services platform, installation services business, all kinds of things that, we can do that. we can kind of amplify the brand. And then our spaces are kind of a unique view into kind of spaces of RH which deal with RH3, luxury yacht, RH1 and RH2, our - today sort of in a corporate planes but they’ll soon be on the website and you'll be able to charter RH1 and RH2. And no one’s really even seen our planes but we designed them with the vision of they're going to be part of the ecosystem because again, we're trying to build luxury brand and you think about the very top of the pyramid. And I say, you kind of go from buying homes and then you go up to that luxury mountain and you buy a lot of homes and then you get really, really rich and you buy a jet and then you get kind of silly rich, and you buy a yacht, right? And so those are - it's the hierarchy of kind of spending in that world. And so we’re - you're going to see RH1 and RH2 which if you ask Gulfstream, they would tell you that RH1 is the most beautiful plane we’ve ever built. And they've done things that have never been done because we challenge them and help them think through how to do things. In fact when they had a Gulfstream after a long - when we have a 12-hour meeting there till 2",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"Gary, perhaps a bit of a piggyback question on Adrienne's, perhaps just a little bit more specific just thinking about the ecosystem that you guys are - you must have rolling out. I just go two questions. How meaningful do you think that could be as a brand enhancer for RH over, say, the next three to five years? And as a standalone business, how important that - as a revenue and profit contributor or as - I guess kind of the former points more important, how should we think about that?","Yes. Well, I think it's going to be a meaningful brand enhancer. And I think if - it's funny I - if you would ask me five or seven years ago, we started work upon this, I would have told you it's going to be a meaningful brand enhancer. Now, I look back, and I go, that wasn't even any good at all. We were working five, seven years ago because we keep - tend to keep making things better. And that's the great thing about kind of only having a vision about something versus kind of start working on something, right? You really learn when you start doing. And that's when you can really start accelerating your education and connect more dots to see around more corners. I think what we're about to unveil in New York and Aspen - I don't think anybody has any idea what it is. I really - I don't. It's - I've been fortunate enough in my life that - I've been traveling since I was a relatively young man and traveling all over the world. And I've been in a design business whether it be at my former - the former company I worked at or today where we search the world for the best stuff, the best design, the best hotels, the best places, where are we going to get inspired, what are we going to see? So I've seen a lot, right. I've been to most of the Aman Resorts in the world. I've been to so many so many places both personally and professionally. And someone asked me, how long have you been working on the Guesthouse? And I told them about 30 years because that's how long you've been thinking about it. That's how long you've been traveling to really great places and asking myself questions like, why don't they have this? And why isn't anybody thought of that? And why does it have to be like this? And I think when you see what we've done with the Guesthouse, there's just things that no one has ever done in hospitality. And why they say a lot of the - most of the innovation in the world happens outside. It comes from outside of industries not inside of industries, right? Like, again I go back to Tesla. The guy never built a car ever, ever. And it's massively turned over the car industry. And now every car company in the world is racing, racing to catch up, racing to have electric cars, right? We've never opened a hotel before and we're not going to now because it's not a hotel, it's a guesthouse and it's importantly said that. And when you see our website launch in the west - on the - the website launch when we open, the first thing you're going to read on the website, it says this is not a hotel, right, because it's not. It's a completely new way to think about an experience like that. And so I think when you do work like that, one, it has a great chance of having people at the top of the mountain tip their hat because they haven't seen it. I mean think about this. Like if we want - if you go to the top of the luxury mountain and say okay, who lives there? Who has the biggest house? Bernard Arnault, right, runs the biggest luxury platform in the world. I'd say internally I joke around and say look, Bernard Arnault just bought Belmond for $3 billion, right? So like nobody thinks we're impressing Bernard Arnault. I guarantee you, when he sees this guest house. He's going to be forced to tip his hat, because nobody's seen anything like this in the world. And that is what is going to create the conversation, right? That is what's going to change the perception of the brand. A brand that started underground had to dig its way out of the grave and start climbing a mountain that's never been climbed before. You just have to do things that people can't imagine. And I think this is all about - it's all about brand building. It's all about truth and respect, right? The work is our truth and I believe our work will be respected. And our truth then will be respected, and people will listen closer. They'll pay more attention to us. And then out of that, you know, out of that and same thing with the homes that we're doing, the residences that we're doing and other things you'll hear about. I mean, let me just go back for seconds to start here. We never knew anything about restaurants, right? A few years ago, everybody will tell you, you're going to open a restaurant like, what are you going to do? Who's going to run it? It's just that we had a partner to start now we run the whole thing ourselves. We have - we're vertically integrated to hospitality organization. We have 10 restaurants today. Our restaurant volumes and how they're tracking, because we keep innovating and evolving. And the things we've done in the last 18 months - 12, 18 months, you can't even see them yet because of the pandemic. But our restaurant volumes will rival the highest volume of restaurants anywhere besides the one or two great ones. But when people - when we reopen and really reopen, when we can seat all our restaurants our volumes are going to be among the best. People used to talk forever about mall developers really wanted a cheesecake factory because they did $10 million on average on restaurant. It's very likely very soon our restaurant will be at that kind of volume and it has to do with not just the number of customers coming through but the average ticket of the customer coming through which then influences who's coming through which makes sure we have an audience that is aligned with the target consumer and who we want to impress. But we're going to be a pretty good restaurant company if you looked at the numbers and the returns and the margins on our restaurants today, they're three times better than they were three years ago. And so we're pretty good at that and I think what happens is with things that you really care about, right? We talk in our company about three lenses. We look at every decision base and we choose based on what is the emotional value of an idea, what is the strategic value of an idea or what is the financial value of idea in that order, right? Because if you just focus on the financial value but idea if nobody really believes in it, if nobody's going to die trying to bring it to life, the financial value is never going to manifest itself. But if you've got ideas that have really high emotional value that the people in the organization really give a shit they really care about it. They're going to get knocked down 10 times and get up 11. The effort and the passion and the learnings that happened just change the outcome. I've seen things that have really high financial value - really high strategic value, really high emotional value, relatively high strategic value, but moderate financial value that have turned out to be the biggest financial ideas in the company because the work turns out to be so good. And on the opposite hand, I've seen just the opposite. I've seen things with moderate emotional value, relatively high strategic value, and super high financial value. Somebody thought it's worth - the $500 million idea wind up being a $5 million idea because nobody cared enough about it. And to do great work, the effort has to be - you want extraordinary outcome, you have to put an extraordinary effort. There's no shortcuts, right? Elon Musk was asked, you run three different companies. You run Tesla and SolarCity and SpaceX. How do you do that? He said, look, it's simple. It's just physics because the average executive might be working 40, 50 hours a week. And he said I work about 150 or 160 hours a week. So I work three times - I work three times more hours than the average person so I could do three times more. And he goes, it's very simple math. If you hung out with the people in our organization, you find out that we really love what we do. You cannot stop us. We are going to figure it out or die trying because it's more than just a job to us. It's our life. And when you work on stuff like that, the outcome tends to be much greater than you could even imagine in your original vision, you meaning us, right? And so that gives me - like somebody said, hey, do you think you'll ever make money in the Guesthouses? Well, I said, yes, if it - I said, look, if I don't lose a lot of money, it's going to be a really good thing for the brand. I actually think we - now, when I look at it, I think this is going to work. I mean I - we haven't sold a room, not yet. But let me tell you something, I sure want to stay there not just because we - I built it. And - but like we have thought so deeply about it that we're going to do things that no one in hospitality has ever done and they're really good ideas. And the same thing with our residences like there, we've designed the one on Red Mountain. Like it's shocking, it's so good. And so, and it's because this is, we're passionate about it. It is - these ideas have huge emotional value. And when it has high emotional value, people, they don't put in a day's work. They put in a week's worth than a day and the outcome reflects that. So I think these will at a high-level, these will massively, massively elevate and render the brand more valuable. And I'm hopeful today that they'll also have really good financial models. I feel more clear about the homes by the way. I think I think that the homes is easier math for me because I own homes and bought homes and like, I'm the consumer and I know what we can build and what we can sell them for and how much we can make, and I think will create an extraordinary product that I think we'll make a lot of money in the home business. Whether it's single family homes, condominiums, things like that, we do luxury apartments which is a really interesting market. It's like there's no great apartments in the world. They're just not designed well you know. But think about it, if we do fully furnished luxury apartments, right and how many people need to go into a market, live somewhere for a year or two, don't want to buy a home but they got a lot of money and they want to live in a really beautiful place. I mean, we think that could be a fantastic idea. The Guesthouse thing, I don't know, like it's - we're doing things no one's ever done. Like we got no meeting rooms, we've got no weddings, no nothing, no celebrations, very private. It does a few things better than anybody else in the world but it doesn't do all the thing. So it all depends what kind of room rate can we get for this extraordinary rooms and this unbelievable sense of privacy and luxury we created we'll know soon, yes, we'll know soon but we're excited about it.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"Gary, you mentioned getting more control right in the business and I was hoping you can maybe expand on that theme, right? Where your mind is at? What other aspects of the business are you looking at, gain more control over whether it be manufacturing, whether it be the whole design process, right, I think RH In-Your-Home experience? Would love to just hear your thought process on some of the ideas around control.","Yes. So Steve, this is a good question. As we think about it strategically, right, like our models is going to throw up lot of cash here. And what are we going to do with that cash? I mean, clearly, there's - you can invest it into the business. You could buy back your stock. You can pay dividends or so on and so forth. But if you look at our model look at it over the next five years, you got to kind of get out in front of it and say, what should we do and where do we see the biggest opportunities are to create more value. And what are the biggest ones we’re discussing is this idea of controlling more of the brand and I think we’re realizing as we scale the luxury mountain. There’s so much fragmentation and I always like to say products to this quality is never been made in these quantities. And I think taking more control of the product pipeline whatever that might mean whether it's the manufacturing, whether it's the sourcing whether it's - there's so many aspects of it whether it's raw material procurement and like do we take like most of our furniture is made with four species of wood, right? I don't know. Do we take positions in certain woods to give us a competitive advantage meaning like one - like is one is just sometimes getting the raw materials. If you're as big of a platform as we are in outdoor furniture securing teak is one of the challenges and should we own outdoor furniture manufacturing, so we have access to have more control and more access to raw materials that could give us a massive competitive advantage. Other parts of the business we've done we have our own furniture upholstery Manufacturing in North Carolina, it's not very big but we've learned a lot doing it and we've got thoughts about that. But also just thinking about if you keep climbing up that luxury mountain there's less and less scale in manufacturing as you get up there. It's more what I call a workshop business, very high end. Very - I should say couture and bespoke maybe, put out of breadcrumbs like that. And how do you scale that. How do you build a platform and scale that. And - or just think about this, if you think about going global. Right. I mean, our goods tend to be bulky and heavy and good. It's not superefficient shipping furniture all around the world. It works today and you know there's certain things that are different countries are better producing than others. But, the world's going to kind of keep I think with technology, and the world's going to keep getting smaller and smaller. Competitive advantages between countries I think are going go way long term. And I think they'll be - there should a more neutralness to the world. That could be so easy to find, cheap labor here or efficiencies here sold to manufacturers. I think you're - I think the world in 10 years from now is going to look very different than the world of today. And we think about it is, what's the right way to build our platform. Should we have furniture made in America for America. Should we have furniture made in Europe for Europe. Should we have furniture made in Asia for Asia. You know is that the right model. So you build a supply chain that is country centric especially where you think your biggest parts of your business are going to be. And you have - you replicate manufacturing capabilities. And then also, you don't have a single points of failure. I mean, one of things you can learn in the pandemic or something like this, right? Like, you have all this demand and it’s like you got one person making that. Or you have tariffs happening and, like, oh, crap. We make all of this there. And now all of a sudden there’s 25% tariffs. And you kind of got - you got no move, right? You’re only move is to kind of negotiate and try to figure out any way around it. But I think about - this is the situation hit us is what does a global supply chain look like for a $25 billion brand? What should that look like? And by the way no one's built one in our industry. So I think we've got a chance to completely whiteboard it and do something that's just never been done. And we've got the capital structure to invest, right, to invest to have even more strategic separation and capability than others. And we're at the high end, right? So we have a lot of leverage in what we do, right? There's a lot of leverage selling the things we sell versus selling the things other people sell at lower end of the market So, yes, we - we're thinking about every - kind of every aspect and - whether it's the supply chain and home delivery, whether it's the manufacturing, whether it's raw material procurement, and how do you control the raw materials and have leverage there, but also just leverages have accessibility. Like, if we - we have a run on peak and we can't get to peak like, that's just - you're crippled, right? And so throughout - there's going to be opportunities. These are strategic acquisitions we make that give us capabilities and things like that. How do you think about capital allocation over the next 10 years as we try to fulfill our vision? So just the right things to think about, we’re spending a lot of time thinking about all those things right now.",0.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Meaning that if you get big enough and diversify enough?","I would have to agree in that. Yes, if we can get the company over the $2 billion mark, then you get more, think of it as flying at more altitude. It does help you deal with some of the lumpiness if you were. You do get a little smoother stream of earnings. I have to admit that. But the other characteristic is that you do have to watch with the client concentration. And so we have got to get, that's why you are hearing us right now with our growth really wanting to get things happening in technology, things growing more in financial services. And we are really encouraged with the fact that Q1 we grew 29% in technology and we do believe by the second half of the year, you are going to seeing more growth in financial services.

In this cash we have a unique opportunity to see a real robust amount of data from the program later this year and we have to make some decisions about the company at that time. So, in general would not want to get below year’s cash, if that situation happens I’m comforted by the fact that by the time we receive the data, which we are comfortable that will take place in the fourth quarter that we’ll have a significant amount of time to move the business forward in whatever directions dictated by the data.

NAFC,Q4,2007,"Going forward, do you expect that focus to be more on the distribution side?","Well Karen, I mean as we said at the end of the third quarter we are interested in anything that is a tuck-in acquisition that fits nicely and makes sense with our business regardless of what that is. We have indicated though that our emphasis we are making larger acquisitions. They're going to be more slanted toward distribution than other parts of our business. However, when you are offered an opportunity to acquire market share within a market that you're already strong that just makes all the sense in the world to do. So we don't rule out making acquisitions if it makes sense on the retail side. You may see us actually acquire some stores that we may intend to divest to a customer later if we can help grow our Food Distribution business.

So we will look at all sorts of opportunities but what you shouldn't expect to see is that we would go out as I mentioned earlier and acquire some retail chain. That's just not our focus. We have those opportunities come available but we decline them because it just doesn't fit with the strategy in which we have today. But for us to allow really good assets to be acquired by a competitor in a market in which we are in would not be doing the right thing for our shareholders when we can saturate and increase our market share in the given market in which we are already in.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0

We feel very strong about our offense and very good about our offense that we have with regard to the ASC and really being able to bring and leverage the full power of our product portfolio in that setting.

BGS,Q2,2014,"Good afternoon guys. A few questions, and I will just round them off. The first one is, you're not the first -- there has been a few lately that have been talking about the surprising lack of promotion response, and I know you ruled out Ortega and perhaps set that aside; but concerning with the threat that connects that lack of responses or some types of promotions I am assuming not working, its how you determine to [indiscernible] for that, it’s a relatively new phenomena, any sort of color around that would be helpful, because it seems to be something that's not just B&G related? And then secondly, any numbers you could put to your inefficiencies that you've had related to your rapid growth in acquisitions lately, such that we could think about, how much of this year's pain might be reversed in next year? Thank you.","Sure. We look at our inefficiencies on these acquisitions. I mean, we are really talking about distribution, and distribution means both delivery and warehousing, and we are seeing most of that inefficiency here in the first half. We are going to see some of it in the second half, but not to the level we saw in the first half. So as we look at that number that we are going against and trying to reduce going forward, it has probably incrementally cost us a little over $1 million in our warehousing, and about $2 million in our delivery costs. That's what we are trying -- I think we believe the move to warehousing will get most of that back in 2015. The distribution side is a little more challenging, because we are going up against carriers, who are pushing us harder and harder to increase rates. So that's -- one of the piece that could offset that, as we get more efficient and eat into that $2 million of over spending that we will do on an annual basis this year, we got to fight back on the rates that will eat away some of those savings we will see next year. But the warehousing should all happen. We should start really seeing the results in Houston here in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] much of those results, because that move will happen in the fourth quarter, but that should all be set for our Tennessee warehouse to be ready to go late fourth quarter, plus we will see those results as we head into the new 2015.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

Thank you.","Well as far as the first question goes, we are trying to figure out -- I think an awful lot of it, as far as promotional efficiency goes, it really is performance at the retailer level in terms of getting those displays -- additional price promotion in and of itself is not as powerful as the price promotion with display activity, and to the extent we don't succeed in doing that at retail, I think you're just not going to get the performance and the multiplier effect out of the promotional money that you want. So as everybody is trying to promote, it gets harder and harder to win those displays, because there is only a finite amount of room for that display activity. That's something I am always looking for, when we do promotions is can we get a display, and if we can't get a display and its just a promotion off of the shelf price, if its successful, all you're going to have is an empty shelf. You won't have enough product to support the promotion. So it’s a self-limiting thing in that sense. So I think that's a factor, and I think there is a great deal of competition for that display activity as people try and promote their way to higher volume.

Is that right, not in the systems business at all?","Well it actually caused in both sides of it, Mike, to the extent that we incorporate the hard disk drives and the memory into our server systems.

I guess what I can tell you is that, as we look at gross margin, we probably would plan on more orthopedic business, maybe impacting that gross margin, but that will be dependent on continued ramp in those businesses. On SG&A, we aren't fully ramped in terms of what I would call a normalized spend.

You said you'd been thrilled with the integration. Can you just talk a little bit about how you can use that as a potential leading source to drive incremental revenue, incremental customer bases. Has that introduced you to any other new customers that you didn't already know?","We can do better there. And in fact I was talking to one of our health systems VPs just this week. I feel we can do better there. It's about a year, and we've had some leadership changes there. I think we're very comfortable with the team. The focus at PharMEDium has really been on making sure that we maintain the high regulatory standards that FDA and others expect of us, and we're working very hard. And I think you'll see ABC and PharMEDium management team having the right orientation there. That's going to be very, very important to continue to lift the standards. So that's been a lot of the focus, and we've been through a lot of the integration. They have had some benefits from some new product launches. Their pricing there is definitely a different environment than the rest of the generic environment that we see. Their market share is very, very good. They work with 2,000 systems. And their biggest opportunity is really to just do more – a bigger share of wallet with their customers, but, their pricing is so differentiated than our overall health system GPO customers that we haven't really looked at integrated offerings. And probably shouldn't really, because it's not – you're sort of mixing apples and oranges.

It's about 125 hours per restaurant on that. I would probably, just thinking about how Tri Tip rolled out and the adjustments that we had to make, there is probably another 10 to 20 basis points related to Tri Tip in regards to how we roll that out and the additional hours from that.I think we're continuing to work out -- work our way through those things and we expect, going into really, I think, into Q4 and later Q3, that will reach our efficiencies around both of those changes there.

Would your expectation be in Q4 to continue to gain share within apparel? Is it conservative on apparel just generally and on retail generally or is there something that gives you pause about your own performance?","I think it’s nothing specific to us, Lorraine. I think, it’s more about the external environment and really the things that Barbara has mentioned that the broader political and economic environment looks uncertain. The Q3, the third quarter results that have been reported so far look relatively weak and that suggests that it could get pretty promotional as retailers try to either hold on to or avoid losing share. So the combination of those two things makes us relatively concerned about the external environment.

As through the facility utilization, I mean Asia facility for sure is a big incremental to us and last quarter we have a 65% growth compared with one year ago, so that dramatically improved our utilization.

What drove this deceleration and what plans do you have to reaccelerate online sales? And then along those lines, what have you been seeing for digital growth in the back half of the year?","Okay, this is Mary. I’ll take the first part of your question about our digital business, so your observation is correct. We were slightly down on that business this quarter and I would say the biggest impact is somewhat self-inflicted. We’re still suffering the ramifications of decisions that were made earlier where we were focused on profitability at the expense of sales. So for the online business, we did things like eliminate some of the SKUs online because of their level of profitability. We put a minimum order quantity on some of the online sales. We increased our free shipping threshold.So collectively, all of those things have put pressure on that business. What we’re trying to do about that is we’re reversing many of those decisions. Again, our top priority now is to focus on sales, and to manage the cost line through all the other initiatives that we’ve talked about, and so we are reinvesting in our online, we’re investing in improvements in our search and recommendation capabilities on the website.

Two quick ones; one just drilling down on the guidance reduction for the remainder of the year, thanks for all the color around the distribution challenges. I am just hoping you can maybe buck it for us, what percentage of that reduction, about $5 million reduction in second half guidance would you say is distribution related versus some of the other factors you called out? Thanks.","Well I think as we look at where our guidance was and what I just said before is, distribution related, which is warehouse and delivery is about $3 million of that $5 million change. And as we looked at reducing guidance, we really just looked at our shortfall here in the first half of the year, especially the second quarter, and just so, we couldn't make that up in the second half of the year. Yeah, we will be very close to the numbers that were out there in the second half, it's just that we are not going to make up the shortfall we have seen through the first half of the year. The majority of this shortfall is our distribution and the other piece of the shortfall is our shortfall on sales of the Rickland Orchards brand. We did a little over $15 million on that brand in the first half of the year. We expected that to be substantially higher than that, and that has affected our EBITDA.

I think you have to come up with concepts that make people want to use those kind of products, and that's why we like our Fiesta Flats for instance. It’s a great convenient way to make tacos, and I would argue, teenager friendly, and that you can put heck of a lot more food on that flat than you can in a regular taco shell. The Taco Kits for Two is designed to address a smaller taco meal for just a few people, rather than the family size. There is nothing like that out there, and one of the things we hear from consumers is, its great -- your taco products are great and everything, but we always have leftover, and now I got to package them somehow and all of that. That particular kit is aimed at that express consumer need. So I think you have to try hard to understand what consumers are trying to do with their lives and their eating habits and the amount of time they have and all those factors like that and design products to address those issues for them.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
ANET,Q1,2020,"Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could step back a little bit and tell us your thoughts, bigger picture about broader hyperscale investment. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm just I'm just interested how you think about these customers longer term.The framing for that near term, we're seeing these kind of material demand drivers, migration to Saas, adoption of cloud need for Elastic capacity addition and in the interim, not seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves.So I'm seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves. So I'm interested how you think about it longer term, what are the material drivers that kind of accelerate growth rates? Any specific factors that you think could be meaningful for an acceleration in the broader investment? Thank you.","Thank you, Ben. Well, look, I think the greatest acceleration for Arista came when the cloud titans made a huge migration to a lease fine architecture and especially standardized on Arista's EOS for 100 gigabit universal spine.So - and then on top of that acceleration, a number of titans co-developed with us, our join development focus that allow them to scale those through distributed datacenters all over the region and all over the cloud.So I think the next acceleration comes from more used cases, with 400-gig and 100-gig with the possibility of extending the data centers and their server density and their storage capabilities.And I don't think that’s necessarily this year but it could be in the next three years. So we will have to be a repeat or how we succeeded in 100-gig and 400-gig levels. Anshul, do you want to add something more to that?",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
AVNR,Q4,2013,"Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the pain data, I feel like I’m hearing a little bit of mixed message. You used the word disappointing but I think the prior comments for the study was really designed to inform dosing for future studies and not necessarily expecting statistical significance for the study but again looking at correlation of blood levels and efficacy. And I’m wondering how you feel about that piece of it?
And it certainly sounds like there is the potential for future development here with pain. So I’m trying to reconcile some of those issues a little bit. And then secondarily, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross to net a jump in the fourth quarter and it looks a little bit higher for the full year ahead than it was in the prior year? Thanks very much.","Hi. Mario, this is -- its Rohan. So breaking your question into two parts, the increase in the gross to net on this quarter, it was primarily driven because our Medicare part D expense specially the coverage gap which is known as the donut hole that increased significantly. Now in some ways, we were expecting this because as we continue to grow our Medicare business, the donut hole coverage with Pharma companies have to be able to continue to grow.
The reason you saw fluctuation quarter-to-quarter is we get billed once a quarter by CMS on a lagging period. And so it comes then in this time period because people tend to hit the donut hole in the third quarter and then typically by fourth quarter they go in to catastrophic coverage and then they start the year again, they are out of the donut hole.
So what you’ll start to see is we see quarterly variations between one quarter to the next. And then addressing the question about the growth in gross to net for fiscal ‘14, one thing I’d like to remind you is a significant part of our gross to net is really driven by wholesaler fees and mandatory rebates which we have to pay. In fact, it’s over 50%.
But the other reason you are seeing a slight increase versus our previous guidance is because of the new contracts we are signing with peers, which really helps access the increased amount of donut hole coverage which we expect as our Medicare business grows and the -- and the last one is the impact of the recent price increase we took. So that’s the reason it went up slightly for next year.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So we’d miss the primary efficacy end point which indeed was looking at the dose response as you mentioned. So that’s disappointing. The issue here is as we look to the overall development program is how to fit in the MS pain data which is smaller data set and on is specific type of pain, which is central neuropathic pain into the broader neuropathic pain development which focuses are primarily on peripheral neuropathic pain specifically in treatment resistant DPN pain.
So that’s the -- that sort of the work cut out for us to look at the data in this totality as we entertain the next steps in the pain development program. We will look at the -- but the data from this study and the positive data, unequivocally positive data in the DPN Phase III trial which was well powered to technical difference and we will consult both internally and also with our key pain experts who have advised the company over the years.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021,"Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on POS. Q1 was pretty strong across the board, helped somewhat by Easter. But do you have any color on what POS is doing into April, now that we're comping very -- sort of tough comparisons from COVID boost last year? And then I have a quick follow-up."," Sure. Well, what we've seen is continued strength. Obviously, if you look at the games business, and I described this a bit in the remarks, our games business up until week 12 was up 30%. And that obviously, we hit where COVID really accelerated a year ago, and so games finished the quarter at minus 5% in POS.
However, underlying POS during this period is still up 30% versus just 2019 pre-COVID level. So we're still seeing that robust gaming demand. Secondly, our toy business POS has been incredibly strong through this period and double digits up for -- post Q1. The other thing that's really important to note is that this is a period of time where we can actually supply product whereas here a year ago, the POS was being generated from inventories retailers had on hand as our games factories in Massachusetts and Ireland had been closed for eight weeks.
So we now were able to supply demand. We weren't able to supply a year ago. And similarly, supply chain disruptions had caused us to be unable to supply product during Q2 last year. And so despite good strong POS, it was really coming from inventories on hand more than our ability to replenish.
So we're seeing Q2 shape up quite well from a demand perspective. And also early on, I'll comment from our shipments perspective. We are really seeing continued strength around the product categories. Growth in our franchise brands has really been robust around the world.
In North America, Franchise Brands in Q1 grew 37%. We're really seeing our Partner Brands grow, our e-com POS was really up 34% in the first quarter with even higher numbers for several brands. Disney Princess was incredibly strong with POS up more than 60% in the first quarter, and that's continuing as the team has launched a whole array of new innovative products. So again, it's going to be a little bit of a strange comparison on POS in Q2 as compared to a year ago but the ability to supply product against real demand is very evident, and we're executing on that.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
UNVR,Q1,2017,"Good morning and thanks for taking two questions. The first one is on the U.S. volumes that you actually intend to keep, so not what you are trying to de-market, but the volumes that you actually like. Could you talk about what you are seeing there in terms of demands? You seem to talk about softness, so I am just wondering where you're seeing the softness. And the second question is on guidance sequence. I guess you are going to face tougher comps in Canada and in Europe in the second half. And that's exactly when you are trying -- when you are intending to accelerate. Can you talk about whether this will -- this should come from I guess acceleration in Canada and in Europe? Or, is it just the U.S. business seeing traction from the turnaround and accelerating extremely fast between the first half and the second half? Thank you.","So I think the reason that we're more bullish on the second half clearly it has to do with the skill set, the new people that we're hiring. And we still have a lot of positions in the U.S. for sellers. And we are picky about who we hire. Very particularly about who we hire. So it takes little more time to attract, train, develop, and then get them in the game and have them go through the sales cycle and grab the business. So that work is ongoing. But we see time on our side to make it better, faster, stronger. And I think that's the reason for the delta and the uptick we expect later in the year. If you just kind of look at our progression all I mean the fourth quarter, we saw some turning. The first quarter, we are seeing turning in the U.S. while we've maintained the growth outside the U.S. And it's absolutely true the comps for the second half were stronger but our organization is stronger. And we had more time to implement and execute on the goals that we've established. I will just add more comment on this because I think it's very important to understand the complexity around this kind of change. We're talking about culture change here. And you can't wave wand or give everybody a shot and expect it to take hold. It takes reinforcement, it takes constant repetition, it takes leadership. It takes having the right people onboard who want to go a new way and want to succeed. And that takes time. And we are moving fast. Frankly, I think quite fast given the situation we've been in. But, we want to build the foundation properly and we want this to be sustainable. And so, you can expect that this should be a natural build. Our company - I will look at it this way, our company is getting better; getting better every day. You can't see that. We are getting every month. You can't see that. But you can see that each quarter, we are getting better. And the U.S. is so -- it's such a nucleus for our turnaround. It's such an important heavy weighted element of our overall business, that's the part that we have to get right. I mean we're pretty darn -- we are never fully satisfied. That's just not the nature of the management team here. But we are pleased with what's going on in Europe. We are pleased with what's going on in Canada. It's right here in the U.S. that we got to make the change. Those changes, you are seeing the signs. You look at the third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter, and that progression continues. That is going to raise the vote for us.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

No, no. We actually said it will be worse than the average of the last three years. And you're exactly right. The main reasons why 2020 would be worse than the last three-year average would be, there's probably I would say higher percentage of PBM renewals in 2020 than there is over the following two years.

So Drew, as far as our ongoing cash flow, the transaction-related fees are 20 million, that's a one-time item, and the 10 million of Ed Tech cash flow contribution, well, that will be out of our numbers.

WBA,Q4,2019,"Good morning guys. Just a follow-up to that question from Ricky. So as we think about where the store base is going, going forward where you're adding a lot of services Kroger, LabCorp, FedEx, how should we be thinking about the gross profit dollars per store? I get the gross margin commentary of how you guys are obviously doing a lot of things there, but how should we be thinking about the gross margin profile -- or the gross profit dollars given that it becomes more like rent revenue rather than true gross profit margins?","I think if you think about it though the first place you go to is the storage in the stores. So these stories were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out three years from now there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal.And as we go through each of the partnerships because we're getting an uplift there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry in the revenue as a result of this, quite the contrary.So what you end up with is a more efficient box where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot.So I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite over rented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company versus our competitors, we probably years ago entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit.So as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent quite material reductions in the cost of rent. And then at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And I know we've not spoken about that very much today, and that's improved materially from a profitability point of view over the last period. So I think that -- I think you should think about costs coming down from a rental point of view for sure both in terms of as we rent space but also as we take advantage of the fact that we're over-rented today and a lot of these leases are coming towards us in the years ahead.

ABC,Q4,2016,"Good morning, Steve and Tim. I wanted to get back to the competitive landscape that's been such a big part of the conversation lately. First, just to be clear, are you maintaining the same pricing structure and strategy for your independents on a like-for-like basis? And secondly, you provided some commentary in the beginning, Steve, but you guys have always prided yourselves on having solid pricing data analytic capabilities. So any insights from the analytic work that you have done to sort of help us reconcile on what the various distributors are saying? Thank you.","I would say that the consolidation, although they don't acquire them, our independents are largely characterized – almost all of our independents now belong to buying groups. I came into the Drug company in 2009 and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in specialty, the wholesalers usually owned or were very involved in at least in oncology with our buying groups, and the same is true of say, Besse Medical. So, this is a function of the market, and for the most part we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups. That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example. So, as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high-teens generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last, because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing, and how that's going to change over, say, a nine-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that, you have to be thoughtful of that, because ABC is always thinking about the long-term and what does that nine year contract look like. And just because in the last nine years contracts have invariably improved, it doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same ways. And that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies, and that's a lot how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics, and then it's an important question. So, I'll let Tim also comment. But, as the groups consolidate, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts. But to the independent practice, we would say that 2,000 are very important, very critical, and that they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or, in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well. So those are the sort of discussions that we think are important. But they're not new. They've been going on for a long time. Any comments?",0.0,1.0,0,0.0,1.0,2.0

BMY,Q1,2021,"Good morning, everybody. Two, if I may. First, the office has now come out to restructure Part D with some participation by pharma through the cost structure of roughly 10%, even from a Democratic side -- from the Republican side. I was wondering if you could just kind of ballpark for us the relative impact of pharma participation in the cost structure of Part D and how does that translates into your own revenue.
And second, I was wondering how you're gonna handle the difference in prices for Zeposia between the MS market and the IBD market because of the two different price stance and you're transcending that. So how are you thinking about handles?
","OK, thank you. Thanks very much. Let me start there, and then, I'll ask Chris to address your question on Zeposia. So let me say, obviously, there is continued dialogue about the potential benefit design changes that may be discussed by the administration.
And I think it's premature to go into any assessment of what the Part D redesign -- what elements may be discussed going forward. I think what's important is a couple of things. So first of all, as you know, we have a very diversified portfolio across multiple payer segments and multiple therapeutic areas. And so there will always be different impacts on different parts of our portfolio from any benefit redesign and very different dynamics for a product like Revlimid versus a product like Eliquis.
So that makes it difficult to give you any insights into the impact of reforms because it really is important to know the details. What I think it's more important is the fact that from our perspective, it is critical that we look at reforms and have one objective in mind, which is to improve affordability for patients in Medicare Part D. That's sort of the core of the priority that the industry has. And the proposals that we'll continue to make as we interact with the administration, we'll be focused on elements of Part D redesign that include establishing out-of-pocket caps, reducing the overall impact to patients in the catastrophic phase, smoothing expenses throughout the year.
And so as proposals progress, I think it will be easier for us to provide insights into how that impacts our portfolio. Chris?

As you know, we priced Zeposia in line with the value it provides and ensuring the broadest patient access in the MS market. And as we think about UC, it's certainly too early at this point to discuss how we are thinking about pricing in UC.
What I would say is that we're going to factor price considerations. How we think about the broader access and the importance of access in IBD generally. And we have plans in place that we'll execute as we get closer to the approval of Zeposia in UC, but it's something we've been focused on for some time.

And then on the topic of the weak volume, I know Garry asked about tighter utilization management in Behavioral Care, are you seeing anything different in your acute markets, would that be a contributor as well as the weak accounting.","Sure. Again, I think the trends, Frank, overall remain much the same and that is – and again I think A.J. was asking a similar question kind of from a different angle. But, we continue to see relatively steady volumes in our most tertiary, most severe procedures, as you would expect. Because quite frankly there sort of is no alternative inpatient treatment for those kinds of procedures. Within those kinds of procedures, we have seen a shift, as I think most of our peers have away from cardiac into orthopedics and certain other specialties over the last few years. We have seen the same decline in birth that many of our peers have seen. Again, I don’t necessarily feel like any of the trends that we have seen, other than sort of as indicated by the specific conditions in our markets are terribly different than what our peers say and experienced as well. As far as the utilization management goes, in effect I would give the same answer. I think we face the same increased pressure on rigorous review of the appropriateness of admissions as every hospital in the country and as a consequence we are feeling that same shift from inpatient to outpatient that again I think every hospital feels. But I don’t necessarily have any reason to believe that in our markets or in our hospitals we are sort of experiencing it in any sort of unique way or any differently than the average hospital in the country is experiencing it.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

When do you anticipate based on this rate of enrollment that the complete trial will be completed or a norm will be completed and then also can you just review for me when the next set of interim analysis, after the end of the analysis will occur?"," Ren, thanks for the question this is Paul. The enrollment we have looked at the beginning of the year within the six date patients per month range and actually for the first seven months of this year we’ve been at that higher ends so we actually average about 8 patients per month in the first seven months. So, we think that enrollment is good but lot of people think enrollment is kind of like an assembly line and a patient comes in on Tuesday and then another one Thursday and then another one on the next Tuesday, next Thursday and it’s actually not that way at all. So, what really happens is you will get patient coming in maybe none for a couple of weeks and then you get couple of weeks we have several each week. So, its important for us to look at the bigger picture which is a quarter or two quarters enrollment, which we see nice steady progress compared to last year. The other thing is we view it as a benchmark, the genuine tech study in pancreatic cancer, which of course, is a high quality company and we’ve been consistently this year outperforming that benchmark. So, we think taken in all the things together enrollment is doing well.
We also projected that 200 patient numbers at the end of the year and the reason for that Ren was alluded to in your question when is the next interim analysis going to be? So, it’s important for us, we felt to be sure that by the end of this year we basically had the patients enrolled that would be necessary for that second interim look and we were on track to do that. So, I think on both of those fronts we’re comfortable, having said that I know Mark and his teams are always looking at ways to improve the quality of the site and continue to focus on enrollment. So, they are doing two things now, they are working really hard to get the data ready for the analysis and to be sure that enrollment is moving forward.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Don, I am hoping you can quantify the revenues through electric power products just from your industrial utilities and traction power customers.","Give me a second. Looking at our fullyear fiscal 2008, utility market basically totaled around $172 million in total revenues, industrial market segment is around $400 million, traction power was just under $40 million, were basically electrical power products of the $611.5 million. Then the balance of process control was $27.2 million, which is again municipal market.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. Good quarter, congratulations. First question on process control segment. Sales were up $2 million in the quarter to $7.3 million that recorded a loss of $560,000 versus $42,000 profit a year ago. Can you just highlight what's responsible for the loss and how do you view that segment going forward?",The biggest impact occurred in the fourth quarter as basically our costs related to the claim we have with the City and County of San Francisco. The cost basically of that unusual item continues to impact the results of the segment.,2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
SANM,Q4,2012,Good morning. I had a question around this PCB transition you’re talking about from your Malaysia facility. Your Malaysian footprint was about 5% of your revenues; are you completely closing the Malaysian facility or is it a subset of that facility?,"Okay, just to clarify your Malaysia question, we continue to have an integrated manufacturing facility, or EMS type facility in Penang, Malaysia, and what we’re in the process of transitioning is our printed circuit board facility which is in Kuching, Malaysia.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
SANM,Q4,2012,Good morning. I had a question around this PCB transition you’re talking about from your Malaysia facility. Your Malaysian footprint was about 5% of your revenues; are you completely closing the Malaysian facility or is it a subset of that facility?,"Well, we’re going to be leaving some technology engineering group there that will be working on some research and development. So basically for all the practical purposes, we’re not going to be manufacturing printed circuit board at that factory in the future. And so really, the whole focus here, Wamsi, is to this new expansion that we created in China. It’s a really high technology product, and based on a present demand and a future demand, we believe we can provide a better solution from China and in other parts of the company. I think it’s also important that we continue to invest in this business substantially. So our capabilities today, even with transitioning Malaysia operation into China and other parts of the factories around the world, are a lot stronger. And we believe that the areas that we focus on, that this was the right solution for us going forward.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
PM,Q1,2016,"Good morning. I just have two questions for you, a bit of follow-ups from earlier questions. I want to ask first if I could, when I look at the price realization in Asia, there was a larger effect from the Korea price benefit a year ago than I thought. I guess it does suggest that there was even stronger pricing in that Asia region than what I had modeled given that it was positive in the quarter. I guess I just want to understand that the comparison factor on pricing, obviously, was one of the major drags in the Asia division. That should help show better pricing in Q2 going forward based on what we know today. Is that a reasonable assumption?","It's a very reasonable assumption. You will still have a small, relative to the first quarter, small drag from Korea, but relatively not smaller than what we had in the first quarter. But the pricing in Asia in the quarter, okay, obviously masked by the Korea, but we had a very strong pricing in Indonesia, we had a pricing in Philippines, when we had a pricing in a few other locations. So, overall, I mean, Asia should be at a much better pricing level or price realizations level, which what you just saw in the Q1.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. I wanted to followup on an earlier question with regards to some of the productivity there. In past quarters, you talked about how many people you have been hiring and the ramp up there. Number one, are you still hiring at a pretty good rate? Number two, given the hiring that you have done over the past 1218 months, is that productivity starting to kick in with those newer workers?","Looking at what we're doing today, our overall employees remain relatively flat over the last few months. The hiring today is predominantly in replacement of individuals that leave, so our aggregate is basically flat. That number is decreasing as well because of, as we talked in the past, our highest risk period with new hires is the first six months or so. Actually, the highest risk is the first probably six weeks. After about six to nine months, we do a great job of converting a new employee into a longterm employee. Clearly, we have seen productivity improvements. In a project business, it's hard to develop the same metrics you do in repetitive manufacturing. I think, across the board, we're very comfortable that stability in the work force is improving and the benefits of that are beginning to be seen in our overall operating costs.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. I was wondering on a historical perspective, do you have a sense what kind of treasure threshold price on oil that your customers are more apt to go forward with projects and what kind of threshold price on oil is when they start to pull back on orders?","We don't have anything quantified. The only thing I can allude to is there's been a lot of articles written and some of our customers have stated they never made a single investment decision based on $150-a-barrel oil. I think the only thing that I can quantify that we have read was as it related to the tar sands projects, where they were looking at $45 to $55 to $60 a barrel made that economical. Nothing else that we have tangible that relates to where people are making their investment decisions.",2.0,1.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
DOV,Q2,2008,"Good morning. I wonder if you could give us a flavor for the trends geographically, what your potential exposure is to Europe, which is weakening in many countries and how much benefit you might be getting from strength in Asia and Latin America?","Alex, that is always very company specific and market specific. But I think we have a slide in our deck that shows our growth rate year-to-date. And the majority of our growth has come in Asia; that's been electronically driven. Plus, the other companies that we have that have strong Asian presence such as Knowles and others. Europe for us was actually up from a growth rate standpoint this year over last. Again, we have some businesses performing well there. Imaje, our product ID company certainly is located in Europe. SWEP [ph] has had a very good run in its heat exchanger business in Europe and we continue to see radar continues [ph] to build. They opened a new plant in China during the quarter. So they will... that will be increasing their international presence. So across the board, pretty good global engagement here. I know a lot of people are talking about Europe pulling back. Our rate of growth in Europe has kind of held in there fairly well. In fact, DE-STA-CO, which serves the automotive market in general is down certainly in U.S. The project with Audio and VW or Volkswagen in Europe have continued to keep that business quite active.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. Just a followup on Fred's questions about the orders. Given what's going on in the world, seems like a lot of refiners and chemical companies been cutting back their CapEx. So, where are you seeing the strength in this December quarter for orders? What kind of end markets are still strong?","The orders activity we have seen thus far in the first quarter continue to be representative of historical markets. It continues to have a strong impact from the oil and gas segment, both domestically as well as internationally. That comes back to, from the beginning, we really have not seen any, what I would call noticeable change in activity in the marketplace from and order activity standpoint.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. Just a question about the backlog. As a contractual matter, what are the circumstances in which a customer can either delay or cancel a project?","Delay. Typically, if the job is already on the floor, delays are in construction delays. We work with the customer all the time in those types of delays. If the job is not on the floor and we have not started that job, delays or deferrals or cancellations would be subject to cancellation clauses.",1.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
BLDR,Q2,2019,Good morning. Just a quick follow up on multifamily comment. You're not the first to talk about maybe a working through a little bit of backlog in multifamily in the second quarter. So just curious where you see that backlog now? Will we see a bit of a payback in future quarters or do feel like it's stabilized a little bit?,"I would say for us we're seeing stabilization.

We will close the third quarter at about 3.03 times and our covenant is 3.5 times max, and as we’ve said previously, we had expected that the covenant would peak in the third quarter although interestingly, it’s not too far -- in fact, I think right on top of where it ended the second quarter and in the fourth quarter, we have about $55 million of severance cash expense that we took in the fourth quarter of last year that won't repeat.

POWL,Q4,2008,"Good morning. Nice quarter in the face of some challenges. My first question relates to your '09 guidance, assuming SG&A remains roughly similar, tax rate roughly similar, all things being equal in that regard, your guidance appears to imply fairly minimal gross margin improvement relative to the second half of '08. Even given higher volumes, what would I expect maybe lower raw material costs, and what one would hope would be efficiency improvements at Power/Vac, can you kind of reconcile that for us please?","Incrementally, we will continue to show improvements as we go forward.

As we always give in our guidance that says we are trying to get back to the best period of our peak before. We're getting pretty close to that. I don't know that we're going to see the step function changes that we have seen in the past over the quarters as it relates to operating efficiencies and productivity.

VRTV,Q4,2018,"Good morning. On the Print segment, the margin improvement that you had in the fourth quarter was some on the restructuring and some on price. Can you kind of tell us little bit more about that and for your flat margin outlook kind of impact of each on that?","So, the margin improvement in Print was a direct result of the restructuring of the business that we initiated in 2018. Judy, this was a significant effort as part of reducing selling expenses in general, because the business is in structural decline. And so, that's the key driver of the margin improvement in 2018. In terms of, I think we said flattish in 2019, we do have some benefits coming from the restructuring carryover benefits. They're not as great and we anticipate that there's going to be an offset in both volume on that margin improvement, as well as -- well it's mostly volume impact in the Print segment to keep our margins relatively flat. It would be volume and bad debt.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
TAP,Q3,2008,"Good morning. Peter, I just wanted to get back on Judy’s question relative to the Foster’s swap. If I understand the logic behind buying the instrument, it’s basically making an assumption that the Foster’s stock price is going to go up, so the question is why would Molson Coors be making that assumption? What other step is there that might be involved strategically beyond just taking a flier on the Foster’s shares?","There are two points that are really important. Why have we got this? I think that’s pretty straightforward as far as we’re concerned. The Australian market has been interesting to us. We’ve studied it for quite awhile. Foster’s is interesting. We had the opportunity to get into an economic exposure at an entry price that, to us, was very attractive. We didn’t want to put the business in a position where we had an over-exposure. We haven’t done that. What we’ve done, I think, is pretty prudent and sensible within that context. That’s the background. Yeah, I don’t want to misrepresent the Foster’s management, but I think they said that they were in a very fluid situation. We’ll continue to review our position, and whatever we do we’ll do in the best interest of our shareholders. I would caution that we could take the view that we could stay where we are, we could move forward, or we might move backward and out.

I think, it was just kind of breaking even. So the $0.04, is that really the way to look at a penny of contribution from Crenlo? Is that per quarter, is that the way to think about it?","I just want to qualify. Triton was losing money at the beginning of last year. But as we exited last year, Triton was, in fact, making money.

Alan I would be interested to get your perspective on Washington heading into the elections and with the fiscal [inaudible] coming up, the potential that congress addresses sequestration either in a lame duck or in a new congress?","Yeah. Thought you were going to ask about anything that is new. Nothing happens before the election, and lame ducks are difficult. So we don’t really have any indication except that – Vice President Cheney came out a sort of seclusion and went up on The Hill and talked about the defense. So I think they are going to have to try and address something but we don’t have any indication as to where and how we accept that. The other thing I will say is that we all are in good shape with the administration.

HSY,Q3,2020,"Good morning. Thanks very much and thanks for a great Halloween, personally and professionally. The leanest of my financial ambition has been to give out full-size candy bars, which I was again able to execute. So, thank you. Two quick ones. I noticed in the data you're pricing in North America is plus 1.9 on the takeaway, plus 3.3 is what you reported. Is that just the math or is there some shrinking or different mix within retailer margins there is my first question.
And secondly, historically, when you look at -- today's velocity is generally tomorrow's distribution and your velocity has been fantastic. This is a weird year, a lot of people's velocity is fantastic. But do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that every day place -- you look at these baking items, you look at these take-home items, like this is phenomenally better velocity forget about just the total sales that you're seeing there. Do you anticipate significant share gains, perhaps structural ones -- I'm talking share of shelf here, as retailers do resets for Holiday and going forward? Thank you.","Sure. So, two parts to your question, the first was around price and some of the discrepancy. And yes, there is a mix impact. Honestly, it might be best if Melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that, because there is some complexity associated with it. But the P&L is definitely accurate. As it relates to velocity, yeah, good velocity, I like your phrase today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution, I do think that's a very accurate.
As we look at the season, you asked about Holiday, we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution, incremental SKUs throughout the year, both in terms of every day and seasons, because we've been able to deliver and the items that we then put on shelf not only could we supply them, but then they moved. So we do feel good about that.
We'll continue to take a very disciplined approach and be very careful that we don't over skew, so we really have to look at the productivity of every SKU and as long as it's good, we will be there. But yes, we have been able to gain some distribution. And going forward, I anticipate that we will continue to be able [Phonetic] to perhaps even through the first part of next year.

TTC,Q3,2011,"Good, a couple of questions, first kind of around 2012, do you have any sense of what inventory strategies might be at the dealers and the retailers in the coming season?","When you say inventory strategies, as we have discussed, we think field inventory is in good shape, right. It's up a bit with snow but that's moving as we speak. And our focus, as we've talked many times, focus is on retail. If you take care of retail everything else takes care of itself. So, we wouldn't expect to see dealers on the Residential side or the Professional side try to drive a material change in their inventory levels. I mean, not sure they can; that was certainly an issue that we worked on as we put this working capital initiative in place through 2009, 2010. Now, it goes much farther, we won't have the inventory there to support the sales. So, no, we’re in good shape there and we wouldn’t expect to see any significant change there.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
LABL,Q3,2014,"Good, good.

VCEL,Q3,2017,"Good, so very nice quarter and again the MACI launchings to be doing particularly well. Just looking kind of down the road maybe a couple years, ultimately how big do you think this product can get and is just something where you would have to expand manufacturing at some point?","Yes, Ted, I’ll start as we talk about often in our corporate presentation and as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, we think we are probably penetrating maybe 10% of the patients that we believe could benefit from MACI annually. So we think there's just a kind of upside for this product as we continue to build the brand over the foreseeable future. In terms of manufacturing capacity as Dan alluded to, we had a much larger footprint from a clean room perspective for Carticel and we had a separate MACI suite and once we removed Carticel from the market in the middle of this year, Dan and his team have embarked on converting part of the Carticel clean room over to MACI cell. We don't have any real estate constraints that we need to expand beyond that again. We're certain to be able to do that. So for us it's more about getting the certain volume levels. We may have to add some headcount at some point down the line, but there's no real estate constraint for us in terms of projected volumes into the future.",1.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,1.0

Can you talk about – I mean, and then that's something I know you guys typically do on a routine basis, but can you talk about, as we move into 2019 and if starts are flat or a little bit softer than people expect, do you think the value-add products that you have out there and some of the things you're going to be introducing will allow you to keep growing faster than the market?
","Certainly, yeah, that's the plan. And I think, as I said earlier, I don't see all of a sudden having to go out of labor to build houses. And so I think that's going to continue to be an issue for the builders, and I think the builders are going to continue to look for ways to more efficiently build homes, build homes more quickly.

UNVR,Q1,2017,"Good. To improve relations with your suppliers, are you looking to be going to like more self-sourcing for your larger product?","Thank you, Steve. I think there's two parts to the answer. One is very different for the undifferentiated products than for the differentiated products. But I think the consistent scene that we have is really changing the conversation with our suppliers, changing to conversation really with our partners, because that's what they are. These are long-term partners who have been with us for many years. And we choose our partners very carefully, and we work hard to earn the right to stay their partner. And we partner with people who are long-term winners in their space. So, it's not necessarily about sole arrangements. For some of the differentiated products it will be sole arrangements because it's difficult to invest the time in promoting someone's molecule, only to have it undercut by someone else, or it's difficult to have the degree of transparency that we'll need with our partners when developing in a specialty space if you have a crowded territory with other distributes. For the larger products, it's much more about changing that conversation, understanding the ebbs and flows of the partners' supply, and working with them and collaborating with them. So I'd think much more about changing the conversation. This is not an adversarial conversation, Steve mentioned that earlier on. This is really a conversation between partners. Many of those partnerships predate me, and many of them will go on longer after me. And that's the way we have to view it. We have to view ourselves as good stewards of that partnership while we're in place.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

","So in terms of the folks at the organization up there, they are launching new products across a variety of categories. We are launching a lot of new products into the pro paint as well as into the home center market. The home center has been a growth driver for us over the course of last three years or four years as we have been able to capture the major home center customers here in the U.S. We are pretty well positioned now, so it will be more challenging to put up the big, huge home center growth numbers of the underlying business, isn’t there. Because we’ve got shelf space everywhere. From a strategic perspective, I like the home center business. It does a lot of good things, I think, for the organization, despite the fact that it’s got lower profitability. It certainly has taught us a lot about how to manufacture and design products to hit lower price points in the market. And we can use that knowledge as we move up through our product line. It also gives us volume and allows us to have component level quantities on some parts that can be shared across product lines that are much higher volume and more cost effective than they would be had we not had that business. And really, finally, if somebody wants to try to attack our pro-business and we see the home center business and they have the ability to sell thousands of sprayers at lower price points in that market, it’s likely only a matter of time before they expand their product range up. So there’s a variety of reasons to be there, but I don’t want anybody to think that we’ve lost our focus on the pro-business. The pro-business is our bread-and-butter. And that’s where we’re launching all sorts of new products every year and actually doing very well.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
GGG,Q1,2015,"Got it, okay. And then on that mix, I mean, when historically we’ve talked about contractor margins and I know that it’s come from the investor base and us asking hey, can you get back to previous peak margins in contractor. But seeing that you are seeing a mix shift kind of headwind on the margin side there, one -- is the focus on the home center lower margin stuff, is that a strategic focus near term? If yes, why? And I guess second, how should we be thinking about the margin potential for the segment longer term?
","So just a couple of additional points of clarification. Our pricing on the products is pretty equivalent - or it is equivalent between the home center channel and the paint channel is just that we sell more entry-level units in the home center channel. We sell similar products in the paint channel and they are priced the same. So our gross margins generally increase as the features and functionality of those units increase. So the other point I wanted to make that within the paint channel in North America we have always guided to the fact that when the construction market got healthier, we would sell more of the big units. And they are the percentage of sales in that channel, I’ll call it the largest units are increasing percentage wise at a faster rate than the middle and the lower priced units. So the mix is changing in the paint channel back to more normal. The comparable issue here is that the fact that we’ve launched more and more entry-level products and that’s changing our mix.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
SCHL,Q4,2015,"Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just moving over to the international business, do you have an expectation for growth ex-foreign currency in terms of sales? And you guys did some investment spending in fiscal '15, does that continue in '16, and how much of a drag is that on profitability?","So we do expect to grow ex-currency about 4% next year. And this year we grew ex-currency about $7.5 million on that $400 million base. So in real terms, the market currencies are -- the local markets are growing. We're seeing strong growth in Asia, and continue to see double-digit growth. And then single growth in Australia, and the U.K. Canada had some headwinds this year, so they didn't see the same level of growth.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Got it, thanks for that. And then over to Neurovascular, I know you don't want to call off this acceleration during Q2 versus Q1, but that you're doing much better than the overall market by our calculations anyway, so are there specific areas that are accelerating? I don't know if it's ischemic specifically within that category, and that you're really well positioned there. And then just is your ability to bundle this much better than elsewhere? And I guess the real question is, can this business grow upper teens, low 20s for the next couple of years?","Well, it's been growing at that kind of rate for the last few years and this year, you are seeing an acceleration of growth. And what I would attribute it to is we already have fabulous coils, stent retrievers, we're already very, very good. But we've strengthened our portfolio with the flow diverting stent with the surpass of all stent, and with the 0.074, vector catheter, aspiration catheter, so that that for us was a product gap. We didn't have an easy to deploy, empty catheter approach for float diverting stent, and we didn't have a large for aspiration catheter. So we plugged those, let's call them product gaps.

And we've had fantastic expansion around the world. And really, the Atlas stent in China, as an adjunctive stent for hemorrhagic is performing exceptionally well and this global business is really, really well run. We have an exceptional leadership team over there that have been executing very well, but I would say the acceleration; let's call it this year's acceleration versus prior years is really driven by this product cycle that really has us covering all of the bases with excellent products that are meeting the needs of our customers.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
CMN,Q1,2015,"Got it, thanks. And then on the improved gross margin, good job. I'm assuming that more consumables and mix and those kinds of things is a continued focus but you also talked about a pushback, one of the headwinds on PuriCore amortization costs of somewhere in the neighborhood of $667,000 I think you said. Can you give us a sense of what that would be in Q2 and is it zero in Q3 or going to zero in Q3?","That number is one of these acquisition accounting fair value type items that push the gross profit in the months after you close a deal, a concept that we don't necessarily agree with but it's the rule. That $667,000 number is roughly half of the total. In fact I think it might even be more than half of the total that is going to need to be amortized. It happens very, very rapidly. And so let's say we have another roughly $600,000 number yet to go, most of that will unfold in the second quarter and probably just a few dollars trickling into the third quarter and then we'll be done with it.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"Got it. And also, Charlie, if I could just quickly verify, next year's constant currency growth rate would be better than the reported growth that you're assuming based on your currency? And also, should we expect billings to grow roughly in line with revenues mix here?","Okay. Yes, on a constant currency basis, the guidance would be higher because the yen has weakened 15%, the guidance rate that I gave. So that is a fair assumption. The Latin American rates have also weakened in double-digit territory.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
AVNR,Q4,2013,Got it. And can you confirm that you did see separation if only numerical separation between the treatment benefit between the two groups?,"Again there was no difference. I mean, we can talk about numerical variations but in the end you have to have something that is either a very clear trend or a statistically significant difference and we do not see that. There was an improvement from baseline and all treatment arms and that makes the hurdle even higher because as you introduce whatever bias came into the study assessment that these patients will have chronic pain, all of them will have chronic pain, all of them had at least moderate-to-severe pain at study entry coming to your trial after 12 weeks then they show an improvement.
So something happened that they improved. The problem is whatever influence the outcome of the pain scores influenced this across the treatment arms. So that makes it harder to tease apart what is the drug effect versus whatever else is happening in the study that is generating this kind of response.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
TER,Q2,2014,"Got it. And in terms of your first half orders, they were $230 million higher than your revenues. So in regard -- just taking that into account, your September quarter guidance looks a bit light. And particularly, when I think about, like, the higher utilization rates at the foundries currently, I just want to understand, like, how much of conservatism is built into your guidance for third quarter. And could there be a significant upside to it?","Yes. I'll take that one, too. If you look at our history over time, and I think I also mentioned this, our bookings in the third quarter drop anywhere from 24% to 57%. So that's a very wide range that we have to model with. It can be a steep or a small drop. So could there be upside? Yes, there could be. But we tend to try to play it conservatively so that we earn your credibility. We weren't super cautious, but we were sort of normal cautious the way we normally set our guidance. So we feel good where we set it. And another key thing for us is, if you look at Q2 and Q3 together, taken together, it's similar to what the sell-side consensus was before this call. So I think you guys got it right. It's just some business came in a little bit earlier.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
AMSWA,Q4,2016,Got it. And just how would you kind of compare the demand right now as kind of the lower-end versus the higher-end enterprises? Are you seeing the Demand Management platform start to rebound a bit here and whereas most of that strength is on the high-end large enterprises?,"The way it's working out, and [indiscernible] this is, Demand Management, while they compete for perpetual deals and win them, it's more of a midmarket type thing. But what they are really positioned well for is SaaS in the small and medium space. They've got a great platform on Azure. It's a one-click update, multi-tenant. And so their license fees aren't as big as usual but they have and they're going to end up I think eventually having much more SaaS than perpetual. And on the high end, we can do some very big SaaS deals and we already have some nice SaaS deals, but most of the deals want to be perpetual so far with cloud services where we will maintain the system for them. So it's SaaS but it's not a multi-tenant SaaS. It's private SaaS.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

I -- I would tell you -- I would say, to add to that though, even pulling out the July 4th, I don't think we are where we were, in let's call it, P6, in June where we were seeing comps across the board in the mid-2's.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0

","No. This is all -- yes this is the part of the overall data set. Again the largest data set we have and the most powerful data set is from the DPN pain phase III trial that we published.

","There are really three changes that impacted us. One is when we look at a mix of teams that we brought on board, over half of the teams in the last four quarters have been non-commercial teams named account teams. So number of sales teams we are adding is lower in the commercial segment than traditionally has been. That is the first thing. The second one which has even more short-term impact is we have a lot of marketing programs, channel programs aimed at opportunity generation and these are fairly short-cycle opportunity generation. Typically 75 to 90 days cycles in which they convert and so we pull investments from both marketing and channel or shifted investments toward larger enterprise wins rather than commercial wins.

Do you foresee any kind of large capital expenditure in the future to kind of help you grow into new capacity that you might need? Or do you feel that with all the uncertainty in the market today that you might have to hold off on any kind of growth expenditures?","Well, based on – it’s Tom. Good morning. So coming out of 2018, and especially if you look back to the first half of the year, that's sort of the capacity in the business, which is significantly different than sales in Q4 – I'm sorry, in Q1 and Q2. So just from a capacity point of view within the company, it's healthy. In terms of capital investment where we focused presently and into this year will be in two areas. One is, where we can invest in certain aged equipment to get productivity and, let's say, automation, and then on existing processes, both in our Mold-Masters business and in machining and APPT, we're looking at automation and that really is advantageous. Since when we're – at a period when we're in a very high utilization time, we really can't even take the time to take equipment down, even doing the automation or to take aged equipment now to put automated equipment in. So we'll take advantage of some of that, which is, I would say, a modest investment, certainly not at the level of capital that we spent in prior year.

But even -- if you look at even other trials recently published, some times the difference between drug and placebo is like less than a point. This is in now zero to 10-point scale.

And then the other item we’re watching is travel expenses.

Pam, as you look at Channel Islands, I think Daniel mentioned more investments in Channel Islands, and I think we had talked maybe in the past about the R&D there sort of reaching a certain maturity level and some of those investments shifting to literally sales and marketing. Just A) some understanding what those investments are, the incremental ones? And then, B) again, not near-term but over the next 12 to 24 months, is that shift from R&D in Channel Islands and spend there, so maybe sales and marketing is still part of the plan?","Yes, on the sales side we typically -- we do those investments in lock [ph] to where we see the deals. The main investments right now are really going on around building the pipeline and building a lot of the marketing in supporting sales. As we've talked about it before, we are making some changes to the sales force in terms of their focus to net new, so those are not radical changes, they are changes that we are doing on a progressive fashion; so as we convert more and more over customer base over to the cloud, we do need to continue shifting the focus of the company to new customers as well.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Got it. So kind of a combination of mix shift to large deals and then lengthening sales cycles as pricing intensifies at least in North America with these larger enterprises. As a follow-up and thinking about next year, your guidance implies product growth of 20%, 25% here for Q4. Is that the right way to think about kind of the growth rate into next year 20%, 25%? The reason why I ask that your largest competitor EMC is potentially going private next year. They’re going to be in a position to get even more aggressive on price next year, so it just seems like the structural change around pricing could be a permanent thing at least as we think about next year. And so how are you thinking about the appropriate product growth trends that given this pricing environment we should think about for next year?","Yes. So, I'll say one thing Brent. First, we don't give guidance that’s that long-term in nature. But I want to point out there are two factors that impacted us. The first factor is that in the large enterprise segment and in the large deal segment competitive pressure has been a factor that slowed us down. Perhaps the greater impact is that in going after those larger deals and in going after those larger enterprises, we shifted investments from our commercial segment where that is the second action that we are taking to avoid that shift in investments by reinvesting in our commercial segment is what we're doing. So, as you think about our corrective actions besides sort of strengthening our competitive position in the large enterprise segment by broadening our platform, investing in commercial over the next - first two quarters of next year is really what we are doing, which I think will translate into growth again. Beyond that, I don't want to get more detailed on specific growth numbers, Brent.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021,"Got it. So the first quarter is really sort of the trough. That's the highest headwind you probably saw, and it should get better throughout the rest of the year.

MPAA,Q2,2013,"Got it. Sticking with that side of the business, you had mentioned some pricing pressure that you're seeing. Is that something that you expect to be reflected in gross margins over the near-term? Or is that something you think you can mitigate?","Well, I think we'll see we may see some pressure on gross margins. But I will tell you that we, continuously -- we have a continuous improvement program. And so while we know there's always margin pressure, we continue to work our operating metric and our operating model to be more and more efficient, take more waste out of the system. So I think near-term, there will be some pricing pressure and there is pricing pressures, which is nothing new, but continues on. Longer-term, I think it's going to be critical that there'll be -- I believe there will be some price inflation. I think it will be good for everybody. I think the consumer today is getting an excellent deal and perhaps too good of a deal. So we'll see how things unfold in the future.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,0.0,1.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you're probably guiding it implicitly, call it, 800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that do you think is consoles versus non-consoles, because it's not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that's not that far off that number, which doesn't leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business.
So, is this just conservatism, or what else are you expecting here? How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus non-consoles?
","Well, I think, as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions, when I look at the full year at 28 to 30%, you know, sort of revenue growth, expect server to be significantly above that, and then, the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely. And so, you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business, as well as, you know, in the semi-custom business, and overall, we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year. So, it is not all console-weighted, if that's what you're asking.

OSUR,Q3,2020,Got it. Thanks for that. And maybe just one on the antigen pushout. Just sort of a little more color on the reasoning behind it. I saw last week the FDA updated its antigen test template that called for more studies to be submitted in the asymptomatic population. Just wondering is it a matter of more studies that need to be done? Or was it about getting the sensitivity up to where it needs to be? Just any more color on the reasoning behind the push out?,"Well of course, when you're doing product development, there's always an iterative process involved with it. And then you add to that they need to get clinical data from the field. So that interplay between let's say change in the chemistry and changing aspects of the design of the product to get to the point where we are comfortable with it I think contribute to the new forecast for the first quarter of next year. And I think that ultimately the pushout won't matter to us commercially because I think we're very confident that once the product is on the market we'll sell as many as we can make. So it has nothing to do with the external factors of what FDA is doing and everything to do with our own standards of performance. And as I said before, we are the only company that's designing a product specifically to ultimately be a self-test whether it's an Rx self-test or an OTC self-test and designing those principles into the professional use product for which we'll seek the initial EUA. So to do all those things to create a one-step rapid antigen test is a challenge that's not been accomplished by anybody yet. So that's why we're investing the time and effort to do it right.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
BLDR,Q3,2018,"Got it. Thanks for that. And then more high level, labor constraints are definitely a – we think are going to be a challenge for the remainder of this cycle, even if you're going through a period of slower growth. Could you talk about, with your large footprint for manufactured product sales, how you expect that part of your business to evolve and develop over the remainder of this cycle?
","Well, we're obviously making a lot of investments in that part of the business, the value-add side of the business, and expanding our footprint, and we will continue to do so. I do think the long-term trend is going to be less labor, less construction on the jobsite, and more done in plants or factories. And so, as we look further down the road – and I also think that labor is going to remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. So we're constantly investing in our truss and panel capacity, for example. And anywhere we can take some of that labor off the jobsite, I think that's where we're going to create the most value for our customers and create the most stickiness with our customers, and obviously that's going to result in higher margin.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
BGS,Q2,2014,"Got it. Thanks. And maybe can you just provide some qualitative color on the battle for shelf space in the base business? I know you provided some in your text, but are these the small format stores kind of grow and gain market share, as they exist in retailers, reallocate square footage away from the center of the store, the competition for that shelf space should just continue to increase, and so are you seeing it becoming more expensive to gain distribution for your new products, and alternatively, has it become more difficult to maintain distribution for existing products that just may not be achieving the same sales velocities? Thanks.","I wouldn't say it's more expensive, I would say it varies tremendously by category in terms of what's going on in the battle for shelf space. I think as I referenced entering the Mac n Cheese category is ambitious right now, because it seems as if everybody who is selling packaged grocery products is launching a Mac n Cheese. So that's an area where you're fighting for introductory space, and I am sure if you're there already, you're fighting very hard to keep the space you have, given all the money and effort that's going against that, that particular section. Hot cereal is another section that's very-very tough in terms of products coming into the section, both new hot cereal products in some cases, but products that really have nothing to do with hot cereal being put in that section. Some of these protein drinks and things like that for some reason are coming into the hot cereal sections. So it's challenging for us and we are -- but we are doing a decent job of it, but its challenging for us to maintain the space we have. In some cases, we are not losing distribution, but we are losing a facing, as retailers are eager to put these new products in and take the money that's associated with them, whether they succeed or not remains to be seen. But then there were other categories where there is really not a lot of activity going on and it's relatively calm and there is -- our distribution is not pressured. And there are categories where -- such as seasonings, where we are actually making very nice progress by introducing new Mrs. Dash seasoning packets, dips and cooking seasonings, and the Crock-Pot line as well. So there is no simple answer. We are in a lot of different categories and every category has its own dynamic. Some are highly competitive with a lot of new products coming in and some are fairly calm.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
BGS,Q2,2014,"Got it. Thanks. And one final question for us, we talk a lot about acquisitions, you guys have been very acquisitive of late. But I am curious, would you ever envision yourself as a seller of a brand, maybe some that generates solid cash flow which may not fit as well as it did several years ago, where you want to take the company. Would this be a good time to probably see what kind of valuations you could receive for those assets? Thank you.","The problem as we have discussed in prior calls, the problem with shelling a brand for us is, you would want to sell -- the brands you would sell, like well, this isn't performing up to the standards of all the other brands, you're not going to get a high multiple for those brands. But even a very good brand, we would have to get an extremely high multiple for a not-to-be a dilutive event for our company. I mean, we are valued at north of 12 times EBITDA, and assuming we depreciated the tax basis in a brand a decent amount, and we are going to have to sell a brand for the upper teens multiple in EBITDA to breakeven. So it's very hard for us to look at selling a brand and saying this is a good idea and not dilutive to our shareholders.",2.0,2.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0

So, I guess and then my second question, thinking about – obviously there's been solid growth in the kind of selling locations and the number of sales associates that you guys have active. So, what was that number in this quarter and I guess how are you thinking about the continued growth in these metrics over the next year?
","Well, for the year, we've probably added somewhere around 75 – or added or internally promoted around 75 sales folks. That's a gross number. We obviously have turnover. I don't have the net number handy. But, look, that's a big push of ours is really to put a focus on developing our sales force, developing our general managers and developing our employees overall.

TER,Q2,2014,"Got it. That's helpful. And then the second question is on the Wireless Test. If we look at the last few years, the market size has been compressing. Obviously, competition has been increasing, and there are probably 5 guys, including you guys, in the picture. So I'm just kind of curious what's got to give for the market to improve. Do you think there are like 2 or 3 competitors too many that need to get out of the business? Or do you think it is more about innovation, innovating to get the prices back up?","I think it's about innovation for the foreseeable future. That's what LitePoint was incredibly successful in the connectivity side. LitePoint's brought innovation to cellular test, but they were late to the market, so it's a different hand they had to play. I do think, with our production-focused optimized approach, that, over time, we'll win. And that includes everything from we tend to have a lower-cost product, the COGS of it. The throughput's better. It's easier to program. So it's exactly what is needed in a low-cost Asian fast-ramp manufacturing environment. Our competitors are all very capable. But they tend to come from an R&D or a general-purpose instrument and they try to bring that into the battlefield. That's not as strong an offering as we have because we optimize on the exact problem at hand. So I do think you're going to see that, over time, we'll continue to be very strong with production-optimized testing. Some of our competitors are better at general purpose or in the R&D lab.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
OSUR,Q3,2020,"Got it. That's helpful. And then, just maybe one question on the non-COVID front. You had a nice rebound in the HIV franchise in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S. I guess, on the domestic side, are you beginning to see signs of clinics reopening and domestic test volumes increasing? And then a quick little aside there would be with the, I guess, third wave as you described it in COVID here in the U.S. Should we think of, I think, Roberto said fourth quarter you expect to be better than the second quarter. But could we see maybe some of that rebound be muted here in the fourth quarter with COVID cases ticking back up?","Yes. I would say directionally, we are seeing -- we've been seeing a pickup as I think Roberto alluded to in our U.S. based HIV business. Some of that because with the clinic closings, CDC has actually issued guidelines urging those clinics to direct there would-be patients to our self-test. And so having that as an alternative in the marketplace has served us incredibly well. And so the hedge against the third wave of COVID creating a shutdown again will benefit our OraQuick HIV in-home test domestically for that reason. But we'd rather bet on the economy and clinics staying open which benefit their professional products. So while we haven't given specific guidance by product line that's the way we view the situation. So I think there's upside for us in both scenarios.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Two more quick things; one, you made mention of zero base budgeting, and is that something that you have done before or is that a -- obviously a change in strategy, because that's a pretty -- can be a pretty serious shift, in the way a company thinks about its cost structure. Typically really good systems also have been, historically in my experience, required to be able to do ZBB in a way where it can be successful. So I am trying to get a sense there of how big a shift that is for you?","We have done it in the past occasionally, when we ran into difficulties. The decision to do with this -- at this point in time, probably reflects the fact that, we had a very good run for a good number of years and had some very excellent results and perhaps haven't challenged ourselves on the cost side as hard as we should have, and its time to put ourselves up against the wall and ask some hard questions again.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
DGII,Q3,2018,"Got you and looking at the guidance into September of 60 million to 64 million, could you give us a guide or an idea sequentially about how you see both on the hardware products side performing in terms of some of the traditional categories that you talked about in routers embedded et cetera. And then also with regard to the solution side of the equation, I think talking about 25 million to 30 million will be the target for this year, implies you are kind of flat to up sequentially. Maybe give us some frame work for how you're thinking about seeing things swing in that range for solutions as we going to September, what are going to be the driving factors there to move it either get it flat or move it up.
","Yes I think Scott, you picked up on this really nicely when you kind take that 25 to 30 brackets and you backfill based on what's been accomplished so far. You're looking at kind of flat to maybe modestly up quarter for solutions. It’s going to be driven quite frankly a lot by our ability for our customers to absorb the rollouts. We are anticipating success there but some of these larger implementations can run into some timing issues with access to facilities training and resources and et cetera.

And then kind of some of the things you are seeing in China in the c.LINK products, any sort of change in the dynamics of those markets in some of these newer technologies and then some of the broadband really start to reach 10-gig in the basement and other areas like that?","Most of the stuff we're seeing in China right now is that there is a commitment by the government to really try to strengthen the cable MSOs to be an alternative broadband access service provider to the major telcos. So, that kind of bodes well for what we are doing there. Coax is definitely the access solution of choice for the cable MSOs and there is a couple of different Ethernet-over-Coax technologies that are being trialed, our c.LINK access being one of those.

I think it might have even been more pronounced on the gas side.,"Probably was. Actually, I thought we were a little bit higher than consensus. And that would probably have been the impact from the Brent-like pricing that we're getting in the Eagle Ford, which is currently about $12 or $13 above WTI.

BIO,Q4,2016,"Got you. Thank you. That's very helpful. And just a follow-on to that question, I think earlier in the call you mentioned something about sort of three months to stabilize. What's the puts and takes that might affect that three months to, I don't know, be four months or two months or whatnot?","Yes. And so then I just want to clarify what that means in terms of stabilization. I think what John was talking about is the team that works on this project would like to move on to the next implementation. And we talk about this being our last major implementation and it is, because with this deployment, we will virtually have almost all of our manufacturing worldwide on SAP and what's left are sales operations that will roll out over time. But we would want to get the team quickly not needed anymore for the transition so that they can move on to the next implementation, which under the accounting terms means all that labor is capitalized instead of expensed. And that's kind of the risk to the P&L and the assumptions in the P&L. In terms of overall business stabilization, I think we've said in the past that that really takes almost a full year before people get really proficient of using SAP and taking advantage of SAP. And so, some of these redundancies that we have in head count and what we call backfill in the business, et cetera, they'll stay throughout much of 2017 to make sure that not only is the system working well, but people know how to take advantage of it.

With all the moving pieces, it's a little bit of a challenge to translate bookings to revenues. Any additional calls that you can provide thereon take rates and booking window are based on what you're seeing in July would be great. And then the second question. Can you talk about the supply acquisition campaigns on the global side? How has the supply side generally has been at and how should we think about the benefit of this translating into bookings, maybe in the back half and then also into next year? Thank you so much.","Don't know what happened there? Apologies. I think Eric cut out on us. Hopefully, you can still hear me. I'll just finish by saying that where he was going is the combination of mix has been really different during COVID, so it's a hard thing to tie back to historic levels. Air and other things were down more considerably than launching a car, etc. So, it's a little hard to give you much guidance there except to say, we expect to see continued mix shifts during this somewhat COVID period we are in. But we also believe that over time, and broadly, everything will revert to the in terms of mix and we should see more predictable take rates in that period.",1.0,1.0,2,1.0,0.0,1.0

And I would love to be able to give you more granular responses on what that projection would look like in Q3 and beyond. But the truth be told, that things are just moving around quite a bit when it comes to those booking windows and then from a take-rate standpoint, it's really going to depend on those mixes. And as Peter and I both mentioned, continues to be strong, we've seen conventional hotels come back. Sequentially, we've seen that in the air.

ANET,Q1,2020,"Great thanks for squeezing me in. A longer-term question as it relates to the enterprise. Has the nature of your conversations with your close enterprise customers changed at all? This may be a little bit premature.And the reason why I ask is, given that we're at a stay home, zero touch environment, one would have to think that the network automation, thesis should start playing out a little bit faster given that no can get to their networks anymore. How does that fit into customer conversations today?Do you think that will evolve? And especially given that you do have big switch that provides that enterprise -- hyperscale cloud-like environment to the enterprise that might be a positive to you guys in the long-term.","Yeah. No, Woo Jin, you really bring up a good point here. We tend to talk about data center and campus and all of these different use cases. But our customers are thinking more and more operationally. It's great to have a box. But how to ignite that box with the right operational capabilities is very, very important.And so when you look at it, you're absolutely right, day zero, day one, day two, zero touch automation, one click for the campus, data center, huge topic. The other one and this is why we bought Big Switch is not only are we igniting real-time streaming telemetry and cloud vision.But we're really extending that into the observability and network package relative space and we're very pleased with the sort of sum of data analyzer, cloud vision and now fix iCH to extend our dance monitoring fabric.So that trial or combination is going to be very important 50% energy so our enterprise conversations are going beyond that’s complete platform to much more operational automation analytics, availability and in the future security and segmentation as well.

In your case, I know you have been executing better there for the past several quarters. But, were there any specific large deals that drove your performance in Germany that could be categorized as non-recurring that we should think of going forward?","No, I think the German story for Tech Data is one, again, I mean the harp on it, but one of execution. We have set our sights and mapped out a plan of steady recovery in Germany and quite frankly the economic environment has slowed us down some, but the team continues to execute very-very well. There really aren’t any strange one-offs that are contributing to our success in Germany. It's just very-very solid execution and improvement in all fronts on the distribution model. We are managing our vendors efficiently, we are buying right, we are covering the right customers with an improved coverage model, and our management team has now had a handful of quarters now of stability to be able to really predict the business and drive it and you can see the results are beginning to take shape.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

Well, I think consistent with the discussions that we've had today. It's really about the new business and the time it takes to ramp that new business up. So the take up on the revenue side, it's going to have a little bit of drag on the margin.

Lot of credit we've picked up I think what we thought was a very strong management team with very complementary products, in some cases, where we overlap each other too much, and different strengths from a product perspective, and a customer base. You know, clearly the momentum that we are seeing recently is a function of that good integration, which was significant in the countries like India and Australia, where we both had a very large operations, and we are finding ourselves in a situation where we have got very healthy growth across IT products, and telephony products interestingly enough out of India so we are managing, because of some new products, and a new product category to do very well with that there. And clearly there is a lot of growth and expansion capability in what's called upcountry in India, which is outside the major metropolitan areas and we have a very good footprint. We are in sales offices in over 40 cities and over 30 distribution points. So that gives us a huge advantage compared to maybe some of our competitors are not as strong, or as broad and can't invest as much as we can. So a lot of vendors, and a lot of opportunities coming to us as a result of the good work and the infrastructure we have put in place there. And I wouldn't want to lose sight either of two or three other things that are happening in the region. In some of the smaller countries, they just don't get the mention nearly as much, whether that is Singapore or Malaysia or Thailand or New Zealand, we are seeing our company operate at levels better than our competitors. Again because the portfolio what we call carrier is fairly broad, the vendor community is extremely supportive of us, and the last I mentioned is really also made a big difference in the last year, year and a half from where we here lets say two years ago, three years ago, is that our China business, as we have mentioned to the Street and to all of you on calls, we went through a very significant change there two years back. And in fact pulled back on the size of the operations to get good controls and systems in place, and we put a great foundation in place with... leading that change, and since that change over the last 6 to 8 quarters, we have had excellent growth. Again, same situation as India, the breath of the portfolio increasing, the breath of country, cities sorry and territories is increasing, and that's giving us a chance to accelerate I think what we are seeing other companies do in the region.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TDC,Q1,2014,"Great, great. And one last one, you've obviously added over the last few quarters, even in Q3 last year, which was a tough quarter, you seem to be adding more net new customers. Could you just provide a little color? Typically, those customers have had an average deal size of $1.5 million or so, and then they've typically ramped over 4 years to double and so on and so forth. Did those trends remain in place or are you adding customers, as you might have mentioned, with lower ASPs? And so maybe that sort of doubling every 4 years or couple of years from their analytical environments is less of a pattern?","Our new customer wins have been very, very good the last couple of years and it continues to trend extremely well. When we look at the mix of customers we're adding, some of them we can mention by name and we've mentioned them on the -- in the prepared remarks. We are adding at a pretty good clip what I would call global Fortune 500, global Fortune 1000 customers and that's new customers. And that's helping our growth outside the top 50 in the Americas and also worldwide. In terms of average deal sizes, I think they've remained fairly consistent, but the larger... The initial deals.

Just from your historical perspective to date, how long has it taken in terms of generation devices before you become a lead supplier to any new customer? Does it take 1 or 2 generations before you become the lead supplier? Or could it take more time than that?","Well, I think if you're referring to the cellular design wins we've talked about, in the LitePoint case, in the WiFi side of Lite, we very quickly moved to a dominant position. But we were moving in at a time when the market was also nascent and exploding, like LitePoint was. So we rode a wave and had a strong position. Here, we're coming into an established market. And because of the rapid product life cycles that Greg mentioned, it's actually possible to move into a high share position within 1- or 2-generation design cycle, which is a 1- or 2-year period. If the product life cycles were quite long, like SemiTest's 3 years, there's a much slower share-move strategy. But here, it can move more quickly.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Lowell, just curious, how do the unions kind of feel about this? Do you have the flexibility to kind of really converge these networks on a timely basis? Thank you.
","OK. Tim, thanks for the question, and I'd just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes. First on customer data. Our hallmark on this, Tim, is transparency.
We don't want to use data though I -- unless customers know how we're using it. And so far, we've been able to do broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data, but overall data. And I think that that anonymous usage, we're very clear with customers about, and it's certainly got a lot of value to the old facets. On the convergence side, we're honoring the contract within the footprint, and we're very open with the union about what we're doing and we're very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward.
So we're -- again, transparency is important to us. We think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any footfalls and we're open about it. We don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.

So in absolute terms, overhead only went up for technology by 3 million. So overhead -- I'm sorry; the whole company's technology spend only went up by 3 million. Within our overhead, it looks like a $27 million increase. It is offset primarily in the children's books, with a decrease in spend.

Yeah, I think we’ve sort of talked about little bit about middle of the calendar year that we had digested in the prior time a number of events and I think we got our footing and you can have some packages and made some adjustments to the fact we can’t buy ad time on media that will sell ad time and the like and got our mojo back and sort of I think they have done a good job and look we got a better package.

I mean, I think about what's happened over the course of the last 12 months, you have acquired ortho sensor, you did touch on a little bit of the knee in a box and ASP knee opportunity there and then obviously robotics is getting a lot of attention in the ASPs in the outpatient setting. So maybe just that will set us on expectations into the conference?","Yes, listen, we don't have a big reveal at this conference. As you say we'll talk about the conformance product and we can talk about Triathlon AS-I, we have Mako, which is still going to be talked about quite a bit, especially with the new hip application that's starting to gain some steam, but still takes time to get that socialized more broadly. In addition to that, we have recent approval of the in space balloon for large rotator cuff repair within our sports medicine business, which is a very exciting product and a product used by sports medicine surgeons as well as the surgeons that do shoulder arthroplasty that come from Wright Medical. So that's also an exciting product, so as well as to perform Humeral product that Glenn mentioned earlier on with Wright Medical.

So a number of new products, but it's really, frankly, an exciting time to get back with our customers at scale, not having that conference last year was certainly a gap and really look forward to engaging with our customers once again.

SYK,Q2,2021,"Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned there is at least 6% growth in trauma and extremities, is that the growth of the overall market, because I know the E part of that is growing faster than the T part, is that the overall growth in that overall category combined? And then, as you think about going forward typically that nine to 18-month period is when you start to see the most dislocation from a product and a rep perspective is trauma and extremities different than what we see across traditional orthopedic acquisitions just because there's fewer places for some of these reps to go. So maybe the dislocation that you see could be a little less than we typically see?","Yes, I think the way things are playing out right now the dislocation is less than spine. Certainly, that's been our experience. It's been a pleasant surprise so far, and especially on the foot and ankle side where we had anticipated a bit more dislocation. And frankly, we have terrific products. And we provided really quick stability for our salespeople to know who their boss is, to know what their territory is. And so, we moved with more speed this time, learned some lessons from prior integrations. I would tell you that we think we're growing at least at the market, if not above the market, because you have to remember that at least 6% is for the full year, including a pretty depressed first quarter, right.

So the first quarter of this year was not kind of a normal year as it relates to the extremities business at all. So to have that over the full year, at least 6% on a combined basis I think that's probably growing above the market and we'll see as the year progresses.

And I have one quick followup.","Hey Matt, it is Preston. Just in terms of robots and mix, I mean one of the things that we identified approximately a year ago was that we were starting to see a bit of a trend towards financing. We haven't seen any significant changes in that approach or in that mix for the last year, so no big changes from a mix standpoint as we think about Mako and how we're selling Mako in the market.

","No I think I'd say it's equally from EMC as well as NetApp and I would say HP as well. So the top four vendors for us have all almost sort of a reaction to e-serve all becomes much more price aggressive.

CTAS,Q1,2008,"Great. And do you have any plants, laundry facility either openings or greenfield openings or closings?","No closings, we certainly have a few plants that will be opened this year.

RHT,Q3,2013,"Great. And just a follow-up on Red Hat Storage, I know you've had a lot of active proof of concepts. How close are you to starting to convert some of the POCs to revenues, and can you at least characterize what your expectations may be, if not quantify, over the next year what you expect from Red Hat Storage?","That's not the large healthcare deal, that's a different one.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"Great. And just a follow-up on Red Hat Storage, I know you've had a lot of active proof of concepts. How close are you to starting to convert some of the POCs to revenues, and can you at least characterize what your expectations may be, if not quantify, over the next year what you expect from Red Hat Storage?","Yes, well, we now had several of those POCs turn into 6-figure deals, frankly not 7-figure but 6-figure deals. So we're feeling it's too early to really say what the conversion rate is going to be on the POCs. But overall, we're pleased with that. And recognize there are 2 steps to turning it into revenue. First is you got to get a booking, and then the booking's got to roll into revenue over time. So the plan that we walk through for next year with you still is relatively light on the dollars that'll flow into revenue from Storage. We expand -- we expect to close quite a few more deals, but they're still going to be in the low 6-figures, high 5-figures for a while as people kind of get used to it, use it more and work to build them up over time. And then obviously, they'll have to roll into revenue 12 months after that.We have a new very interesting use case this quarter of a very large pharmaceutical company that has massive storage requirements and was looking for a less expensive, more accessible way to store information, and they've chosen to do Red Hat Storage. So that's a whole new avenue for us as well.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Great. And last question, just from an innovation standpoint, can you just provide any context on kind of what's remaining in terms of innovation this year and how things are going to work in 2021, if there is any clarity you can provide on the launch timing?","Yeah. So we feel very good about our innovation, some of the innovations that we are excited about that are new to the market, includes the Reese pretzel product, a Reese cup with pretzels in it. We've had a range of Kit-Kat flavors. We know on a global basis, a big part of the Kit-Kat portfolio are flavors, they tend to do quite well. We are, on a very small level launching Snack Cakes under our Reese's trademark, which delivers that Reese experience in a slightly different type of product form and we feel good on that versus basis some of the early test results.
And we will have more coming, some items on our take-home side of our business that won't get announced till early next year, which is typically the time we announce those things just given resent windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very well for us. We think it's right sized and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0

FOSL,Q1,2018,"Great. And one follow-up, if I may. I know that the hybrid is clearly a competitive advantage for you guys but maybe a little tougher for the consumer to understand versus the display screen watch. I guess kind of what progress have you made in educating the consumer on hybrid and how should we think about that longer-term opportunity? Thanks.","Well, as we said before in our own environment, our own stores and e-comm, we continue to see hybrid's doing well and increasing as a percentage of the total.

BIO,Q4,2016,"Great. And perhaps one for Norm, could you sort of educate us on what the budget process was like coming into 2017, how it might have differed from prior years and to the extent that that process has given you better visibility or granularity into exactly where all the cost opportunities are once the ERP go-live is finished?","Yes, Brandon, this is John. I'll take that. Yes, we've been thinking about 2017 for, let's say, more than the last couple of months, I'll put it that way. We've organized the approach to look at improvements across the board, starting in our supply chain area, and we have very specific targeted projects that we've got in mind there. We've also taken a very detailed look at our OpEx spending and we've really tied that right down to location, head count, and the needs in which we see ourselves in. So, largely, as we think about 2017, for me and the organization, it's to get through this go-live in Europe, which we've got scheduled for early April, get that stabilized in three months' time, and then begin the process of shedding costs associated with that and moving onto the next smaller deployments going forward. So those for me are the really key aspects of it. And then, with respect to top line planning, accelerating growth is really part and parcel to getting our ship righted here. And we're pretty optimistic, I think as Christine alluded to, about the coming periods.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
MNST,Q3,2012,Great. And that’s great. And then one point of clarification here you talked about the board making a decision on the share repurchase authorization. Is it safe to say that none of the sort of noise going around that you talked about at the beginning of the call impacts your ability to repurchase stock or to authorize another repurchase program?,We don’t believe so. But obviously we need to be advised by our lawyers but we don’t think so.,2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"Great. And then I had a quick follow-up on gross margins. One probably for Devinder. You guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46%, and then 45% for the full year.
I appreciate your semi-custom business is at a low point in Q1, and a ramp in Q2, and more so in the second half, it's probably dilutive to corporate margins. But if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year, that would be helpful. And then related to that, if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi-custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle, product cycle, that would be helpful. Thank you.
","Yeah, let me start, and then Lisa can chime in. Overall, from a margin standpoint, you got it right. We are guiding to the 46% in the Q1 quarter. And then the semi-custom business, as we've said, typically, is lower than corporate average.
So, as that product ramps in the second half, obviously, will have an impact on gross margin. The guide for the year is at 45%, so we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43% level. And from a puts and takes standpoint, it's certainly product mix. And then Lisa talked about the business is ramping and growing in 2020 with the 28 to 30% growth in revenue.
Data center, as we've said before, is above corporate average. The client gross margin is around corporate average, and some graphics. And then the semi-custom business has below corporate average gross margins. And that mix of revenue, as it ramps throughout the year, will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis.
From an annual standpoint, we feel pretty good with the guide at 45%, in particular, with the seven-nanometer products ramping as we get to the year. And that, obviously, benefits the gross margin. Semi-custom business, Lisa, you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation?

Thank you.
","Yeah. No, I think as you said, Devinder, the semi-custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis. Although, on an operating margin basis, given the contribution from our customers for the R&D, is actually quite good. As it relates to generation to generation, the way to think about it is, in the first year of a console ramp, you would expect the margins to be on the lower side, and that's, you know, that's true no matter what, just because you're just starting the product ramp, and you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
SANM,Q4,2012,"Great. And then a quick question – follow-up, probably for Bob. On the other income expense line, I believe you guided that could be approximately $13 million to $15 million. Is that kind of a good run rate or is there some timing to where that’s going to keep going down lower in the future? Thank you, gentlemen.","Yeah, so at this point, I think that’s a reasonable run rate to assume. As you know, that particular line item just inherently has volatility because we have miscellaneous things that show up there. But I think the $13 million to $15 million range is a good way to think about it throughout FY 2013.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Great. And then as a follow-up -- follow-up actually on Bryan Spillane's question about freight costs. I remember back in 2018, as freight cost spiked back then, that provided a bit of a headwind for you. It's seems as though it's not so much of a problem this time around. Are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of COGS freights actually represent and how much of that has already contracted out and what you've learned since 2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable. Thank you","Sure. So yeah freight cost right now, we don't see as a material impact. If it continues to rise, it will have a bigger impact right now, again, because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts. It's not having as material of an impact. It's roughly 10% of COGS overall and so it's not immaterial, but right now, not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material impact on overall COGS.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
OCX,Q1,2020,Great. And then just a final question on sales force headcount. Where are you now and where might you be around the beginning of the year with perhaps a commercial IO as well as DX?,"Yes. So because IO today is really focused in pharma, we have a small team including myself that actually – and Doug that are going after the pharma opportunities based on our history and knowledge of the people there and we’ve got a lot of experience there. Our commercial team selling RX today is six folks with a leader. We chose the high incident rate areas that we believe we could reach that would give us some immediate upswing. The idea has always been that once we grow those current territories to a certain level, we would add another round of reps. And the goal is to responsibly add reps without impacting cash burn. So the idea would be to try to build reps up until they’re covering their cost and adding to the accretion to the business. And then we would go use that accretion to go build out the next round of sales force. Should we get an early immune-oncology CMS approval which we aren’t committing to, but should that happen, I reserve the right to come back and change that. But right now, that’s the plan.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
ACAT,Q1,2012,"Great. And then just in terms of Wildcat, can you give us any early data in terms of how sell-through has gone? And ultimately, as I think about your guidance for next year, how significant is Wildcat in that guidance? What’s sort of the year one assumptions there?","Yeah, we don’t breakout individual data on individual models. So I can’t give you a lot of detail there. The guidance that we’ve provided on the ATV business, which includes side-by-sides as well of Wildcats, we said would be up anywhere from 26% to 32%; that’s over a year that we just completed. And so when we looked at the year we just completed, ATV sales were up 25%. So up 25% the year we just completed and next year we’re saying 26% to 32%. So, overall, I’d say it’s – you can break them down into three buckets, but there’s no doubt that that’s having the biggest amount of impact of the three categories in our ATV business.
In terms of guidance, I think the guidance we’ve provided takes into consideration – the Wildcat sell-through has been going very well. But as we have mentioned before, our objective was not just take orders and ship the orders. We shipped the product. We took orders, we shipped some product and we wanted to see how retails were going and retails are going very well. So we’ve continued to go ahead and ship.
You can see in terms of overall inventory, we continue to watch that very closely. And we don’t want to go ahead and ship based on initial orders. We’d rather go ahead and see how the market’s reacting and then ship based on retails.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
TECD,Q4,2008,"Great. And then just on Brightstar you guys have, it sounds that you have got some momentum there, you made money in quarter. How much is that joint venture being influenced by net books at this point both from growth and profitability share point?","Actually, technically on net books very little, however, the joint venture is selling small notebooks to various carriers. So the net books will probably be upside going forward, there are European opportunities to sell notebook and net books to carriers as they begin to subsidize that as an increment tool putting in their card in it. But it certainly helped, but I think the momentum on handsets as we indicated on the call, that we believe we had about 20% market share in Q4 in handsets alone in UK and Spain, pretty impressive performance considering it was a startup operation two years ago.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
ICD,Q1,2020,Great. And then just one last follow-up. Do you expect to be EBITDA positive during the second -- during the remainder of the year?,It's going to depend on how many rigs are running Kurt and we just don't know the answer to that. If it's less than six that's going to be a challenge. If it's more than six then we've got a chance to do that. But it's going to -- there's a lot of variables in that.,2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
CTXS,Q3,2020,"Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Dave on the Americas comment being down 1% year-over-year, is it right to assume that most of the SSP contribution comes into the Americas number, so if you exclude that it was actually up 3%, 3.5%?","Without doing the math, I think the first part of the question is absolutely correct, almost 100% of it would come in Americas.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SXC,Q1,2014,"Great. And then last question, in terms of the timing of the final permit for the new coke plants, what is the milestone we should look out for?","I think we're expecting at any time now, actually. We did submit -- in the first quarter, actually north -- getting into the first quarter, we submitted all of the responses to the public comments. The public comments were actually pretty straightforward. And now it's just grinding through the system. In the meantime, the dialogue, the discussion -- all of the 5 customers were for blast furnace coke, 3 of them are already our customers. So we've been talking with the customers about what we're doing here, what we might be prepared to do, the kind of terms we could offer, the multiplant, which could be different. I mean, historically, to a steel-making customer who's dealt with us, they signed up for 15- or 20-year terms for 550,000 tons. We don't believe that one customer is going to take 550,000 tons. We think this plan is likely to be multi-customer. I think that the really serious discussions can even -- can accelerate as we have that permit in hand. I would say, lastly, we're using the time to finish our engineering work. Because generally, when we sign up a customer, at that point, the capital risk is ours, so we want to try to finish the engineering work to try to minimize the risk we might have that the pricing cost will be higher than we expect.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
RRD,Q4,2012,"Great. And then maybe just the last one is for the guidance for the year. I mean, if we just assume the economy ranges the same, which I know is a big assumption, but if you could just maybe walk through like which of your segments or end markets or regions, which in your mind is the biggest swing factor this year, either beating or missing that guidance? What should we be focused on? What are you focused on?","Dan will take you through that, but the one thing I want to also emphasize, as you think about the economy and what Dan Knotts, George Zengo, the rest of the team -- look, a tough economy should be a good day for RR Donnelley because our customers are going to continue to look to get costs out of their platform. We don't change the way we run the business no matter what's going on with the economy, but hopefully, our customers will be able to show them the impact that we can bring to their platform as a result of the cost savings we can give to them, how we can improve their return on their investments and how we can make their market communications more powerful for what they're doing, so...",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

What should we be focused on? What are you focused on?","Yes, I'll just add a couple of comments. I mean, the first is, if you look at the guidance and to the question of taking down the pension return, which has an impact of $24 million or so, the rebate adjustments that we had in 2012 and those 2 items, x those items, it's essentially a flat level of performance. We look at -- and it's interesting. We talk a lot about the product groups that we talk about. Tom spent a fair amount of time talking about the benefit that we get outside of just a product focus than more of a solution sale. We feel very comfortable how we do head-to-head on a product sale, but really, this is all about doubling the broader set of solutions that draw in the products. But having said that, going back to the product description, in the beginning of the year, financial, obviously, off to a nice start given the capital markets. From a full year perspective, I would, from a modeling view, would look at things performing similarly to how they performed in 2012. We're not banking on a drastic recovery in any one of the product lines. This is really consistent performance with what we saw in 2012.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
OSUR,Q3,2020,Great. And then maybe one for Roberto. We saw gross margins came in at 63%. It's definitely a nice contributor to flipping the model back to profitable fourth quarter. I was curious if you could comment on that level of margins given the increasing mix of molecular collection and the expected continued momentum behind this business?,"Sure. So, you correctly deduced that the driver of that is the COVID-19 products and we continue to expect those to be growing contributors to our revenues. So versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter we expect gross margin to be at least as good as the third quarter and likely a bit better given the historical seasonality in our commercial genomics business. There will be some moderation to the gross margin as we see continued growth in our HIV international business, which is a lower gross margin business. But we do overall see this as a sustainable gross margin level that will see some seasonality from quarter-to-quarter in the coming year.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
UNVR,Q1,2017,"Great. And then on the pricing environment you are seeing, we had kind of a tailwind in chemical price inflation in the first quarter. And some of your end markets, you are probably still seeing some increase; I think caustic soda is still on the rise. But then maybe some other areas with more petrochemical chains, some of those have started to roll over, where do you see pricing in the second quarter developing for you guys?","I mean on that, your guess is probably as good as ours if you are into this space. We roll with -- we take the punches and roll with them. We try to stay ahead of them and make sure that whichever way they go, it's positive for us. We like them going up more than we like them going down. But we manage through both. And like I said earlier what we like are dynamics rather than steady state. So we're not -- we don't worry about that. We just adapt to it. And we adapt very quickly. And I think I can tell you that we are far more nimble today than we were about a year ago. With that, I think we are ready to close out. I want to thank you all for joining us today and also remind you that we do have Investor Day on the 15th of May in New York.

TECD,Q4,2008,"Great. And then on your previous conference call, that wasn't very prudent to provide go forward target given the current economy and FX volatility. I am just kind of curious what’s changed and what are you seeing out there now that makes you a little bit more comfortable in providing an outlook, albeit it's still somewhat vague?","Well, I think the point that we provided was a directional point. If you take the interaction of that client in the market plus currency volatility, and as Bob said in his comments we have vendor saying the market is down between 5% and 25%. We just kind of, our various models and renditions from our high to our low revenue estimates, we keep triangulating between the market decline and currency around a 20% decline. So, we are just giving you sort of a parameter to work with.

Last call, we said we didn’t know whether the market was going to be flat down 5% or down 10%, and so it's kind of an update to the color that was given in our Q3 call. I think if you even look back to our Q1 call this past year, we started talking about looking at the market was softening. So it is not meant to be a pin-point estimate that we are going to be down exactly 20%, but it is clearly to just give you an idea that 20% decline on year-over-year basis is certainly likely in this market.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Just two weeks ago we had about 15 of our biggest customers together for a day to kind of get a feeling for where they felt the market was headed. And you get a set of data points and then we counteract that with for example, the Sharp announcement we made this morning which is all really incremental revenue opportunity for Tech Data or the fact that we have now opened the Brightstar JV into Germany, that’s all incremental upside and it’s hard for us to predict how much value and how much revenue and profit that can contribute. But clearly those steps that we take or we constantly take to try to find new market opportunities, diversify technologies and to find new customers, we have to balance that off with the input we get from our customers and vendors about their outlooks into the markets.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And then the second question is, I think earlier, you noted that, when physicians do move procedures to the outpatient or the ASP they're typically using their, standard instrumentation sets or the same implant systems that use in the hospital, have you seen any changes in pricing or types of contracting that you're seeing, when your ASC team does go out to engage on driving initiatives there?","No, thus far, we're not seeing really any change in implant pricing. But we, what we are seeing is because of the capital requirement; we are seeing deals that involve multiple businesses of Stryker. We're seeing much more of that than we see in the hospitals. So the deals that we do typically involve four or five different businesses, and Stryker, whereas hospitals tend to buy product category by product category, but no real change on pricing.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
ROLL,Q4,2015,"Great. And then, for your gross margins, I mean, historically you guys have guided to about a 1% gross margin improvement in an annual basis. When we think about the business, maybe without Sargent on a go-forward basis, is that 1% still what we should be looking at? And then now with Sargent, what should that 1% look like?","Well, I think the 1% is still good for the base business and we have some really good programs that are maturing now and starting to show their strength.

SYK,Q2,2021,"Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Just for Wright Medical, you're saying you're confident that the combined business will grow at least 6% this year. Can you just speak to any more detail around sort of the recent drivers in this business? Are you guys seeing any benefit from dislocation associated with the recent impact of the spin off? And then, I guess, is there any reason why that 6% couldn't be 8% to 10% growth next year?","Yes, thanks, Kaila. What I'd tell you is we're really excited about the upper extremities business, it was growing very, very fast before, the acquisition that's continuing to really sing, especially in the United States. And we've just launched a new product, which will provide extra fuel to the fire. And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle was going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective, those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer and we knew that these countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride.

But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis, and we sort of moved it up to mid single and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be six plus percent for this year. And you should assume if this continues, and the elective procedures on the lower extremities ramps up that we should have a very good year next year. And also our core trauma business is actually having a very good year as well. So overall feeling very good about it. We're not going to give guidance for next year, but I think you can tell by our total network feeling very optimistic about the future of our trauma and extremities business.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I know that we still have an enormous amount of business that has not been outsourced yet. And as you look out into the future, I am just wondering how much can you think you can capture that? What is the underlying churn? It almost seems like you guys are taking share from each other in the business and that there is just not a lot of new big and large opportunities coming out. So I would love some perspective on the industry dynamics as it stands currently? Thanks.","Yes. Mike, I will try to answer your question in the short time frame here that we have. But I think first thing, just stepping a way back, if you read the industry regs and depending on what source you look at, whether it's in Gartner or Forrester or so forth, so on, I think in general consensus you will see where they are projecting the outsourced industry to grow around 4% to 5%. Also keep in mind that when you look at the sheer size of the number of people that have worked in the industry in totality, it's around 8 million people today. And out of that 8 million people, they are estimating that somewhere around 15% to 20% is outsourced.

So those are the numbers and things that we look and study. Now obviously you have variances within different geographies around the world. The U.S. is at a different pace than maybe what you would experience in Brazil and so forth so on. But in general without having a global perspective, a global footprint, we do look at that number as a good benchmark for us to measure ourselves against. Also within there though, you do have to look at the differences within each industry. And this is where it gets to be a little challenging, I think particularly for someone where you are sitting.

I mean it's challenging enough for us in trying to get a good understanding of the market opportunity and things, but technology is a big user of outsourcing. So it's very fair to say that they are probably outsourcing almost half of their business, maybe even more. Credit card companies have been bigger consumers of outsourcing, more so than retail banking.

Communications, particularly in wireless, has probably outsourced close to 40% to 50% of their business. So healthcare is maybe 10%.. And as you look around at the different industries and the different countries you are in, depending where you are trying to target, it's going to effect the overall dynamics and the intensity the competition in there.

Now Sykes is really looking at the communications, the financial services, the technology, the healthcare, those big four. We do operate in transportation and we do report on that. We do also operate in retail but the ones that we see really moving the needle for us is communication, finance, technology and healthcare. And within communications, you are absolutely right. We have a lot of insurance competition there. It is a fight for account share and your performance and making sure you can protect your base.

But it's also been, for communications, the industry overall for the last several years has seen nice growth as we look at what has taken place in the world of digital and mobility. So that has been an intense area, but it's a place that's given us growth because the market overall has been growing. Now as you read and you start seeing a slowdown in the intensity of the mobility uptake rate or the number of new devices or as we alluded to in our comments around communications, even the intensity within that industry amongst those suppliers will effect the overall volumes that we are receiving.

And to put that in perspective, some of our companies, our clients that we serve in the wireless side, last year alone made over 10 changes to their billing plans, just to give you an indication of the state of competitiveness. That's significant for us because billing questions are probably the number one driver for the wireless sector that we serve. So we ever see changes in that or more stable outlook, it will effect the growth going forward. So there is a lot of dynamics there and things are taking place.

Financial services was one where we do have intense competition in credit card, but we do see in retail banking an area where banks are looking to outsource, embrace outsourcing in a more aggressive way and we see that as being a little more new business for us. And it's something that we still think as a company, we have a lot of growth potential in that sector, which is why you saw us taking actions last year to continue bringing in new leadership to help us take advantage of that.

Technology, for us, as a company was our first place we started. It went somewhat through a maturity cycle when mobility came up and tablet computing and started changing. But now in technology, we have this group we refer to more as new tech, the new businesses that are emerging and we are starting to break into some of those. And I think you saw into the quarter, where in John's comment, 29% quarter-over-quarter growth. So we are certainly excited by that and we think we have new potential there. And that's new business, because these companies are growing so rapidly and relatively new that they are just now beginning to outsource.

And then healthcare is one where again maybe it's a 10%, 15%, similar to retail banking, but again with all the changes in healthcare and the new business models that are emerging, we do believe there is going to be more and more opportunities for us there to find more growth channels.

So that's about just as a general commentary the framework. I mean it's a deep dive. That's almost an all-day discussion if you really wanted to get comfortable probably. But I think this will give you feel about, it is more than just taking account share from each other. There are disruptions that are taking place around the world and within these four industries that are causing new opportunities for new growth. It isn't all just about head-to-head competition.

But one of the thing that is a little challenging in our business is how quickly we can move in the brick-and-mortar environment and even though I am talking to you about these numbers, when we receive volume reduction forecast, it's just not the kind of thing that we can always be in a position that we can transfer that business, retrain, capture new business, get it up and running at the same time. It is pretty operationally intensive to be able to do that.

And right now we have someone, I will just say in acute situation with the volume forecast that we got from a number of companies in the communications sector and it's a bit faster than our ability to go and take some of these other programs and get it replaced. So I wouldn't let our numbers, sort of the things that we just guided to, or the changes in our outlook on revenue change your view of the growth prospects for companies like Sykes in this industry. It's a very large industry and I think there is going to be good growth opportunities for some time.

We are not talking about crazy growth. We are not talking about running consistently double digits. We have always for us, that we can run at the market pace, 4% to 5% is what the market is, we have always said 4% to 6% and that's really net growth when you think about it, because it's gross adds minus whatever's going on with your current volume of business. And we have been able to do that for the last couple of years. We had 5.7% and 7.4% and then this year it's turning out to be a little flat for us right now. But over the course of three years, we are holding our own out there relative to the market.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

ROST,Q3,2016,"Great. Thank you so much. Michael, I wanted to just ask about wage inflation and SG&A leverage. It seems like the leverage point today, perhaps, starting in the third quarter, sits a little bit higher because of the wage increases. So I’m wondering if you can just talk to your -- what comp you need to leverage SG&A in a normal environment? And it seems like starting in the third quarter and continuing maybe through the first half of ‘17 that comp needed is a bit higher because of the incremental wages, could you just talk us through that?","Sure, Kimberly. The third quarter levered by 5 basis points on the 7% comp. As we mentioned in our comments, that was partly driven by wages and that really hasn’t changed from the first part of the year but it was also impacted by one-time non-recurring charges we took in the quarter. So I’d say the leverage point change in the quarter was those non-recurring costs. At this point, we continue to believe, at least in the next couple of years that the leverage point continues to be about 3%.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
HAS,Q1,2021,"Great. Thank you very much for the question, and good morning. I just have two. First, could you talk a little bit more about the TV deliveries that are happening at eOne in the second half? Any sense of major shows that should be bigger contributors to revenue? And then second, given the strong margin performance in the quarter, could you talk about your current expectations for EBIT margins for the full year? Thank you very much."," And as far as our EBIT margins, I mean, the first quarter is generally a smaller quarter. At this point, we don't see anything that changes our full-year outlook. Our demand has been strong, and we have positive trends in Consumer Products and whether it's in Digital Gaming business, and Brian just talked about entertainment. So we're confident that, that segment can continue to deliver as well.
And so together, we can -- it can all deliver double-digit revenue growth for us for the year. But as we said in February, we're targeting operating margins in line with our last year's adjusted level of around 15%. Demand has been strong and that helped support it, but the impact of freight and input cost increases has become more pronounced over the past several months. We do have plans in place to help mitigate those costs, including price increases for the second half of the year, and we're actively working with our vendors, suppliers and customers.

And then second, given the strong margin performance in the quarter, could you talk about your current expectations for EBIT margins for the full year? Thank you very much."," Sure. Good morning, Mike. On the first question, we're really seeing an array of TV series that are in production for eOne as well as a number of films. We talked about that on our prepared remarks.
And we're beginning those deliveries, including The Rookie, Cruel Summer, which we just launched on Freeform, a couple of films and increasing television deliveries throughout the year. In fact, by Q2, we expect to see the growth that we've been talking about. And our expectation for the full year also remains the same, which is the Entertainment business should grow double digits in revenue and return on television and film revenues to the levels that we saw back in 2019. As we move beyond that, as we look at long-term plans, we now believe in the continued growth of eOne's business over the longer term, and we're really seeing the Hasbro IP begin to take hold.
In fact, this -- right now, we're already on preproduction with a planned launch of production in the next few months on the D&D, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS film. We've got TRANSFORMERS both television and film, MY LITTLE PONY. This feature animated CG film comes out in September on Netflix. POWER RANGERS, we have both the TV series and film that we'll talk about going to a platform very shortly.
We also have some great creative stewards on a brand like Risk that will be coming in a future period. So the Hasbro IPs are being actively developed in the television and films well under production. We continue to use COVID protocols right now, and we believe those will dissipate as the situation continues to get better.

BIO,Q4,2016,"Great. Thank you. And I also appreciate all the detail in the prepared remarks, so thanks for that. My first question, on the path to, Norman, as you said, mid-teens or higher operating margin, could you give us at least in broad brush strokes more detail on the components and the timing? Because if you assume mid-teens operating margin on your 2016 revenue base, that is $165 million in additional operating profit. I'm just trying to track down where all that would come from.","So I think it comes from a couple of places. Certainly, the sales growth, and I think as John said, we set the course for sales growth not only for 2017 but for the next few years. And that's, of course, one of the principal drivers. And then, as we go down the balance sheet, I think as we've called out a number of times, our SG&A is on the high side compared to our peers, and we really circled in on very tight control over SG&A for the next few years to help drive those margins. So, as we go forward and see, and are planning now and working on how we harvest the benefits of the SAP system, and some of these other investments that we've made, I think that's really where it all comes from.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

You've talked about a $30 million-plus opportunity for the residential broadband. Can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of POPs covered over the next 12, 24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more. We've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets they're launched this year. How rapidly you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave? Or you're going to use some lower bands for the mobility 5G? Thank you.
","Yes. Thank you, Simon. This is Hans. So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, as we've said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning [Inaudible].
We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the NR standard that is coming out right now. And then there is again equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the material to be released to our customers. So that -- so that will come back when we go for the full 30 million households, which is our ambition that we have explained before.
So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access. On the mobility, we do the same. Remember, the intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network. So it's same radio base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility.
So we are, and as I said before -- I mean, we are now in deployment of fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the maturity of the equipment and the softwares as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products. And right now that's the ambition we've seen in 2019. We have not named the cities, but as you can hear we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber.
So I think that's an important point of it. That's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we are doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston.

EXPE,Q2,2021,"Great. Thank you. I think we're all trying to figure out what your earnings can look like on the other side of this, and so the market share is important. People are going to compare you're down 26% bookings versus to booking, which is in the low double-digits. So just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about market share in your core U.S. and Europe markets right now. And second, maybe you can explain some of the differences, maybe your percent of air bookings or how much of your bookings are international versus domestic. Thank you.
","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Justin and I will just say so a couple of things to think about there. First of all, as I mentioned, broadly, when you look at conventional lodging plus press we believe our position is stronger in the U.S. than pre - COVID. But, again, that's not the same for all markets. And if you look at a market like EMEA, which came back strong over the summer and came back principally in domestic, that obviously favors some of the other players. And our business in places like EMEA and APAC, as I mentioned, is more international focused. Now that goes to airlift as well because we're very good at delivering long-haul air, which has been virtually non-existent during the COVID period. So, you've seen again, a bunch of these principles at play where we've benefited from some. Others had benefited from others. And we generally believe that international will be the next major thing to open up and that favors our position in many of those markets, and we and we will see that rebound through that side of our business and through the air and all the pieces that are attached to that. But that's really what's going on in market share more than anything, is this a domestic versus international extra start. There are also more bookings into small markets as people have stayed domestic and gone to the equivalent in the U.S. is a small motel near national park etc., that has not been a traditional strength of ours. We have been better in big cities. Big cities have lagged somewhat",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

That’s not robbing from future quarters, so our forward-looking quarters have stayed consistent and actually have come up a bit. And so it is upside demand. It’s not stealing from future quarters.

I think for the sales force itself, yes that's a good rule of thumb. However, we are putting additional investment in hub services to really smooth the process of a patient from the doctor deciding that they want some MACI implant to getting insurance approval, so it will be a bit higher than when you saw in the past and that's why we gave a fairly specific numbers saying, hey, I think what we did this quarter and over a couple quarters ramp it up until we get about $2 million higher a quarter.

Now, you're net cash-positive. I didn't think back then we'd expect you to be here. But how should we think about capital structure going forward? And the -- and for the $400 million -- 440 million in cash flow from operations, I had a challenge reconciling it. Can you share the biggest two or three sources of cash? And then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining -- once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at two or three or 4% 400-basis-point clip per quarter.
How should, you know, what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle?

Is it capacity from your suppliers, is it your own engineering support infrastructure, or is it your customers testing and importing workloads? If you could give us a framework to think about that, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.
","Yeah, let me get started, Mark. You do have a long memory, and so do I. I do remember the days when we had the challenge on the balance sheet. And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet, and in particular, the net cash position.
We haven't been in many, many years, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks. You know, From a capital structure standpoint, the priority is investing in the business. The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we're projecting at 28 to 30% over 2019. And also, we want to invest in the roadmap, the go to market and everything that's needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year over year, so that's really the allocation priorities.
From a viewpoint of where the 440 million comes from, you know, higher revenue, especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year. We did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue. And as you know, when you sell that revenue, in particular, when it ramps up, you know, as it did on better margins, it generates the cash, and that's why you have the 440 million-plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint.

","Yeah. So, Mark, as it relates to, you know, just server rate and pace. I think the most important thing for us is when we look at, you know, from time of announcement or time of shipment to, you know, how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle. So, when I look at the difference between, let's call it, Rome and Naples, we've seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome.
And so, in terms of rate and pace of server share gain, it is primarily for cloud customers. It is having them deployed, not just, you know, sort of a set of instances, but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world, and also adding additional workloads. So, it's just, you know, time, is what I would say. And then, as it relates to enterprise customers, I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples.
And so, I'm quite encouraged actually by the strength of the pipeline that we see, the number of customers that are engaged, and then just, you know, how they're deploying. So, I think we're going at a good pace, and we'll continue to accelerate that as we go through, you know, 2020.

How's that trending and how are you trying to think about that ahead of the winter? And then as you look out in terms of the international clever recovery, I mean, have your thoughts changed? You even see countries like Iceland and Israel that are really highly vaccinated dealing with higher spikes, higher case cascade. How has the change in the interim, how do you view the international recovery if it looks like we're going to have to change, a multitude of different government policies towards COVID? Thank you.
","Yeah. Thanks, Jed. I think I believe the second one first. It's, It's frustrating and confusing and complicated. Countries have taken different approaches even within the EU, where we spend a lot of time with the EU commissioners about trying to synthesize the rules and make them consistent because people traveling within the -- who have issues with what the protocols are. So, it remains a big unknown. I would say we know that vaccines are definitely the biggest part of the answer, at least that we can see so far and of course there's lots of work going on, and other treatment protocols, etc. for COVID. I think we will continue to see improvements and, ultimately, COVID will be something the world learns to live with. And people will be traveling again, so we're starting to see international travel. It's not 0. We're starting to see conversations. Today U.S. government was quoted that Biden is considering opening up to the U.S. to foreign travelers who are vaccinated. So, I think we'll continue to see that push as countries want to get their tourism businesses back and their business travel businesses back. So, the countervailing issues, and I think they will continue to pressure people to find ways to make it happen, but, clearly, we're not done seeing pockets of issues with COVID and reactions from local or national governments to that issue. So, I think that's why I say there's a variety of unknowns out there and we're just playing it out and trying not to end up upside down over-marketing to a market that ends up with a problem. So that's one part of it. And then on the Vrbo integration, I would say it's worth it, it continues, it's not where we want it to be, we have more content on that and actually on hotels.com, but the end-to-end process, customer experience is not where we wanted to be. So, we are iterating on that as we continue to make progress towards unifying our tech staff up for our lodging business. It's a core part of that process.

EXPE,Q2,2021,"Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have 2 on ADRs. They're up 21% This quarter year-on-year, I believe 22 versus 2019 levels. So, any further breakdown you can provide in terms of this growth, whether it's a deal mix, organic rate increases, or shifts Vrbo? And how sustainable do you think this is part of the back half of the year?","Peter, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. And I think the 3 categories that you've laid out, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. So, it is a geo mix and into the -- into the U.S., it's a mix into Vrbo, which typically has higher ADR s as well. And then we're seeing for core ADR s increased in some products more than others. So, it gets more color there. On the Vrbo and car side, I would say in particular, have seen meaningful increases in their ADRs, whereas Air has started to recover, but clearly not to the extent of those other 2 and would say the same for conventional lodging, it's sort of somewhere in between that's a higher than Air, but not to the . Projecting forward, we are, as I mentioned earlier on the Vrbo side, for instance, continued to see bookings with those long booking windows. And if you end up with any kind of supply compression and the word that that's what customers are comfortable traveling with and again, as I mentioned earlier, I think people have really enjoyed that product experience. You can continue to expect a -- very possible to expect that you would see that in Vrbo going forward. On the car side, which may get a supply issue. I think that's been discussed in various forms before, and that's going to take some time to work through. But how much demand remains for far as we get out of the summer season is a bit TBD. And as generally presuming that July is a bit of an anomaly if things start to recover again, I think you'll continue to see our ADR increases or are in healthy levels, if you will, going forward. So again, not going to get into specifics of trying to predict where exactly those are going to land. But it gives you a sense of the trends that we're seeing across the different products.

BMY,Q1,2020,"Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe this is for Chris, you obviously have a number of upcoming launches and just wondering how you're adapting the commercial strategy here with the possibility of the current environment persists longer than maybe we'd expect. And are you confident that you can achieve your target sales goals for a lot of these new product launches? And then follow up questions just on liso-cel BLA submission. I was wondering if you can give any more specifics about the FDA request. Thank you.","Sure. Thanks Chris. I mean I'll just say a couple of things. One, we're very excited about the opportunity to launch four first-in-class or best-in-class medicines in the U.S. just this year. And so the launch preparations are going very, very well with the team. Of course we'll continue to use our deep relationships with hematology experts and hematologists and also our commercial infrastructure. So between Reblozyl, liso-cel, ide-cel CC-486 that's the potential for four launches in the U.S, this year. And just to give you some flavor what Chris was saying, we were able to very quickly with Reblozyl pivot for the MDS launch from an in-live situation, which we filled at the beginning of the year to a virtual launch and we continue to have good success stories about the ability to access our physicians and customers in general through virtual engagement. So, we're very excited about the launches ahead of us. And as Chris said, we've really pivoted to that digital environment. I'm finding we're gaining good access.

As it relates to liso-cel, as you know, that we had submitted the application with comprehensive data sets at the end of last year. And the FDA accepted the application for liso-cel and granted a priority review in February of this year. Now, it is typical for the FDA to request additional information as they continue their review process and ask to the company supplied information in response to several requests that the FDA has made. FDA has decided that the information they have received constitute a major amendment. And that's why the PDUFA date has been extended by three months to the 16th of November now. We're obviously committed to ensuring this medicine is available to patients as soon as possible and we continue to meet our severe milestones. Obviously, we're not going to comment on the specifics of our regulatory discussions. But let me just remind that we remain very confident about the data for licensed health for these patients with large B-cell lymphoma, as it is an unmet medical need and we're truly looking forward to the approval of this therapy towards the end of the year.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And so we have taken the position to really maximize early on our remote capabilities in terms of engaging with our customers in order to respect to the challenges of the pandemic. Having said that, while we have global principles, those principles apply differently to different parts of the world. And they also apply to different brands, because the launch of a new indication for an existing well-established brands is clearly a different strategy versus a totally new medicine.

I was wondering if you can give any more specifics about the FDA request. Thank you.","Yes, so maybe I’ll start. Terence, thanks for the question. So as Giovanni mentioned, we made the decision a number of weeks ago to pull in-person engagement with customers. That said, we have continued both on the medical and commercial side to engage with customers remotely. The good news is that BMS has made significant investments in remote engagement capabilities over the last few years. So the teams have a lot of experience, not just for the last couple of months, but for many years in leveraging this technology to engage with customers. And as Giovanni mentioned, we've very much taken the point of view that every launch is going to be viewed as independently. And we'll look at how we're going to engage with customers and how we're going to think about those launches, given the specifics. So for example, you'll recall that when Zeposia was approved in late March, we decided to postpone that launch. We did so because at the time the healthcare system was really just bracing for the impact of COVID. And within the MS community specifically, we were starting to see a pretty big impact on their ability to operate through March. For example, we saw about a 25% decrease in new to brand scripts in MS. And we frankly didn't feel that the conditions were appropriate to introduce a new medicine, without having our commercial and medical teams be able to effectively engage with customers. That said, in recent weeks we've begun to see the MS market begin to adapt to the current environment. Importantly, physicians are beginning to actively initiate new therapies. They began switching patients on therapy and as a result we plan to launch Zeposia, on June 1st. In terms of preparations, the teams are very well prepared. We've hired a very experienced medical and commercial team that's been fully in place frankly before launch. And we've gotten very good feedback on the Zeposia profile. So we're very excited about making that opportunity available. Obviously initially that launch will heavily index and this will be true for first line lung cancer as well it will heavily index on remote engagements. Again, we have a lot of experience in leveraging that technology. And then as conditions warrant, we'll be able to dial-up in personal promotion. And ultimately as we always do, we'll use a mix of both in-person and remote engagement to support those launches. And we have a lot of confidence in the teams across the commercial organization in our ability to execute these launches. Nadim, anything to add.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
VSH,Q3,2011,"Great. Thanks for taking time to answering questions. I don’t think your results and guidance are all that different from your comparable companies. So my question is more about what things look like as we come out of this? They look less cycle coming 2008 maybe a little bit different drivers but you had two quarters there where you grew 15 or I guess it’s 14% sequentially in 3Q and then 15% sequential the following quarter which does not necessarily square with your seasonality in those periods. So, as we come out of this, do you think the recovery would take place fairly dramatically like it did last time? Meaning is this is just mostly inventory correction but looking at distribution it seems like that could be the factor, and if it is going to be that dramatic, again, is it more related just to returning to in-demand versus any real seasonal impact probably?","I maybe an old man but I have no crystal ball. Let me say the following, I suspect that this time it’s heavily inventory-driven this time. Last time we know what has happened but this time, it appears to be more likely that’s inventory-driven which means in deed as you said that there’s no inventory that last forever. That means there should be a recovery, a relatively quick recovery, relative if I’m right.

We have some heavy equipment business. I think some of the COVID products could increase even further from a demand standpoint. Certainly, I think it bodes well for semi-cap as well too.

And are you really seeing that in Q2 or do you still have to actually win more projects to get to that rate?","Jon, that's a great question too. So, all of our sectors, whether it's federal, public, commercial or U.S. Federal, all have a blend of long-term work and short-term work. And if you go to the investor relations snapshot that we show, you can see - again, I would suggest the non-GAAP, because it's the cleanest. But if you go over there, you'll see that of our total revenues 73% are what we call recurring, 15% are nonrecurring services and 12% are technology, which is really - at this point, the vast majority of that is software licensing. But that 15% nonrecurring is really short-term project. And that short-term project work appears throughout our business, including U.S. Federal. So it'd be wrong to say we have all of that locked and signed, because we do expect and rely on that level of project work. But based on what we've already seen, we would not have given out that mid to upper teens numbers if we didn't have confidence in it. The real fly in that ointment would be if there's some kind of a government shutdown toward the end of the year or whether there are issues with respect to the federal budget. That's not foreseen and it's not in our estimate. But other than that, we feel good about that range of revenue in U.S. Federal. And again, that is all organic.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
BMY,Q1,2020,"Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. The first one, in light of the 9ER study, can you talk about the RCC market and the opportunity you see for Opdivo Yervoy versus IO TKI combinations over time? And how you see Bristol positioning these two different frontline offerings they're going to have as you think about how you're going to position them relative to one another? My second question was on COVID and drug pricing. I think you mentioned some of these kind of macroeconomic factors, but when you think about high unemployment as well as growing budget deficits from government payers. How do you see that flowing through as you think about net pricing, looking out later this year and into 2021? Core of the question do you think it's likely that we're going to see some sort of incremental impact to pricing from what's occurring with COVID right now? Thank you so much.","Thank you, Chris. Let me start. I'll give you my perspective on pricing. And then I'll ask Chris to comment on, 9ER and RCC. It's exciting there. So first of all, I think a lot of, first of all, I would say Chris, the issue of drug pricing is one, where we've been in dialogue now for a period of time. And we, as an industry and as a company continue to think that there is a real need to be strategic. And think about reforming some of the elements of the pricing system in the U.S. that are creating affordability issues for patients. As you know, we believe there is a real opportunity through rebate reform and other measures that are market based to address the issue of drug pricing in terms of patient affordability, which is the real issue. Now, with respect to your question, first it is early days and it is early to say, and it is difficult to speculate on the future. Of course the focus of many and I think that was at the center of your question is, what happens in an environment where unemployment is higher and a significant impact to the commercial markets. So one way to think about, if you look at our business, where 60% of our business approximately in the U.S. So of that 60%, about 25% of our business is in the commercial space. And when you look at the dynamics that may play out in the commercial space. I think a lot depends on what happens to patients that may be unemployed and potentially lose coverage. So some of those patients will move to a spouse's insurance plan. Some of those patients may take up COBRA. And obviously any strategy or policy that makes that more affordable would be - even more affordable would be beneficial for patients. Some of those patients will be eligible for Medicare if they're over 65. There may be some shifts to government programs like the exchanges or Medicaid and hopefully no patient or very few patients is covered. So these are all of the dynamics that we're going to be working through. And of course a lot depends on the shape of the recovery and how long unemployment lasts. But I think these are sort of the macro factors that we'll be looking at together. So with that, I'll ask Chris to give you his perspective about the RCC market and the excitement with 9ER.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Thank you so much.","Yeah, thanks for the question Chris. We're very excited about the data that we saw with 9ER. Maybe in answering your question, I'll start with just kind of an update on where we are with Opdivo plus Yervoy today in first line renal. If you go back a year, one of the things that we said when we first started to see the IO TKI data was that we anticipated that Opdivo plus Yervoy would remain a standard-of-care in first line. And that's precisely what's happened. And we think that's been driven primarily by the impressive long-term benefits that you have seen with Opdivo plus Yervoy. We just saw the 42 month OS update at ASCO GU, that OS was about 56% in the ITT population. And that's sort of been continued strong performance of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line. Market share right now is between 30% and 35% overall. It's on the upper end of that range, when you look at the labeled indication that we have in intermediate core. We do get some non-promoted use in the favorable population, which is off label for us of about 15% Opdivo plus Yervoy use there. And we've also seen, that the majority of the use that existing IO plus TKI therapies have gotten in first line renal has largely been at the expense of TKI monotherapy. So Opdivo plus Yervoy has held up really well and in fact we've seen a bit of an uptick in Opdivo plus Yervoy over the last number of months. 9ER very exciting data, we're very happy to see both the OS and the PFS data that we saw there, also very encouraged by the safety profile for 9ER. In terms of how we're thinking about positioning it, still very early days and we're working through the data, but we think these data compete very well against the existing IO TKI therapies. As a result, we think there's an opportunity to drive share from existing IO TKI therapies. We also think that there's an opportunity to drive share from TKI monotherapy in spite of advances in first line renal TKI monotherapy is still about 20% to 25% of share, mostly in the favorable population. And with respect to favorable, we think there's an opportunity there for us as well since 9ER crossroads status and included that favorable population patient and now once approved, we'll have access to that population promotionally. Importantly, the last thing I would say is that once approved 9ER really does give us the opportunity to offer patients multiple IO modalities. We'll be the only company, frankly, to have dual IO, but also what we believe would be a best in class IO TKI offering. So very excited about the opportunity that 9ER offers us to help patients and provide another modality to those patients. And I think that there's a nice opportunity.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then one of the things that we are seeing is that they're continuing to be longer booking windows associated with Vrbo. And as we project forward into Q3 and beyond with those longer booking windows. Our hypothesis is, is that people have been exposed to the category and the category experience.

So, people are going in and reserving the house that they want for whether it's the holiday season or even in into next year as well.

BMY,Q1,2021,"Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions here. Maybe first, just maybe elaborate a little bit more in terms of LAG-3 and its role in the market.

So are these big 2021 events? Or is it just going to take a couple of years to really see the opportunity for those indications? Thanks so much.
","Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. So let me start with LAG-3. So first, let me say that we are very excited and pleased with the data readout that we've seen for the third I-O that we have from BMS. The results are very encouraging.
And I think seeing an enhanced activity on top of Opdivo in melanoma, that's a pretty high bar. And so we're excited about the opportunity to bring this to patients. In terms of where it fits, you remember the current landscape of first-line melanoma, Opdivo-Yervoy represents about 35% to 40% of first-line melanoma. Approximately 30% of this market is still single-agent I-O, and you've got another 30% that is non-I-O.
So we think there's a real clear opportunity here for us to drive the benefit of relatlimab plus OPDIVO into that population. There's clearly a continued unmet need with physicians looking for additional options that have a dual I-O-like effect, and we're looking forward to bringing that combination to patients as we work our way through the regulatory process. In terms of the adjuvant opportunities, again, this is going to be an important opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year. And certainly, as we look about -- look for the growth opportunities beyond 2021, you noted esophageal and the upcoming opportunity with bladder.
We're very excited about those. With adjuvant esophageal, this is a substantial patient population with considerable unmet need. The treatment rates here are relatively low today, just given the lack of approved therapy. So we would anticipate that over time, we'll be able to drive utilization, both in terms of the patients who are being treated today, which is relatively small, and then, improve treatment rates over time, much the way we did, you'll recall, in adjuvant melanoma.
And we would expect a similar dynamic to play out as we launch in bladder cancer as well. And so very excited about those opportunities and look forward to seeing those launches play out in the coming months.

Can I just explore the wireline capex component? It's down about $500 million from the first quarter, and yet I hear you're doing 50 fiber cities. Can you talk, Matt, maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that capex ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then, I guess, what does that mean for, what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter-wave spectrum. We do have an auction coming out in November. You guys have a lot of spectrums here.
Can you comment on interest, that that might be part of your focus come the fall?
","Thanks, Jennifer. So on the capex side. Certainly, as you look between first and second quarter, you've got timing in there. But as we build out fiber and as you say we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint we were deploying fiber today, you'll see a blurring of the line of the capex between the segments.
Obviously, that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment, but the largest customer from that build is the wireless piece of the business. So this is part of densifying the network, prepositioning the network to not just excel in 4G, but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of that spend. But the total capex number, as I said earlier, you should see consistency there.
And as you -- what you're seeing is the continued evolution of our capex from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber build-out is a key component of that. So you should expect to see the continuation of those trends, and it's part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G, and we're excited about that as we go forward.

Can I just explore the wireline capex component? It's down about $500 million from the first quarter, and yet I hear you're doing 50 fiber cities. Can you talk, Matt, maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that capex ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then, I guess, what does that mean for, what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter-wave spectrum. We do have an auction coming out in November. You guys have a lot of spectrums here.
Can you comment on interest, that that might be part of your focus come the fall?
","Yes. When we think about data usage over network, we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need. First of all, we have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum. I think that the last round of spectrum we decided to densify, and I think that is now paying out very well for us.
Secondly, looking to new type of technology and features coming out in a network that can optimize everything from carrier aggregation etc. And lastly, we are, of course, looking to what spectrum we need to have. That is putting us in a very disciplined way how we use these three type of assets, where we decide what to do in order to have the best return on investment. Of course, we're looking into any auction that is coming up and see how that fits in, in that pattern of decision making with these different types of options.
So we will look into that, however, we are also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeter wave right now. But again, we will look into it, if there are any holes we need to fill in this process. But again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification looking into new features of the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed, and then we have the disciplined approach to our return on investment.

Thanks a lot.","I would say that other businesses fell pretty much closer in line in apparel.

ANET,Q1,2020,Great. Thanks. I asked about the service provider segment in somewhat of a laggard. And are there any kind of new strategies or products that you guys are rolling out? Or is there a different sales motion that you think going to invigorate that segment? Thank you.,"Yes. No, thank you for that. We have been marching towards more and more product capability. In fact, we just introduced EOS software release 4.20.4, very targeted towards cloud grade routing and service provider paring use cases with a single EVPN control plane and segment routing and MPLs on the data plane, just a chalk full of features, BGP, flow aware, transport label, NPLS, segment routing, traffic engineering.What I can tell you is we're getting richer and richer in our product capability. But what I can also tell you is service providers take time to operationalize these things in their network. We are doing okay in our already existing service provider customers, and we are starting to win some small Tier 2 and Tier 3 ones, small ones, but too early to call and too early to say much more about it.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
SYKE,Q1,2015,"Great. Thanks. I wondered if you can give us a sense, Chuck, is any telco demand a function of the new iPhone 6 and EMV impacting called into the call center offers? Maybe just any other trends beyond just the seasonality or just projection of volume? Anything bigger driving those trends?","Yes. Kevin, there isn't an answer I can give you that I would say is a possible relationship. Certainly we are seeing advances in self-serve technologies and all but at the same time, we are seeing dramatic increases in the sheer quantity of interactions. So if you didn't self-serve capabilities, you would probably be real trouble trying to serve your clients. I think we all can intuitively understand that in our lives 10 years ago we had 1.7 devices per household Today it's 2.7 and it's continuing to grow.

So the sheer quantity of interactions to anticipating to increase. And with that I think you are going to see advances in self-serve. The hard thing is, what's the impact on voice. And that's not a direct correlation. The things we do see more correlation on and I think this is somewhat intuitive. already of the billing changes, the intensity of the competition, that is a very, very direct strong correlation to our volumes. But the other thing, it's just a newness of new devices.

When the first iPhone came out that was a very big paradigm shift. All of us who had consumers that get used to it. And then with hen that all of the changes in the billing plans. And billing has moved as we all know from voice to data. That too has been a learning curve for consumers. And even though every time I do technology, a new device comes it, it does increase volume. I don't think this is as much of a learning curve for us a consumers anymore.

And I think we are getting more popular with the way the billing plans are set up too. So those are the things that we think are probably more fundamentally causing our clients to have to really fine tune their volume forecast. There is still big volume. It's still a lot of volume. It's a lot of people. And again, those things could end up changing. But that I think is what we are building into the formulas more.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
ANET,Q1,2020,"Great. Thanks. Maybe just one for me. You noted kind of strong behavior out of some of the Tier 2 clouds. But has there been any change and thought? Or is it just too early as the Tier 2s go forward, whether they will continue to kind of build their own data centers or leverage the public cloud more? Do you expect kind of the -to have any change to that behavior? Thanks.","Meta, that's a good question. And I said before, it depends on the Tier 2. We know some of the larger Tier 2s have paused, and it's not that they're going to the public cloud, but they're just pausing their spending. Others are expanding their data centers and some of the smaller ones are continuing for their specialized applications. So it's my belief that they will continue to succeed in their special use cases and complement the public cloud, but it will be cyclical.They didn't do much of it last year and I think some of them are coming back this year. And what we are seeing is the specialty clouds are realizing that some of the workload, they can control better and some belong in the public cloud. So I don't -- I think they'll continue to have a place.And in fact, a good example of that was content delivery network guide. We saw improved traction with the CD customers, and there's some real real-time streaming and content delivery, particularly with work from home with the millions of users and the aggregates of 4K and 8K flows, you can see why they would make some important investments there.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0

And we expect FX to be roughly a five point impact on revenue this year. And so you could see roughly speaking we have got, 1.3% in total, we are looking at 7.7% growth in new business. So this is margin. The suboptimal business is 2% and FX is 5% and our overall net growth in constant currency is going to be 1.3%.

ENTR,Q4,2009,"Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then just one another question around the comments that you made on the CSS technology, HDTV and then the fact that you have demonstrated compatibility between obviously your CSS solution and your MoCA solution, is that something that you think ends up being a hurdle for other eventual MoCA competitors or maybe is a better way think about that perhaps thinking that it's just another step being qualified, and that gives you some extra insurance I guess in the near term HDTV, any details on what your – what you can say there?","Yes. I mean, that is a really long-term barrier to entry to other MoCA suppliers. I think other MoCA suppliers will eventually be able to support portions of the DIRECTV deployment. Historically, at least, when DIRECTV launched a new set-top box platform, that platform stays around for a while. So, it's more of one when (inaudible) in the next landing zone from a design cycle is. So, I think we have got a good runway in front of us, well in basically every set-top box that has MoCA in it at DIRECTV for quite a while, although we are not starting a fight for kind of the next generation. So I don't really see it as a long-term barrier to entry. But the thing that is kind of interesting about us that kind of make your question when we think about this, is that there are opportunities outside of DIRECTV in the international markets where they are starting to move towards single wire technologies using CSS. And as those markets start to move towards multi-room DVR and HDTV, the MoCA-CSS combo has significant benefits in those other geographies. So kind of the system works that we have done allows us to fan out to additional opportunities over time. And the other thing that counts as a benefit there is all of the major set-top box manufacturers that support the DIRECTV deployment now have products that they can then start to socialize with other international satellite service providers using MoCA. So you get some leverage off of the tier one design into some of the other opportunities internationally. So I think all those things end up being pretty positive for both our CSS business and our MoCA business longer-term.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"Great. That's very helpful detail. Just a question on the margin outlook for the 100 basis points to 200 basis points expansion, how should we think about that from a gross versus OpEx leverage standpoint? And specifically on the growth side you've had two strong years of your product margin expansion. Do you expect that strength to continue this year? Thanks very much.","Yes. And let me build on Jack's point. I think - as you asked that it makes me think about probably what is probably not obvious if you're in the outside of this business, because people have seen us reposition products. It tends to take pricing. But I think it's probably not clear that as we evolve this brand and as we continue our climb up the luxury mountain, the product quality is going to continue to move substantially. And the pricing will move with the product naturally. But the value equation will get stronger, not weaker as we get smarter here and we develop better and deeper relationships with our key manufacturing partners. So what might not be clear is as you take the prices up and you get product margin in that equation, you also get leverage throughout the supply chain, right? And so - and that's probably a simple mathematical equation that maybe not everybody is connecting the dots on. But it's relatively simple if you think about it. And if you just kind of try to capture the essence of Bernard Arnault's quote that only in luxury products can you have the ability to make luxury margins. There's a simplicity and a truth to that.

Specifically for us, it would be about sales rather than margin. But I think as Barbara said in her remarks, the indicators that we see support us to think that the fourth quarter will likely be very promotional and so those indicators include the fact that we are seeing plenty of merchandise supply, presumably that supply was made for someone. Secondly, when we look at Q3 results that have been reported so far, they look relatively weak across the retail sector. And then, thirdly, as Barbara said in her remarks, the political and economic environment looks uncertain.

TTE,Q4,2021,"Hello, thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, again, for the results and also for having the vision to grow your LNG portfolio back in 2018, '19, especially with the acquisition of U.S. LNG portfolio from Engie and Toshiba, at a time where those LNG contracts would have probably provided some losses. So I guess that was a countercyclical and wise strategy, in my view. But now I want to understand more your sensitivity to spot LNG prices. And I fully get that given the structure of your portfolio. You may have surely hedges in place. For 2022, if I understood well, during the presentation, you stated that a $10 per MBtu move equals to around $3 billion of additional cash flow, $2.2 billion for Upstream and $0.8 billion for LNG. And back in September, I reminded that you also highlighted that a $10 per MBtu move in both NBP and spot LNG, were adding $6 billion to your cash flow by 2025. Should I be right to understand the discrepancy of $3 billion between the 2 sensitivities because of the hedges you have? That is my first question.

And the second question is, should I also be right to assume that if you were to raise your medium-term assumption for both NBP and JKM, so spot LNG in Asia by $5 per MBtu. We could also add $3 billion of structural cash flow to your 2025 plan.","Technical questions. So first, yes, you are right on Toshiba just to tell you that today, we are cash positive after '21 without using the $800 million we received, it's a profitable business. So we have received $800 million and we are already making more money. So just thank you for reminding that to everybody. I would say then your point. There is a point, yes. We mentioned in September that when the difference between the JKM and Henry Hub is increasing by $1 per million BTU, then we have extra cash of, if I remember, $600 million. By the way, there is a lag effect there because, yes, it's linked to hedges all that. And so in fact, when you make the hedges the year where you make the hedges because it's a mark-to-market story, you are hedging the year after. So you have the results in the year and you have the cash flow in the year after, if I remember correctly. So you have a discrepancy between the results and the cash.

So in 2022, we'll get the results of the hedges which were implemented in 2021. But remember that the way we hedge is quarter after quarter. So we did a new in first quarter '21. But the last quarter, we should have waited for the long -- end of the year. Now we were not magicians. We would have done it. We would have waited but we don't -- do work like that. We hedge quarter after quarter. So in fact, what we embarked in the hedges which will be delivered in 2022, I would say, is only half a year compared to what you could imagine today, just to explain you that. And what we'll do this year, of course, we have today a spread between JKM and Henry Hub which must be around $15 or $20 per million Btu. This is the decisions that we will engage the hedges we will do in first quarter, for example. You will have some results but the cash will be in '23 which is good. That's good visibility.

So there is where it's not exactly to plan. So in a permanent regime, your assumption for 2025 is right. So $5 million BTU extra spread will give us in a permanent regime, $3 billion extra cash flow in 2025. It's more difficult to do from 1 year to another year because it depends, of course, it's a permanent regime but it means the $5 should be the same during -- the spread should be the same along the -- all the years along all the quarters as we, again, hedge quarter after quarter. I think I've been clear to you -- it took me a little time to understand. So I'm trying to translate all that in a -- and if not, you call Jean-Pierre and Stephane and they will explain you. But fundamentally, yes. The answer is, in '22, we'll receive more cash than '21 from these hedges because in '21, we see the 1 done in 2020, in '22, 2021. But '22 is not a full year, I would say, compared to what could be done '23. So is there something additional to come to us in terms of cash flow.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
TTE,Q4,2021,"Hello, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I think I might have one for each of you. Patrick, maybe you can give us a wider update on the current security situations. As you see it on the ground, you mentioned Yemen just now. I'd be interested in Mozambique and the prospect for bring back staff. And perhaps for you, Jean-Pierre, when we talk about -- and many questions have been asked already. I appreciate that on buybacks and shareholder distributions. What should we use as most appropriate metric that you would consider is an appropriate allocation of capital during these relatively high oil and gas price times to shareholders versus to your balance sheet.","Mozambique, I'll let -- I'll give time to Jean-Pierre, a difficult question. Mozambique, I visited Mozambique very -- 10 days ago. I met with President, Nyusi. And some of my people went into Cabo Delgado, not me at this stage. There have been -- let's be clear, it's a war. You have some terrorists. So it's no more a matter of TotalEnergies to be involved in solving that situation. And we will come back -- we could envisage to come back and to restart the project on the nuance there will be peace. I mean, peaceful situation which means not only having been able to secure security to, I would say, take back the control of the security but also to have population, the civil population back in the villages and with a normal life. That will be the signal. There is no way for and we will not build a plant in a country where we'll be surrounded by soldiers. It does not work like that.

Having said that, there have been some clear improvement on the ground. Since the involvement and the Mozambique arrangement with the SADC, I would say, proof, I mean, yes, consortium of different countries, including Rwanda, they managed to get back the security in some key areas around Palma, where we are -- our project is around MocÃmboa da Praia who knows Mozambique, I become an expert but not -- they do not control today to full Cabo Delgado.

And for me, as long as it's not control security. Why it's important? Because the population will come back only when security will be under control and all that is linked for us. But I mean, I have no idea when we can start the project back. But my view is that the conditions under which we could -- we start the projects might be fulfilled, maybe it will take a year, I don't know. We'll see, we observe. And we are -- what is good, we have the same vision with the authorities of Mozambique of what needs to be achieved. There is no pressure for us to exit out of force majeure. And we have established, I would say -- we have frozen a very fewer contractors. We know that -- when we will say, yes, we can come back, it will take 6 months really to start up again. But again, my priority, it's a matter of sustainability of that and human rights. And so we'll not relaunch the project as long as I see photos from refugee camps around the site. But again, it's not negative. It's still -- it's for me a project and we are monitoring the situation because we think that the authorities of Mozambique are taking the right decisions in terms of security.

So let's observe. The contribution TotalEnergies today and its partners is mainly to contribute to the social life, I would say. We have engaged with NGOs to see if we could -- because all the stability in this part of Mozambique will also come from giving some few jobs, some prosperity share without waiting the gas to be produced but we need clearly to help the local populations to see some, I would say, some shared prosperity from the project before. But by just the agriculture and buying food from these farmers for feeding our teams on the project but we need to act on the ground and to -- it's a condition of the security for me. So that could take time as well. But the gas is there, the project is there, the LNG demand is there. So now it's a question of passions and in order to be able to execute the project.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

I'm just wondering which patients are starting on Zeposia and do you expect that to evolve? And then, on the UC indication, are you anticipating an AdCom? And could you update us on how you're preparing for launch? Thank you.
","Sure. Let me start, and then, I can maybe turn it over to Samit for the AdCom question. So very happy with the performance of Zeposia in MS, particularly as you point out, in light of the COVID environment. This was, as we had talked about last year, a market that was hit by COVID in terms of new patient volume being down.
And obviously, this is a market that we are entering into relatively new for BMS. And so at the end of last year, we spent a considerable amount of time making sure we were engaging with customers in many cases for the first time. And then, so our focus was continuing to do a few things. First, it was making sure that we were selling the profile for this, what we believe and clearly is being demonstrated in the data, No.
1 SP in this market. We've seen very good uptake in terms of written prescriptions here. Obviously, the dynamic pool of MS is relatively small. And we've seen most of the business at this point coming from switch patients, and we're continuing to get an increase in new patients who are coming onboard as well.
So we're very happy with that. And we would expect that to continue to evolve over time. And then, obviously, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, a big focus for us has been making sure that we continue to convert those written scripts into commercial dispense and ensuring a very smooth journey for patients in this market, and we've had a great acceleration there. So excited about what we're seeing so far, and we think we are on a very good trajectory for Zeposia in MS in the U.S.

And when you work to get your centers up and running to 85%, 90% you are pretty dependent on what's happening with that portfolio of clients. So it's suddenly, it's got a downturn. I mean, it does have fits and stats. So even with our capacity utilization, Bill, we would love when we are talking about going to get to 85%, but the perfect scenario is that every country that you are operating is at 85. That is what we try to do but it typically isn't the way it happens. It is usually a little more lumpy, like you might get to 90% in one part, you may be sitting at 65% like we were in the U.S. So that's the characteristic of the business. I think you guys, years ago. U.S. had been lumpy. it continues to the lumpy.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HAE,Q4,2014,"Hey Brian, obviously the American Red Cross tender did not go in the direction that you guys were hoping. Obviously underscores the willingness of competitors out there to be extremely aggressive in price. So I heard everything you said on your whole blood management value proposition but I guess the big question I have is, what concrete things are you guys doing to really prove the value of that, so when you go back to some of these organizations that you can really demonstrate cost savings again in the context of environment where your competitors are willing to be extremely aggressive? Obviously you just mentioned SOLX, but I'm just wondering exactly what you guys are going to do here?","It’s SOLX, but it is everything that we've talked about in terms of the solution. This will be a year where we will select a number of blood centers, we will bring our solutions offerings in total -- the new products we are bringing as well to prove out these solutions. In other words, what does it take to not only collect a unit of blood today. But if you’ve got a transfusion that costs roughly a U.S. hospital about $1,100 per unit, how can a blood center affect, not just the cost of collecting, the $200 collection component if you, roughly the $200 cost of collecting, but how can a blood center affect the overall $1,100 transfusion? And that's the real opportunity – how our blood centers become more relevant in that space, and we’ve got a willing customer who wants to work through that and understand how they can help their customers in that space and become more relevant in blood management. And that’s what we will be doing in fiscal ‘15 for the select number of blood centers with these customers.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Do you expect operating expenses to be skewed to the back half again this year as they have been in previous years?","Yes.

Just quickly follow-up on the gross margin front, sounds like just some headwinds in terms of the manufacturing transition from Eden Prairie, but you know your supply chain as well, it sounds like that exits or it will continue into the September quarter, when do you see that starting to alleviate and how should we think about gross margins as we get into December into calendar 2019, what is the expectations we should get out a little bit.","We are really anticipating a more deliberate pace to it, that it’s not a step level if you will, but that will improve, none of us have probably the crystal ball to say what is going to happen within the supply chain as things rebalance, but history would say that things will rebalance, but we are being I guess very deliberate in having gross margin improve on a more gradual basis than say a step level basis.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

I know you're not breaking out the revenue that way. But your commentary was that you saw a growth across all your categories. I just wondered did that include the legacy networking products that have been in decline? And if you could provide some color on what you're seeing with that product category?,"Thanks David.

WBA,Q4,2019,"Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess so James, I think one of the things that investors are going to struggle with this morning is it looks like if you back out all the puts and takes, the company's guiding to a 4% to 5% core OP growth in fiscal 2020.I guess can you walk through some of the components of that about maybe a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth. And I think particularly reimbursement is going to be a big question in 2020? So I guess from a fundamental perspective is, how are you seeing the business -- kind of what are the building blocks for growth for 2020?","Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage point of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually if you strip out -- these are all the puts and takes, we've laid out on slide 19.So the way I think you should think about this is, we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see flat line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment.And then in the U.S., I think this year the way you should rationalize the U.S. is, this year we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook.And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So, we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy, we saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think, if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. So take out Rite Aid, this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. The way, we thought about reimbursement is we've planned reimbursement slightly higher than the last three-year average, and we expect 2020 to be a continued tough year on reimbursement. And we've planned it relatively conservatively higher than the last three-year average and we're not giving anymore information on that.And then you've seen with the call-up of the cost management program that should give you the confidence that we will have a significant leverage on the cost side to – so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range, before the bonus impact. And know, I'm love to give you a lot of insights here into how we talk through this. So reimbursement a little bit higher than in the past, but a much stronger cost program to give us the confidence to deliver this base case.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
DGII,Q3,2018,"Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Ron, wondering if you could comment, if you're seeing anything out of the ordinary from a pricing standpoint on the product side?","No, we haven't seen anything crazy, there is some always strong competition especially in the side of our business where there is lot of growth and that attracts more competitors, but at the same time there is new and exciting use cases and implementation that people are looking for. In addition to higher and higher take rates of the enterprise software that gets associated with the product, which increases the overall value of the solution for the customer, but also increases the amount of opportunity that we can extract. But other than that because of the supply chain challenges the biggest issues we have quite frankly in more servicing and lead times. Customers have been used to and acclimated to getting product within weeks and because of supply chain challenges that's not always the case. And so we are having to educate customers to get out ahead of their demand and try to get more visibility into their forecast and in some cases get right appeals in place in order to secure their product in their lead times.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
OSUR,Q3,2020,"Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe for the first one, Steve, I want to touch on the collection kit opportunity here, $18 million of revenues in the Q. The Q4 guidance implies a modest step up. And I think when you look at the capacity expansion, the goals that you guys had ramping up kit expansion from $35 million to $80 million. So I'm just curious where are we on the expansion? What is the current capacity? Are you selling every single kit that you're making? What should the normalized revenues be for this part of the business once the capacity ramps up?","Thank you, Vijay. I'll start by first saying, we are very pleased with the performance of our Molecular Solutions business unit. And in particular the COVID-19 products that they're selling three into molecular PCR tests, two products were seeing EUAs as we noted in my prepared remarks.While we're not breaking out revenue specifically, you're right that there is a step-up that's for molecular collection kits for COVID-19 that's embedded in our guidance of $55 million to $60 million for the fourth quarter. By the way that $55 million to $60 million would be a record fourth quarter for us as a company. We are moving ahead with our expansion plans. We are almost to the point of selling everything we can make, which I think makes up -- so I think that as we look into 2021, the expansion that we announced in August will serve us well in terms of providing additional capacity to meet enormous demand in the marketplace.

I'm wondering, if you could just put in buckets of the year-over-year improvement of try and dimensionalize new improvement in mix, the decline from lumber costs relative to pricing, and then your price disappointed that that you highlighted?","Sure, yes, as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time making sure we understand that. From our analysis, we would say more than 50% of is an direct result of both the decline in commodities and the -- in the period as well as compared to prior year, so there's sort of two components. One is last year at this time we were seeing pretty significant headwinds, obviously from the rapid inflation. So with that normalizing there's clearly a normal tail in there. In addition is as we pointed out there was a modest decline during the quarter in the value of commodities. So those components together leading to a little more than half of the total change, probably about 20% to 30% of the remainder of the total changes is attributable to mix and that goes to the investments that we've made and the sort of continued growth and our performance of the value at portion of the business. And the balance is really across the rest of the business, but with a focus on the work that we've done in operational excellence.

I think our products groups, both our storage products, defense, mission-critical products and also our solid-state drive solutions, what we call Viking Technology, I think all three of those have a fair amount of opportunity. And then, I see, as I mentioned earlier, we – unless the whole economy falls off the cliff, I would expect better results – or should I say, improvements from our high technology printed circuit boards and backplanes, and our mechanical systems group.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Is this more to be read into that about perhaps a change in strategy or even an acknowledgement of falling behind?","I think you are probably talking about Broadcom's recent announcement of acquiring Teknovus.Okay. So, I think that just rounds out another portion of products lines that they want to be involved in. Historically, Broadcom didn't have an EPON or 10G-EPON product. They think they developed a GPON product internally, which is used and they are going after basically the Alcatel-Lucent business internationally and also at Verizon with their GPON product. EPON is used in some other international geographies and we are starting some – to see some initial indications from service providers, cable service providers that may want to deploy deep fibre architectures where 10G-EPON could be an important technology. So, it's really kind of (inaudible) for us to some extent move or partner with PMC-Sierra and kind of the EPON and 10G-EPON space really more around our Access business because Verizon using GPON. So, we basically partner with BroadLight for the GPON business in Verizon and they'll partner more with PMC-Sierra for the EPON and 10G-EPON.

GGG,Q1,2015,"Hey, good morning. So revenue growth has been consistently robust in the Americas region. But what do make of the more tepid growth in overseas markets really over the last three years, which appears to have underperformed in the regional economies, especially in light of the conversion opportunity in spray equipment? And is the competitive environment becoming more challenging in those markets?","Okay. So I’m going to hit region by region. Our performance in South America, I think, has been reflective of the underlying economies down there. Brazil, certainly, the last couple of years, has been a major headwind for us. We are making progress in that geography in terms of market penetration with our contractor business building out channel and doing some end-user conversion. Again, it’s a very small number and we have a long ways to go, but I see us making forward progress. In Europe, I believe our business there has outperformed the economy. I mean the Western European economy for several years has had really almost no economic growth. And if you take a look at our performance in the West has been pretty decent. Certainly for the last year or so, the Russia has offset a lot of our performance and sort of masked some good work that we’re doing there. Asia Pacific has been, I’ll say, a sore spot, particularly on the contractor side for us. We certainly are not meeting our own expectations in terms of market conversion. Our contractor sales in Asia Pacific - not in every country, but in Asia Pacific as a region has been disappointing. We have made some changes there. We have made some leadership changes in the contractor business. Those I would say are in their infancy here in terms of trying to see if those can have an impact. We are doing some things on the product side. There definitely is more competition in China at the low end than there were a few years ago, but I think generally speaking we feel that it is more of a Graco execution issue on our contractor business in Asia Pacific and that we need to get our act together.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
UIS,Q1,2019,"Hey, guys, good afternoon, nice to see the Services business momentum. Peter, can you go back to that Brazil you were talking about on ClearPath and that renewal? And how is ClearPath renewals looking in terms of convincing these banks, especially these banks to step up again and maybe a little more color on the thought process of the Brazilian client. And then I have a follow-up.","Sure. Well, as Mike indicated, we think that the ClearPath business as a whole is relatively stable from 2019 compared to 2018. Renewal cycles vary from year to year. And they vary from quarter to quarter, because these are dependent on when they come in. With respect to the Brazilian bank in particular, we did mention that also in the press release, Joe, so you can get the specific name there. It's really a good example of the way we're approaching the business. So that is a bank that historically has used ClearPath Forward as an operating system for some of its applications, but not for all of its applications. And so, what we've done there is in addition to extending and renewing the license there, we're expanding it, because there are applications that can be put on to ClearPath Forward or ClearPath Forward related applications, they weren't taking advantage of. So specifically with respect to loan processing, you got a bevy of things that banks can do with their core processing. And so, we're actually expanding our footprint in that Brazilian bank. That's a little different from, let's say, using Elevate. So most of the ClearPath Forward, what we're talking about in that Brazilian situation is what I call a backend core banking system. The promise of Elevate, which we just announced a major new release this quarter, is really on the frontend. It's that omni-channel, which really faces the customer. And the idea behind the open banking system, which is our omni-channel approach to banking, is at this point banks really want best of breed. And there are a ton of fintechs out there that are really putting in some really interesting innovative ways. There is an article in the paper this morning. I think you saw that fintechs are finally striking at core banks. Well, by using Elevate, we're allowing banks to take advantage of these fintech innovations by actually kind of a plug-and-play approach. So that's kind of the yin and yang if you will of our financial sector, which is strengthening the core banking, the kind of behind the scenes large processing approach, while also being pretty innovative at allowing people to start doing customer facing banking, which Unisys historically has not been engaged.",1.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,1.0
ENTR,Q4,2009,"Hey, guys. Couple of quick questions. Dave, on the gross margin, the guidance range 52.5% to 53.5%, the mix there I am sure is somewhat dependent on that, if you get to the higher end of the range, can you give us a sense of what you are thinking about that at this point? Is it definitively favoring more CSS or is MoCA now also kind of up to where the gross margins are for where CSS is at this point?","Sure. First of all, our long-term gross margin range is 50% to 52%. And we have been on the top end of that and are now exceeding it for several quarters now. So clearly the DBS ODU business which has higher margins in the RF product is contributing in a little bigger way than the other product lines. Going forward, I think it's really going to depend on how fast the ramp on the MoCA side actually happens. We thing we're going to continue to get growth out of DIRECTV as we penetrate further with CSS. But I think the MoCA market in general has a larger stamp, so there is potential there for that part to increase. I think at the end of the day, we're going to be able to hit somewhere in the 50% to 52% range quarter-to-quarter for at the foreseeable future.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021,"Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Brian's restocking comments.

And in fact, I think it should continue to drive e-com and omni sales, and we talked about it being up 70% in the quarter. That's just -- that will reflect a little bit of the mix shift in weak supply of inventory on the margin.
And so you're just seeing us continue to hone the inventories for the channel, continuing to use really good techniques in how we restock our -- and using flex warehouse space for our online and omni retailers and be as efficient as possible while still fulfilling demand.

BMY,Q1,2021,"Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just had a couple of quick ones.
On your new launches, highlighted on Slide 12, what were some of the headwinds you saw for Reblozyl this quarter? I mean, what do you think could be the tipping point for Zeposia and Onureg for the current indications? And then, the second question is with your cell therapy franchise. I know it's early, but just given the proximity of the two launches, are there synergies that you're seeing just with respect to site activation or reimbursement, etc.? Thank you.
","Sure. Thanks for the questions, Geoff. There's a lot there, so let me try to hit on each of these relatively quickly. So Reblozyl, we're very pleased actually with the continued strong execution of the teams.
And what we are hearing on Reblozyl and our expectations for growth this year, and certainly in the long term, remain unchanged. As for the dynamics that we saw in the quarter, sales were relatively flat Q4 into Q1, and there were really two factors underlying this. First, as you will have heard from some of our peers, we have seen new patient volumes down in hematology generally. They were down about 10% to 20% versus pre-COVID levels in the MDS population and so that was one of the factors at play, at least for the quarter.
And we have seen specific to Reblozyl, a bit of a prolonged bolus wash-out period. And to give you some context around that, in Q4, we estimate that bolus patients for Reblozyl often were roughly around 40% of the overall business. In Q1, that has come down to about 20% to 25%, and we would expect those patients to continue to come off therapy over the coming months. Those two dynamics, notwithstanding, we are very encouraged by the continued uptake of new patient starts in this setting and continue to see new trials and an expansion of the prescriber base, which is critically important at this point in the launch.
So continued excitement from our perspective with respect to Reblozyl. Onureg and Zeposia in terms of pivot points, I would say, as we have discussed in MS and as you've seen with some of our peers, it does take time to transition patients from written scripts to commercial dispensation in MS. That said, it was a big focus area as we discussed last year, and we are seeing very nice acceleration for Zeposia in MS. And of course, we have the opportunity in UC coming up with the PDUFA date in a month or so.
And that's, obviously, another important opportunity for Zeposia and very much look forward to bringing this differentiated product and mechanism into IBD. Onureg, we're in the process of creating a market with Onureg, and that launch is going very well. In fact, we saw patient demand volume increase about 50% from Q4 coming into Q1. And I would say in that space, we are very excited with what we're seeing.
Now again, it's a market where we're creating a new treatment paradigm, and that's going to take some time. But all indicators are that the efficacy profile of this data is landing well with customers. And again, the teams are executing well. And then, pivoting to your question on cell therapy, we're very excited about the two cell therapy launches.
Both products have been very well received. Given Breyanzi's got a little bit more data in terms of the launch timing, let me start there. The launch there is going very well. We've had over 50 accounts that have been activated already.
Our highest priority accounts, in fact, were activated within eight weeks of approval. The messaging around the best-in-class profile for Breyanzi is landing well. Physicians are clearly seeing a differentiated safety profile. And in fact, we've already infused -- apheresed and infused patients with Breyanzi and so I would say the execution there has been exceptionally well.
And just quickly on Abecma. Obviously, a bit earlier in the process for Abecma, but we have the advantage of launching that product on top of the infrastructure that we've built with Breyanzi. So we've actually been able to more rapidly activate sites there. We've had 25 centers were activated within 10 days of approval.
The physician feedback has been very positive, and there's a lot of enthusiasm for us bringing the first BCMA-targeted cell therapy into multiple myeloma. So, so far, early days, but the launches seem to be off to a very good start.

On your new launches, highlighted on Slide 12, what were some of the headwinds you saw for Reblozyl this quarter? I mean, what do you think could be the tipping point for Zeposia and Onureg for the current indications? And then, the second question is with your cell therapy franchise. I know it's early, but just given the proximity of the two launches, are there synergies that you're seeing just with respect to site activation or reimbursement, etc.? Thank you.
","Thank you, Geoff. Chris, why don't you go ahead? Let me just give you my perspective. I'm really excited with what's happening on the front of our launch brands. The profile of the medicines that you mentioned is very differentiated.
We have strong labels. And what we are hearing from physicians is exciting in terms of the potential role that these agents will have in the marketplace. Let me just ask Chris to give you more insights into some of the launch dynamics you referenced, Geoff.

AMD,Q4,2019,"Hey, guys. Most of my questions been answered, and it kind of lines up with the model we got here, but I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions. And so, basically, for Q4, it looks like semi-customer is probably down 50% sequentially, or somewhere around that range. Is that -- am I leasing the ballpark? And then, secondly, from a server perspective, I'm not expecting you to give numbers on this, but maybe qualitatively, how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise? And I think that's one of the bigger debates, and I don't expect specifics, but anything you could to help us understand what should be the mix between cloud and enterprise for calendar '20?","Yeah, sure, Mitch. So, look, I think you're right. When you look at the semi-custom business in the fourth quarter, it was a bit softer than originally anticipated. So, we had originally said last quarter that we thought the second half of the year would be down high-30s, and we were actually down, you know, more than that for the second half of the year and for Q4.
And as it relates to mix of cloud versus enterprise for 2020. You know, I mean, it will move around from quarter to quarter, but I think the best guess at this point is, let's call it, roughly even between the two.

VZ,Q2,2018,"Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just two, if I could. One, on 5G, what are you hearing from your larger commercial enterprise customers in terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that could facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year? And then secondly, maybe for Matt, on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet.
How should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of excess capital and tax reform benefits, how do they potentially evolve into '19? Thanks.
","Let me start with the 5G and enterprise. You're right, when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or will have, I think that enterprise is a receiver of many of them when it comes to latency, security, launch throughputs and all of that. We are in constant dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services with them and, of course, we're building the Intelligent Edge Network, and here we have the definition at Edge how we do a specific slice for an enterprise, and that could be private 5G network with low latency or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity.
There are some features, if I be little bit deep on technology, that come out on the next revision of the NR 5G technology, which is on the revision 16, that will be even more important for our enterprise customer. But again, we are building this as we speak and we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together with them new type of services, where you're sort of doing a real-time enterprise based on wireless, which haven't been done before. So I think we are very far on our innovation and exploration in this area, and I see great opportunities in it.

","Yes. I'm Matt. On your question around tax reform and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation. Look, the capital allocation, we've talked about this numerous times, and we're focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders.
We know the dividend is important and we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now. And we've also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. And certainly tax reform helps accelerate our ability to do that. That's our focus for 2018.
You saw a good progress in the first half of the year, not just on the debt pay-down, but also when we say strengthen the balance sheet, we include the -- what we did with the pension contribution as well. So we're making good progress here. Too early to give specific views on 2019. But certainly, as you know, tax reform will help us get to those leverage profiles quick than we would have done otherwise and look forward to updating you on '19 when we get closer to it.

VZ,Q2,2018,"Hey, guys. Thanks again. Lowell, congratulations again. And Hans, congratulations, this should be a lot of fun.
Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the capex side to move toward the lower end of the guide. Are you doing less this year than you expected? Or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.
","Thank you very much. I think this is a great question. Remember, when I came in, we decided together with Matt, Lowell, and the whole management to actually flip the whole network to the sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that: one, we wanted to leave a new type of services based on horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G, and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly.
The second was that we also can be so much more efficient with new technologies and multipurpose equipment. At the same time, we put in the new process for capital efficiency, that Matt and I are sharing. And I think that's what you're seeing right now. We're actually doing much more than before, when it comes to deployment than as we say, hey, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we are preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.
At the same time, we also are making a big shift in the whole spending. I mean, if I look at what we spent in 2017 and the capital or capex and in 2018, it's very different. So we're also making a shift at all time. But this is nothing that we're limiting.
We are more efficient on using our capital. And my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I would say, if you go back a couple of years ago, our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cell.
So we have shift dramatically over the years, and I've only been part of it now for more than one year, but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you see in the figures.

VZ,Q2,2018,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks, again, Lowell, congrats to you and Hans. Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower-tax guide.
Could you talk about the reasons why that is, and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation? And do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about, I think, as we've done, historically, some of the changes in the union contract forthcoming, how should we think about that impact on the cost structure? I know you gave us about a 20% margin in the wireline side for this year. But is that -- did those negotiations give you some window and potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.
","Yes. David, we're -- we're really pleased with the relationship that we built with the union. During the last contract, we get together at the senior level very frequently. We've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both the union leadership and members as well as the company.
So when we decided -- attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of exploration that was a major change in our relationship. And I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections, I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen. We do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing, but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract.
But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers, and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike. And so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.

But is that -- did those negotiations give you some window and potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.
","Yup. Thanks, David. So I'll start with the tax question. So as you look at the first half of the year, the ETR was impacted certainly by tax reform, but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter, but you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year.
So that's why we're guiding toward the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow. I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We did not have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payment, as you know.
Second quarter, we had the first two scheduled payments for the year, and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year, and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year. So expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate. I'll let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.

FOSL,Q1,2018,"Hey, guys. Thanks so much. Just a follow-up on Omar's question. I know that you guys have dramatically changed the launch cadence this year. I guess when will we expect to see products that will ship for the third and fourth quarter? And in terms of thinking about your factory capacity and your ability to meet some of those demands, I guess relative to last year, how would you score kind of your factory availability or your ability to flex kind of close-in demand? Thanks.","Yeah, so timing, it will be about a month earlier than last year so think – see it in broad scale across our formats and channels in August with some early limited-edition launches a couple weeks earlier than that. Same sort of annual significant technology upgrade around that fall timeline is the key there. That should be on an ongoing basis be the cadence that you see. And then we'll be adding brands this year as well. So, you'll see more breadth of our offering to go along with that launch timing. In terms of capacity, we are, I think, going to be in a much better position this year even and better managing supply and demand and then at launch and then also have plenty of capacity to flex up and respond to demand in the back half of the year if we see an even better-than-expected result. So now that we're two to three years in on the supply-chain side, I think we'll just continue to do better.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
AXGN,Q2,2018,"Hey, how are you doing Pete? Karen, I wanted to start with a comment that you made earlier in your prepared remarks about distributor challenges and if you could just elaborate on that a little bit? This was a first quarter in a while where your growth is below 40%. So, -- and I appreciate you reiterating your guidance of greater than 40%. So, clearly you're expecting a reacceleration into 3Q and 4Q to get there. But I'd love to just kind of hear what was kind of one-time in nature or what perhaps cause you to kind of come in below that that 40% threshold this quarter? And where did that stack-up relative to your plan?","Well, there's a couple of things to add here. As you know we had built out our direct team in the first quarter -- end of last year first quarter of this year and some of those reps are still ramping. So, that was part of our projected plan to see in second quarter. Again, we don't give quarterly guidance, but second quarter was still a growth quarter for us with looking at how it typically and historically have play out, expecting stronger performance in the last half of the year. And that is our expectation and in fact, I would say those direct reps are running ahead and more productive than what our historical numbers have been. So, we feel confident in that piece. I think the disruption for us is that in some of our independent agencies in selected territories, not all of the channel, but in some selected territories, we had some distractions that caused their performance to be below our expectations. And so we're addressing those and addressing those -- things including adding some resources to help support them. In some cases, its training and support for that -- the independent agencies. And in other cases, it was dividing out the territories and allowing them to focus perhaps in a small regional area where they have strength, but putting in a direct rep where they -- and splitting that territory where they were not as strong or it was an important area for us to provide ongoing growth.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0

But if I think back to when you guys initially talked about it I think the statement was this was somewhat pulled from your substance of user or risk assessment customers saying ""Hey we've got empty labs and we can do this."" Has that expanded potentially as you're approaching that getting it to market hopefully to additional customers potentially kind of bringing your platform in and your place and going beyond sort of those labs? Or how do we think about the commercial opportunity there?","Yes. Andrew, you've recounted our previous statements correctly. And I think you're also right that we've moved even further beyond that with commercial opportunities. And I think the reason for that is that the use and need for antibody tests has changed since the pandemic first started back in March. And as I said earlier, we are now at a stage where antibody tests are going to be more important than they were in the beginning of the pandemic, particularly with prospects of a vaccine coming into play here. So with that in mind, there's a lot more commercial interest than we started from and we are pursuing that as I said with research-only customers right now in the queue in anticipation of the EUA for the oral fluid antibody ELISA test.

FOSL,Q1,2018,"Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. So, I'll focus on the wearable category as well. Jeff, in the back half of last year, I think you took some inventory reserves on some slow-moving inventory that I think you expected to sell earlier this fiscal year. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of the wearable revenue growth in Q1 was driven by liquidating this carryover inventory versus what the go-forward wearable category growth rate was? And then I think on the last call I think that you had talked about a 20% to 25% wearable growth rate for this year. Is that still the plan or is there any change to that outlook, or how should we think about the growth rate for the year?","I'd tell you the growth rate, probably trending a little bit more towards the top-end of that range. We said 20% to 25% and we're probably about in the middle, but we're probably trending a little bit more towards the top-end of the range from a growth rate overall. From a liquidation standpoint, we are moving through that, let's say, in the first quarter. We didn't have a substantial amount. We were continuing to move through at a pretty good price point overall on it. We're really going to go through more of the liquidation phase as we get into the second quarter and really the third quarter is really our big liquidation. Think about our volume picks up significantly. We're trying to manage the margin realization on that product. We could have moved through more of it through some channels, we took the opportunity to move through it at a more modest pace as we went throughout the first quarter and so we'll continue to sell through it in the second and third quarter.

We've always had a very nice mix of value products with the Tomahawk and Trident family connecting to servers.

But what are you hearing from customers about the role of cloud and hybrid cloud and then Citrix -- the value that Citrix can provide to them? And then, just one follow-up for Arlen.","Yes. Phil, I think the conversations are tracking as we have anticipated. Again, it's becoming more strategic. You're seeing a larger number of large deals, for example, as we get into the back half of the year. They would take on a bent that feels more transformational in nature. People, let's face it, have been operating in this pandemic period for seven months now. They've gone through this period of realizing that hybrid work is actually more productive than the model that they had before. And so people have gone back and they're reassessing what is the new normal need to look like. And so, that has taken on a number of larger projects around transforming all aspects of their business, how they engage with customers, partners, employees, et cetera. And that's where we come in. If you -- to talk about broader kind of transformational things, I was just going through the large transactions over the last quarter, and there's a few that really stood out to me. And one, for example, is one of the world's largest natural resource companies. This is one we're partnering with both Microsoft and Amazon together. This customer is streaming applications out of AWS. They're using elements of multiuser desktops at Microsoft and the entire thing is being managed with Citrix, also managing some on-prem footprint. And what they're really trying to do is just transform the entire employee experience, their real estate footprint, and how they plan to work long-term.

But I tell you there our focus right now is on those emerging businesses, especially, Fire and Document Shredding. But again, we have a team that looks at all opportunities in all of our business lines and we will continue to make acquisitions one that can meet the thresholds with our rate of returns.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Hi guys. Mike, on the gross margin, you mentioned that obviously the rework expense was a big part of that, but could you walk through again the components of the decline? It looks like if the rework is all through the cost of goods, it looks like that's maybe 80 basis points to 90 basis points of the 170 basis points kind of, is that right?",I think 75% of the cost hit gross margin.

OSUR,Q3,2020,Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for you here today. I heard you guys talk in your prepared remarks a little bit about the October EUAs for the two DNA Genotek products. I was hoping you could just go a little bit deeper on that and how that could potentially debottleneck the process to continue to drive the momentum behind this business into the fourth quarter as well as into 2021?,"Yes. So Frank thanks for the question. So, I think these are important breakthroughs for the two products that received EUAs. And so that's our ORAcollect RNA and our OMNIgene Oral products. And it's important because essentially there's a pathway now for subcollection that wasn't available on the market before these products were approved provided that they are used in a product that has also received in EUA for an individual to collect their own saliva specimen. So the use of the product if you will very clearly mimics what we've done for in genomic testing used by companies like 23andMe and others. And so from a technical perspective it was very much in line with our expertise. And so it really does allow a pathway for self-collection for saliva. And I think it's important to recognize how far we've come in molecular testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs to really the breakthrough which is using saliva which allows people to take their own sample and not subject themselves to the discomfort or pain associated with those deep swabs. So that's the breakthrough. And I think that evidence of that we provided through the work of our customers. 30000 students at the University of Kansas tested 64 campuses of the State University of New York using the product. So you see widespread distribution of our product and even into the retail channels that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So that is clearly the breakthrough and that's why we're so excited about the progress and growth in our molecular collections, Molecular Solutions business unit and that will continue into 2021 and beyond.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
CTXS,Q3,2020,"Hi thanks. David and Arlen, wondering how you're thinking about a couple of things into 2022 with that higher growth, I think, than people are expecting. One is around the NetScaler business, and you're talking about some pressure on the hardware side, just wondering how that factors in. And then also on these temporary licenses, sort of what degree of success of conversion are you assuming there? And any other factors we should be thinking about in terms of that 4% number for next year? Thanks.","Okay. And Walter, just put a finer point on what Dave was saying, when you think about the growth rate you're talking about, we think about the conversion of the licenses that you asked about, we're thinking of those as stat. So we obviously are driving towards a longer-term relationship with those customers and migrating those customers to our SaaS solutions, which obviously has its own transition. And then -- and as David mentioned, the networking business, the only thing I'd highlight for you is, and we obviously took this into account when we thought about our growth rate going into '21 is the acceleration of the mix, right? And the acceleration of the mix in networking business this quarter looks a lot like Workspace a couple of years ago, which is it went from 29% to 66%. So we're talking about very significant moves in that business. And obviously, that's all baked into how we thought about our growth trajectory and how we're going to go into '21.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And any other factors we should be thinking about in terms of that 4% number for next year? Thanks.","Yes. Let me take the first part. And then, Arlen, you can talk about the conversion of temporary capacity licenses. So, I mean if you step back and think about how we're looking at really this year but leading into 2021 and beyond, I mean, you've seen that the Workspace is really what's driving the business overall. I mean Workspace is up 16% in total revenue this year. That's more than double what it was last year. In fact, I just saw that IDC's share data came out showing Citrix with an increasing share of a growing market. So, I'm really happy with the performance of the Workspace that we've seen over the last six quarters. I think it really demonstrates the value that customers see in these types of technologies and post-pandemic for everything that we've talked about, why they've got a -- when they've got strategic importance and is higher than where it had been. In terms of networking, there's clearly been a large shift there from the way we're delivering software. You saw a sharp decline in hardware sales year-over-year and that's been offset by a really big decline in subscription and software. So, that's the direction that we're taking the overall portfolio. I don't think that's different than the way we have talked about it from a category standpoint. The category is flat to low grower and what we're doing to transform that to really help customers separate this idea of delivering networking services, security service, Workspace, optimization services and what we can do to use those to power a differentiated and sensible Citrix-integrated Workspace over a long period of time. And so for us, it's kind of playing in the category, but also using them to really augment and create an amazing user experience for our broader Workspace, which is still 80% of the company.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Hi there, can I just talk about the C-store channel specifically. It's obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic, but I imagine that there have been some sequential improvement in there. Could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is recovering?","Absolutely. So as you said, we've continued to see strength in food and mass in dollar as consumers eat more at home. The C-store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter, so we saw the business grow in the low-single-digits in the third quarter, which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends.
It did then slow a little bit, as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school. Our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel and significantly ahead of the category. So we have share gains of about 120 basis points in Q3 in that channel.

DIOD,Q1,2018,"Hi, Dr. Lu. During the earnings call, I think it was in October of last year, Rick was highlighting the potential for Diodes to reach 38% gross margin by the second half of this year. And then it sounded like your outlook for gross margin early this year was more muted to about 36%. Today, your Q2 gross margin guidance is 38%. That's even ahead of last year expectation. And at the time one could contend that the end demand environment was stronger than what you're seeing today. So I know you mentioned Europe and automotive but could you go more into details about the catalyst for gross margin? What makes it better than you saw it earlier this year? Maybe quantify how big Pericom is as a percent of revenue and how sustainable you think this gross margin outlook is into the second half?
","Okay. Tristan, you know I've been emphasizing if we grew the automotive and industrial revenue, automatically the gross margin will be improving better than our expectations. And so you can see the result, automotive, while the market went down, our sequential still go up 7% and year-over-year is at 20s high, 28%. So you can see the effort due to the past design win plus the company increase as I have been mentioning to you several times. This strong growth has enabled us to reach 10% - now 10% of our revenue and we continue to improve the automotive performance. And that is the one key thing to improve the gross margin better than expected. Another one is the industrial. Now this quarter, industrial is 29% of our total revenue. It is an indication of a significant growth in the industrial area for Diodes. While the market kind of slowed down and that's you're seeing through other people's earnings conference calls, industrial is actually slowed down a little bit, but for Diodes, we continue gaining the market share. So if you look at my long-term strategy, I've been talking about I want to improve the industrial and automotive to 40% of our revenue. We already reached to 39% and we'll continue our long-term goal of getting higher and higher automotive, industrial - industrial applications. And this will enable us to continue improve our gross margin. One more thing, due to our Pericom acquisition, our Pericom products result in the frequency control or those kind of the IC products contribute a significant growth, contribute to our margin. If you remember, our Pericom products typically have a 50% GP or higher. And so, if that sector grows very faster, then it again enables us to exceed our gross margin guidance. And if you look at the Pericom product concentrate on the data center, cloud computing and servers and automotive applications, all those is good and big growth effort for us and contribute better than average growth in Diodes' business. So, I'm still very confident we will continue effort to benefit from these three key areas, reaching high GP and change our product mix towards the high GP products. Even if we get some pressure from the low-end commodity type of product and the price pressure is there but due to our effort on the other market segments I mentioned, then our GP still able to continue improving.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Hi, I had a question for you. if I look back at Halloween, I'm curious if you split the season apart and you had given some refresher on this last quarter, sort of the early season part and the trick-or-treat season part. Kind of how each piece performed, if you can give us a little color around that? We have some information from IRI, but I'm curious if you have better information than we have.
And then, I'm also curious as I think about that early part, if that's more indicative of what you expect for the Holiday season, as we move into Christmas and that kind of time where you don't have like a trick-or-treat event, can that early season -- if you start that season early, and particular in stores, be more like what we saw in the early part of Halloween, if that makes sense.","Yeah. So clearly we saw that within the season, the early part of the season performed more strongly, and the later part that's more trick-or-treat focused performed a little bit softer. Now, we had anticipated that. So overall, the season performed exactly in line with our expectations.
As we look at the total season, we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago as was our sell-through up versus a year ago. So during a time of the global pandemic, I think it speaks to the resiliency of the category and the consumers' desire to really hold on to and continue to celebrate the traditions and fun occasions like this in their family lives.
As we look at Holiday, Holiday is -- has some different consumer dynamics than Halloween. And so, we believe it will behave a little differently. I don't think we're going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated we could have coming into Halloween. The category should be quite strong, consumers use the product in different ways. It's much more about family occasions. We aren't as big in gifting, some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard hit. So we expect solid results, given that skew to at-home consumption.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
NWSA,Q2,2011,"Hi, I have two questions. One was just sort of a follow on to Michael question. Could you give me some color Chase on advertising really across the platforms? It sounds like there is strength pretty much on every platform in every market and I was just wondering if you can give us some color going into the March quarter? And then secondly can you talk to us about, just give us your views on TV Everywhere? Do you think it’s important for your channels to participate and where are you in deals?","On the advertising markets, it is really strong. I mean seriously TV is leading and I guess I would say National TV in particular. So when you look at the broadcast network and when I touched the scatter the Cable Networks and right now Cable, second half growth looks stronger than the first half growth. And so it is certainly very good. It is good in the station side. The comps get tougher in the station side. So year-on-year we’re not going to have the type of year-on-year growth in the second and the third quarter that we did in the first two. But it's really good solid growth and really across the broadcast platforms ad revenues, I mean across the newspaper be it both Dow Jones, UK, Australia are all up. They are not up like the TV business but it’s double-digit. But they’re, I think that they’re up and it’s getting to look pretty good.

VNRX,Q1,2021,"Hi, I would like to ask you a couple of questions about the NETosis assays. So you have got the one COVID-19 study where you have been collecting these material samples? Have you submitted that data yet for a pre-conference? And if so, which conference, would it be presented at?","Yes. So we have gotten a couple of different paths, we tried to do a big sort of study. And that is been very tough to get off the ground, because everyone quite naturally is concerned with getting their sick well, in the emergency wards. So collecting serial samples and not a complicated trial. But it is obviously something which takes a lot of attention away from, a lot of them have been obviously extremely busy, especially in London in the last few months. So we have been working with, through a few different networks, they have been incredibly good people in the COVID. And so space. I guess the hospitals, we talked about a bit, but very, very large hospitals, the best ones in London and some of the best in the world for COVID work. They have submitted to conferences, I believe the next one, they tend to be two or three months ahead. That is the only problem with when you do it like this. They do it through publication, which is good. I mean, it means they are very happy with the data. And they are very comfortable, but just takes a little more time to conferences don’t happen the next week from when the data comes out. But the next one is July. And we have, as I said a bunch more out there. So I would see a steady stream of them coming through the rest of this year, both in the pig animal model for sepsis therapy and the human model also in sepsis, also in COVID. And I can’t give you the details now. But there is several other areas of NETosis where we have been very active in supporting groups who have research going in that field with providing our assays and our knowledge of NETosis to see how it goes with them. So the first one is, I guess it is been over a month away. And there is a large range of them coming through the year. And I think we have been extremely encouraged with the work that we have been doing with it with our partners who are world renowned specialists in COVID and sepsis and in emergencies. And we are also attempting to now get the size we needed for studies, which can then become the regulatory work for CE mark, which again, at the studies is the delay, once we have that a CE mark can actually happen quite quickly because our platform is so well developed. It is a matter of small number of months once we have the population at run. And as I discussed with Kyle, particularly with sepsis, you can get large numbers very quickly, summer, winter, rain or shine, there is always sepsis in a hospital. So I couldn’t be more happy or excited with the way it is going our platform. We have been shipping kits to very busy, very independent people. And the feedback we have got has been nothing short of excellent in every case, not only in the quality of our assay, but how well it is at doing different things with regard to the NETosis. And as I said, not just the diagnostic, but also potentially, as a companion diagnostic or even patient selection for treatments for clearing out of nets. So potentially a really, really big market and something we are very excited about. And there will be a lot of data through the year. Does that answer your question Bruce?",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SANM,Q4,2012,"Hi, Jure. Hey, Bob, maybe talk a little bit more about the source of the gross margin upside in the quarter. Revenue is at the low end of the range, but gross margin was up 60 basis points and almost a 40% incremental margin. Looks like the components revenue was only up about 5% sequentially. So just talk about how much of the gross margin expansion came from components, improving profitability versus the core business, and maybe some mix factors that drove it.","Yeah. Okay. And thanks, Brian. So first of all, I’d go back to Q3 and say that was the biggest anomaly. If you look at this year, our overall gross margin’s been in the 7.3% to 7.4% range other than Q3. And you’ll recall, in Q3 we got hit by some FX issues as well as a particularly bad mix of business in the third quarter. So, part of your question is comparing to a fairly weak base period. Now, with respect to your question on components, the way we’ve historically defined components, the gross profit was definitely up and was pretty good – not as good as it was in the second half of last year, but starting to recover. Revenue, again in the historical definition, was up as well, and in our new definition as well with the Components, Products & Services. So I think, as Jure I think mentioned, mix was positive, and we’re comparing, particularly with Q3, to a weak base period.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
GGG,Q1,2015,"Hi, Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about operating leverage. And I guess for the rest of the year, all in with the three segments, where are you envisioning the businesses for operating leverage?","I'll take you on a little bit of a journey. Long term, we've always guided to about 40% operating leverage. That's, of course, predicated on a couple things. Stronger organic growth than when we've been reporting. You know, high single digits versus middle or low single digits. Organic growth and it also reflects a mix that's more geographically equal. So this quarter, we had a lot of growth in North America and negative in Asia and flattish in EMEA. That hurts our incremental profitability. So again, when the world gets back to equilibrium and our new product performance is getting us to, I'll call it the 8% to 10% organic growth, and it’s coming around the world, we believe the 40% is still appropriate. For sure this year, short term, we have the issue around exchange and we have the fact that we're not growing quite as rapidly - or lack of growth would probably be a better term - in Asia Pacific and EMEA. So near term, we're going to be significantly less than that 40%.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
DIOD,Q1,2018,"Hi, again. Can you talk a little bit about the TI fab acquisition? What is associated with that within your guidance? And then any details you might be able to provide on the expected accretion or impact to margin or OpEx would be helpful. And then also having to do with the acquisition, how does the fab affect your CapEx profile? Thank you.","Okay. The TI acquisition, one of the elements is we will provide TI with a wafer supply agreement, but it's immaterial or is not material. So, it's not big compared with our Diodes' revenue. Okay? Second, we keep emphasizing it's accretive, even their margin is not as high as our average, but it's accretive to our business. And we're going to use and we are, like I mentioned, we are aggressive now to qualify our own process because we want to use it to support our future growth. Okay? So we are kind of pretty tight on our wafer supply and we have a lot of wafer need to outside and control by other foundry business, foundry people. So what we want to do is increase, again our own supply. So it's helping us in the future for the growth. I think the equipment is already there. We may be missing here and there for some of the equipment needed for our process. Okay? But the most of the equipment is already there. So, with the GFAB and therefore is still within our CapEx model of 5% to 9% of our revenue. So, it won't increase our CapEx requirement.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
UHS,Q2,2012,"Hi, everybody, just maybe I’ll ask two questions as well. Following up on the behavioral business, can you point to is the moderation, I mean albeit you have great margins, is it basically a capital constraint issue in the second quarter that somehow gets a little better in the back half of the year, how much of it was that or how much of it is just natural ebb and flow from Q1 to Q2?","A.J., just following on what I was saying to Tom. I think that 50, 60, 70 basis points that I alluded to is exactly what you’re talking about, it’s – we had beds that we had to have out of service for these construction projects. I think our sense is two-fold. Once we are able to get those beds back in service and once the new beds that we’re building or the converted beds that we’re building go back online, we’re very comfortable that the demand is actually there to support the sort of 5%, 5.5% growth rate.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Hi, everybody, thanks for the question. I realized that China's a small part of your business, but just curious what you're seeing on the ground there with the China tenders and the volume based procurements there. I think that was supposed to happen at some point here in the next few months and if there was an update on that front?","Hey, Travis, thanks for the question. In terms of the VDP in China, it is something that's ongoing. We don't have any major updates at this point is we're waiting on feedback on the process. I think one thing to note, that you mentioned is certainly China is a smaller part of our business. And then as we focus on the products that are actually, potentially under the tenders, there's an even smaller component of our business. So just something to keep in mind as we think about the overall impact that could be coming from VDP on our business.

So we expect to hear back something later in the third quarter. And at that point in time, we'll take a look at it. The one thing that we know is just based on the timing we don't expect it to have any significant impacts on our 2021 numbers.

TTE,Q4,2021,"Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. And also, congratulations on this very strong result and seeing the dividend increase as well. Two questions from me. First, just on the project in the Gulf of Mexico that you announced the North Platte deepwater, it's certainly extraordinary in the context of having completed the seed. You've got the semi-submersible production facilities out tender and Valaris has got 42-month drilling contract. So with that in mind, it's not in its infancy. So can you just walk us through the industrial or financial logic as to why you've done that potentially sort of within the context of U.S. energy policy around Gulf of Mexico? Is there sort of -- should we draw conclusions around your appetite to invest within GoM within that context. So just trying to understand, even from a policy standpoint, how you see the U.S. from an investment standpoint?

And then the second question, it relates to the very welcome sort of sustainability and climate progress report. I mean within the framework of how you deliver this these metrics and then the data around carbon intensity, should we or can we hope for more disclosure at the asset level in terms of carbon intensity, asset or region so we can better understand the relationship between profitability, returns and the carbon intensity of some of the highest carbon-intensive projects in the world.","Thank you, Christyan, for these 2 questions. The first one, no, there is no U.S. policy. It's not -- there is no U.S. policy involved. No consideration of the U.S. policy regarding GoM and all in this decision. It's a pure intrinsic decision linked to the project and linked also to our capital allocation. We look at it. It's honestly at the limit -- at the high limit of the range we gave ourselves. I remind you that we set to investors -- we'll invest in all portfolio, in all greenfield projects, $20 per barrel, $30 of technical cost, CapEx plus OpEx or $30 of breakeven. And North Platte because of its size, in fact, we knew it. It's not a giant field. It's not -- it's really on the high side of these metrics. So that's one point.

And second point, we prefer to invest in SÃpia [ph] and Atapu in Brazil than in North Platte. So yes, we have done our job because we are -- we were the operator but -- and we want our partner to be able if they wish to do so to hand over in a smooth way. But all in all, at the end, we consider that we had better opportunities in our portfolio to allocate our capital. So there is no politics behind it, just decision at all level and again, in the framework of investment -- inside our investment framework that I just reminded. I'm not sure we'll report all the assets one by one. We don't report the production one by one. We do it regionally. So I'm considering that. I will take your point. There is no problem for me to be -- to look at it. By the way, we begin. I think if I remember correctly, we have this spread of reporting between the different continents, like we've done for reserves. I think we'll -- at the end of the day, for me, I consider that fundamentally, I don't know what the SEC will issue but we should report on these emissions like on the financials in the same type of framework.

So we are working on it. And by the way, we are also working not only on Scope 1 and 2 operated emissions but only on the equity emissions. I think this year, we'll be able to do it for Scope 1. We don't have all the data for Scope 2 from all our assets but it's progress report, so we progress. And I think -- so we will disclose more in our sustainability and climate report and what we have done until now in a way which is more readable for you so that you can better maybe analyze the data; so that's our intent. The idea for Broad by submitting, by the way, to an advisory vote this report is that to consider that the financial -- the general assembly of shareholders approved the financial reporting that will approve the extra financial reporting and we think this is a global trend. We've seen at COP26, the ISSB and all these organizations willing to normalize, I would say, the extra financial and we are willing to contribute to that.

Christyan, just a word, I read your paper this morning. You are pessimistic about our capacity to make buybacks on the year 2022.

We are in the early innings of starting that process and of removing the inventory from the physical store locations. As we are working through that, we’re mindful not to cannibalize sales during this holiday period.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
BBBY,Q2,2019,"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about some of the strategic review as you analyze some of the different business units and some of the assets that you may be able to sell, like some of the real estate. I guess, is there any ability to quantify for us the kinds of bids or interest level that may be out there and any more ability to talk about timing with which you might be able to address some of this?","Hi, this is Mary. Thanks for the question, Brad. I would say, at this point no, we’re not in a position to put specific numbers to you know the businesses and all that. I will say, we are very actively engaged in the process, and we’ve had a number of inbound interests on some of our portfolio companies, and so we’re taking a look at those, we are evaluating that, we’re going through the normal process that you would go through to do that, and so when we have something to report that actually turns into you know a potential transaction, we’ll certainly come forward with that. But at this point, not knowing you know how many things may go forward and all of that, it’s hard for us to put any number on it.And in terms of the other assets, the real estate, I think we talked about that from a square footage standpoint. You know it’s a combination of retail and non-retail real estate. So we’re looking at some inbounds there as well, and so we’ll have a sense of that, I would say in the next quarter or two as we move through that process.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two robotic questions from me. First, on Mako, I'd love to hear about the OUS rollout, new geographies how that's going places like Japan, I think you're waiting for China, hopefully I don't have those two backwards and just color on the mix, US, OUS of Mako placements? And I had one follow up.","Yes, thanks, Larry. Certainly our OUS business has picked up. As you saw in the pandemic, the U.S. business continued very strong on Mako, but our OUS business did slow down and that's ramping back up again. We are fully operational with both Japan and China on all three applications, same with Brazil, as well as Russia. And so Japan is really starting to accelerate, which we're quite excited about. China has started. We still have, it's a little bit behind Japan. Brazil, we now have our first few sales in Brazil, so that's probably one of the later ones, and Russia as well.

So we're in the early stages in those four markets and the demand is very high from surgeons, which is exciting. Brazil was delayed a little bit by COVID, but we are starting to build momentum there as well. So it's very exciting. The surgeons, it's kind of taking us back to when we launched Mako total knee here in the United States. There's high demand for it and you should expect strong performances in the quarters ahead.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

POP also down slightly quarter-to-quarter, that's based on our guidance. So that's how we look at the inventory level as well, right?

HSY,Q3,2020,"Hi, good morning everyone. So just one question for me and I think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about some inflation in cost of goods sold. So maybe Steve, could you just give us kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of what commodity costs and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently in the context of -- seems like freight costs are going up, you've had some competitors talk about, coco prices going up. So just trying to get an understanding of directionally, where inflation is headed right now.","Sure. Yeah, for us, I'd say overall, it's been relatively stable, so on the commodity side, relatively stable. You saw big movements in commodities across Q2 and Q3 and of course, we've talked in the past, we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program and I would say today they are fairly stable.
There are increases in freight costs. There too, our teams do a great job of longer-term contracting, which helps to mitigate some of that increase, so that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing costs and part of that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen.
So we call that out in the prepared remarks. But in total, sitting at this point, I would say overall COGS is fairly stable and we'll give more guidance on 2021 when we get into the fourth quarter call.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
GGG,Q1,2015,"Hi, good morning guys. Just about the recent acquisitions. Given the continued weakness in the oil and gas sectors, are your expectations for the contributions from these businesses still the same as what they were three months ago?","Yes, probably three months ago. Probably not six months ago. So you know, when we were in the midst of doing the two deals that we did out of the group that have some oil and gas exposure, that was kind of at the point of and just the beginning of the point when oil prices started to collapse. So obviously, our timing wasn't great on those. They are not huge, so it shouldn't be the end of the world. I'll remind you that the high pressure equipment acquisition was only half oil and gas and Alco was about 70% oil and gas.. So those, compared to what we were thinking six months ago, those will probably have some challenges. But I think that our guidance in terms of what we thought the EPS accretion would be for 2015 still looks like it's going to be okay.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
VRTV,Q4,2018,"Hi, good morning. Can you give us some extra flavor on why you are confident the Packaging segment will be able to outgrow GDP in 2019? The only reason I'm asking is you tough compare versus last year's cycling the AAC acquisition and in this first quarter for that you're up basically at GDP levels. That was my first question.","Sure. So our value proposition in Packaging is different than what the manufacturer's value proposition is. And I believe we add more value in general, because we're providing both -- we're substrate agnostic, we provide a total solution and we can -- and that gives us the ability then to target higher growth market segments as well. And so it's a combination of targeting higher growth segments within the Packaging space along with higher specialty products, and we do anticipate that there is going to be some uplift in pricing not to the degree that we had last year, as well as we've been continuing to make investments in this space, recognizing that the growth there has to offset the structural decline in our Print and Publishing business. So it's a combination of investments, it's a combination of our value proposition, the expectation that there will be some price benefit due to both cost of goods sold, as well as our own pricing initiatives and those factors in our minds add up to slightly better than GDP type growth.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0

Did it increase sequentially, the point of sale for the month of October?","I have reliable information this case for a quarter, so I would rather not comment on a month on POS but obviously as quarters have come back to a degree, I would say the POS for sure will not have come down further, I think.

ACAT,Q1,2012,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions here on guidance. Core ATV, you’re assuming flat to down 5% for the year. Obviously, as you mentioned, the fourth – and that’s an industry assumption – obviously, the fourth quarter was up pretty nicely and so it sounds like you’re assuming a pretty meaningful deceleration. Is that just being conservative or does that – are you seeing something so far during the first quarter that would support that?
And then I guess the flip side of that question, in terms of Snowmobiles, flat to up for the industry, I think it’s pretty straightforward what warm weather does to your ship-in patterns, but how does that affect sell-through ultimately, given how warm we finished this past snowmobile season?","All right, James. A lot of questions there. I’ll start to break them down a little bit. On the ATV side, you’re correct. Calendar year, the January, February, March that just completed, there is no doubt that the ATV industry, as I mentioned in my comments, did show some positive results. It’s the first time we’ve seen that for some time.
What I would say is as we continue to talk to dealers, as we look at the overall economy out there, we’ve not seen enough to go ahead and justify, in our opinion, that we have now hit the bottom and that ATVs are going to go ahead and turn around. So I think that the zero to down 5%, based on where it’s been over the last few years, is our best estimate as we sit here today.
On the other side of the equation, or side-by-sides, we do not provide industry data because it’s not put out by the association. But as we mentioned during my comments, we saw double-digit growth during the quarter as well as for the fiscal year last year excluding the Wildcat, and we would expect that to continue into next year or so. I think we’ll see another good year on side-by-sides and I think we’ll see it improve, but although not a great year on the ATV side of the business.
Regarding snowmobiles, our estimate now of zero to plus 2%, primarily driven by I’ll say pent up demand, we didn’t have a lot of snow in a lot of North American markets. We had good snow in certain other parts, Scandinavia, Russia and so forth. But I do think you’ll see those buyers that would have bought in January, February and March come back into the market and we’ll see a positive result of that next year.",0.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
UNVR,Q1,2017,"Hi, good morning. This is Ben on for Steve. In Canada, can you discuss the shift in mix that occurred in the quarter and what your outlook is for margins going forward in that segment?","Okay. Hey, Ben, sure. Yes, there is a very visible shift going on. We had a nice rebound in the energy markets in Western Canada for that that brings to life a lot more demand for methanol and to the natural gas pipeline. And that is compared to the average, it's a lower margin product. So you see the shift in margin there. We also saw demand up in the mining sector in Canada in the first quarter. But we also have more initiatives for growth in place in Eastern of Canada and industrial end markets of Eastern Canada. So it's always to tell those three, and then you've got Ag in the middle of the country that is coming up pretty nicely this year. So our end margin is the result of those three distinct end market zones within Canada.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,1.0,2.0

It would be great if you can talk a little bit about the drivers for growth in recent quarters and the sustainability of growth going forward. Especially on the other side of COVID? That's a fair question.","Yes, absolutely. So we're very pleased with smoke evacuation and what that business does for us, in terms of our ability to grow. As we look at it, we really look at ourselves as market leaders behind our broad portfolio, and it's one of those businesses that actually sits across a couple of different divisions, both within instruments and also within endo, our endo businesses.

Anything you can speak to on that and then what we should kind of look for in margins on PG&A going forward?","Yeah. Mark, this is Tim. In Q4, we had less of the snow- related high-margin products shipped, obviously, with the lower snowfall.

Has anything fundamentally changed in terms of free cash flow conversion? I guess how should I think about that playing out for the rest of the year?","I think you should project as you have, as we have done. We have done a good job in quarter one.

AMD,Q4,2019,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had, first, a question on gross margin, especially in Q1. You said consoles are negligible.
Gross margins are 46%, so that suggests that that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So, does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix? I'm a little surprised it's not higher, given all the new products in aggregate, we're supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50%, and most of the mix today should be new products? So, I guess, how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here? Is it basically just server mix, or is there something else that can help with that? Thank you.
","Let me get started, and Lisa can add. But, you know, Stacy, as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next-generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get, you know, converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint, and that did benefit our margin in the 2019-timeframe.
And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020, it does benefit, and then the margin is 46%. And from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45%, and that's because the semi-custom business, which is lower than corporate average, does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we're expecting 80% of that in the back-half of the year. But by that time, also, the new-generation products and the other businesses, including data center and client reramping all on seven nanometer, and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi-custom business.

","No, that's OK, Stacy. I was just going to add to what Devinder said. So, we don't expect the client notebook mix to fully cut over to the new seven-nanometer products until later in the year. And in terms of, you know, opportunities to improve margins, it is definitely product mix.

EXPE,Q2,2021,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On marketing, on-brand spends specifically, can you talk about what brands and where you're investing? Is this supporting brands that are strengths or are you guys building brands And also, should we think of this as more of a permanent change to your marketing strategy, or has cancelation rates normalized? Are you guys going to shift to spend back to more high quality? Thank you.","Thanks, Andrew. I would say a couple of things. One, yes, we're investing in relative strength. So, for example, Vrbo has been an area of considerably increased investment, during the past several quarters. Other opportunities regionally where we've put money, whether that's in traditional brand spend or social or other things. So regional brands, in some cases, we've seen increases as well. I would say while we are leaning into that and we're leaning into our biggest brands, obviously, in strong markets like the U.S., we believe we can do a lot better in terms of brand messaging, getting cleaner on the brand propositions and, as I mentioned, getting all the brands to work together as a family of brands as opposed to a sort of traditional on most competitors. So, we think there's a lot of opportunities to not just spend on-brand with a bias towards brand-building, but spend that money more efficiently against even stronger, creative, and more efficient ways to build the brand. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities there. And yes, we intend to also grow in new geos as we refine our capabilities there. And pick markets where we are going to go on the offensive. And then I think as far as performance goes, I think what we're talking about when I say we have a bias towards brand building, is we want to build long-term relationships. But brand spends and performance work together. But stronger brands are better performing, your performance marketing is. And as long as performance marketing can return the kind of returns and bring us the kinds of customers, those that are sticky and build long-term value, we will spend into that and we will spend as much as that makes economic sense to do. So, I don't think it's an either-or question. It's a question of right now, having a bias again, towards that brand-building while we see how performance marketing shakes up. But as we get better, we believe we will be able to continue to invest in the performance market and more efficiently than we ever have, and bring the right kinds of customers with the backdrop of brand building that really creates sticky customers for the future. So, I think you'll see us do both. Don't exactly know where the ratios will bear out. We think the Company was over bias towards performance marketing because we just didn't have all the tools, we needed across the brand enterprise. But we think, now, we're in a much different place, so that's where we're going to go. Thank you, Andrew. I think we're at the end. So, I just want to say thank you, everybody.

OSUR,Q3,2020,"Hi, guys. This is Casey on for Tycho. I guess first question I have is – are you guys baking in any COVID antibody revenue into your 4Q guide? And then how do you see the market evolving for this test? I guess how much of an advantage is perhaps using oral fluid how much of a competitive advantage is that?","So Casey, we have not broken out individual products into our guide for $55 million to $60 million. But I think as we announced back in August, once we locked prototype on the antibody test we would begin building inventory that is manufacturing at risk. That has come to fruition. We have customers that are now evaluating our product on a research-use-only basis before we get our EUA. So that's moving along nicely. I think the market for this oral fluid antibody test is going to be expansive. It's coming at a great time when the discussion in the pandemic has moved towards seroprevalence and surveillance. There was an article out just today that said that there's probably 20% of New York City residents that have been exposed to the disease but they haven't been counted or measured yet. So we really do not know the seroprevalence [indiscernible] possibilities for our product in 2021 and 2022. In the rollout of a vaccine this will be a powerful tool to accompany the vaccine to see what – how much of the population are mounting antibodies to this virus overall. So – and we know from our own experience with genomic testing that oral fluid sampling is a lot better than blood-based sampling. And this is the only product if and when it's approved for EUA by the FDA to use an oral fluid. I think there are over 300 antibody tests that use blood. So it – in the tradition of OraSure these are unique products with unique applications.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So as you're well aware, we have an action filed in State Court in Nevada. It's been pending for a little while. We're anticipating that discovery will be ongoing for several more months. After that, there's typically some motions called motions for summary judgment to try and simplify the case. The trial date is currently set for October of 2013 and probably the only caution I would add is the trial dates that far out because it has a tendency to flip sometimes.

NWSA,Q2,2011,"Hi, just couple of questions following on the current technology side. When you look at doing things on the movie side with your content in terms of early release, video on demand or selling your content early in a digital window, wondering kind how your plans are evolving on that front? And then two, when you’re talk about the strength of the RSNs, with the prospect of an NBA strike next year, how do you look at, A, how big of an impact is basketball to the RSNs overall? And is there any plans in terms of other programming that could be shifted around, and just how you’re thinking about that overall would be great? Thanks.","Yeah, on the movie side, I guess early windows specifically electronic distribution I guess more broadly and I think it’s very important for us. I think the early window, its not 30 days, its 60 days I think is an important opportunity for us to create something that isn’t, it is a different experience. I think it’s different than the theatre. Theatrical side is important to us. We need to make sure we protect the strengths of that. But I think that window to get it properly priced and it’s something, I think it’s something you’ll see in short-term and certainly I think the first half of this year you’ll see people moving forward there. I think the broader electronic distribution is equally important. I think we need to make sure, if you ask me the most attractive part of it is we can price our product and looking at, price experience in a way that gets us fair value and I don't think sort of whatever short-term windows that get us a dollar a rental is fair value for our product and these electronic distribution platforms enable us to get there and to put appropriate pricing, fair pricing on our product in various windows. So I think we should be aggressively developing these distribution platforms. RSNs, a strike is always tough to sort of, you don’t know it’s going to last, A, is it going to happen, is it going to last a day, is it going to last a month, is it going to last what have you. So I don’t think it’ll last forever, so you're not making, there are limits down much you could really make plans for something that probably as a realistic outside to it that isn't that long. Basketball's important to us, I think we try to do we could, whether it means next college games or things we could go after and we try to mitigate it, but we’re not in these, so we hope these strikes don't happen. We hope already they reach settlements. But I think as we get some little visibility and predictability at the time, you sort of probably do what you can in the very short term to mitigate, but stuffed up that’s really makes significant plans and given just the nature of the uncertainty around it.",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0

That could be a surprise upside in the second half comes back more forcefully ?","Yes, it does. I mean, basically, it looks at the environment as being more or less what it is today, perhaps even, maybe, call it a little softer than what we’re seeing for the fiscal second quarter, because we saw a lot of drop in upside demand that impacted the second quarter that doesn’t necessarily impact Q3 and Q4 at this point.

So we definitely believe in investing in our brands. That is a critical piece of our growth model on the business.

Is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailer's desire to merchandise confectionery products in those markets?","Yeah. So first of all, I'd start by saying certainly there is a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic. We all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of occasional increases in spikes in markets around the globe. That said, I would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in international. Our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment and I think that we've seen, while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different, consumers are really looking, during this time, for brands they trust and we've done a great job over the past couple of years building the Hershey equity.
So we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets. I think I mentioned in India, our business was now up 6% versus it had been down. We gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category. So I wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis.

We just end the warning but we consider there is somewhere in the $6 billion, it's reported as recurrent results, a $1 billion which has been clearly given by the, I would say, exceptional trading. I remind you that in Q2 2020 our all trading, we made the same warning. So I just to tell you because the base for me is more $5 billion for quarter and $6 billion, $5 billion and $6 billion [ph]. So you can consider -- take it like that. And it's gas and power team which -- because iGRP includes everything. I will not give more detail on that. Yes. Libya. Yes, in Libya, there is in our, I would say, working capital. We had an amount of around $1 billion, a positive...

End of '21, I will be very transparent to you, end of December 2021, there is $1 billion which is in all balance sheet which has been transferred in Libya to the Libya government. Why it was in our balance sheet? Like it was with all the partners is that there was a debate to which institution we should direct the $1 billion. And obviously, we were all very careful together with our colleagues, partners on the Waha field, not to direct that to the wrong institution. We wanted that to be sure that it was a central bank of Libya and the right account, not to be accused of mismanagement. So it took a little time to clarify the paperwork and we received the instruction, a clear and valid instruction in January. So the $1 billion which is in our working capital has disappeared now, end of March, it will not be somewhere there. But there are other good elements by end of March, margin calls and things like that which will compensate working capital. So yes, it's true but it's not a major point.

AAPL,Q2,2009,"Hi, thanks. Peter, for you. Cash flow was actually down year-over-year. It’s the first time going back for some period of time that I’ve seen cash flow from operations to be down on the year-over-year for the March quarter. Could you talk about a little bit of what was driving that and specifically, was there anything on the deferred revenue recognition – the deferred balance that changed consistent with the revenue recognition policies or the like thereof when you went to the new software platform?","Keith, no, there is nothing with what iPhone or deferred revenue or cost from a policy change that played into that. I was actually very pleased with the cash generation in the quarter, was up over $700 million from the end of the December quarter. But there are three things to discuss with you that did play into the cash generation in the quarter. First, as we talked about in the last quarter’s call, we did make our prepayment to LGD for $500 million [ph]. Second, you’d notice that our accounts payable was down from the December to March quarter by over $700 million. The decline in AP as we leave the holiday quarter and conclude the March quarter is very typical for us. So, there is nothing new there, but that does play into the sequential results. The third component to discuss with you is our tax payments. We made about $1.3 billion in tax payments in the March quarter and there is a couple of things that were driving that. First of all, for the current fiscal year, so this year, fiscal ’09, we make our first estimated tax payments in the March quarter for the current fiscal year and in fact, there are two that are due in the quarter. This year, the tax payments were higher than what we saw last year because A, we are making more money, and B, given the equity markets, the credit that the company gets from employee option and RSU gains are down. So, we paid more tax for that and then also, we prepaid some potential audit settlements that were accrued on the balance sheet, but we paid them on a cash basis this quarter for prior years and we trued up for fiscal ’08 this quarter as well. So, all three of those things combine for $1.3 billion in tax payments this quarter and that was up significantly year-over-year.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

","Hey Chris, it’s Keith. Thanks for the questions. So, first, in terms of updates from the judge, no specific update from the judge. I think what we can do though, as we can look at his most recently ruling and his most recent ruling which was in regards to cadence taken about two months in order to issue that ruling. And if you look at historically, the amount of time it has taken them, it has taken them about three months.

That said, it is still quite possible we could issue the decision on or before December 30th to the extent that he doesn’t, then in the past, he has proactively issued in injunction preventing the launch of generics. And for some reason in this case, he did not then we would certainly petition the court for an injunction. So we are still feeling very good about the case. We are confident of the outcome and looking forward to the decision from the judge.

TWI,Q4,2017,Hi. Can you elaborate more on what you experienced with rubber last year? You said that cost went up and you were not able to pass it through in terms of price increases. Maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that and what was the impact?,"Right. We announced in the first quarter of last year is roughly a $10 million hit primarily to our North American tire business due to a sharp increase in natural rubber prices. It was driven primarily by some speculation in the market not driven by a supply constraint issue. For us, we run a higher blend across our total tire portfolio of natural rubber because of the off-road requirements of natural rubber being put into our recipes for our products. So we came out with that in the first quarter last year, probably one of the first public companies to announce an impact of natural rubber on their results. What happened in subsequent quarters after that is that just about every tire manufacturer around the world expressed concerns and took really a hit to their operating margin due to the rising cost of rubber. And so for us that impacted us again in the second quarter roughly $9 million. So the total for 2017 was right around $19 million, $20 million and that was all in the first half of the year. So for us, the back half of the year the impact of imbalance between natural rubber cost and the price that we can pass through our customers, really the impact was mitigated. So it was really just a first half of the year phenomenon. But it continues to be a drain on some tire manufacturers and they continue to talk about just issues with the imbalance between raw material costs and pricing. But for us, Jim and I in Titan have not had that same level of concern over the back half of the year and we have not talked about it in the back half of the year. So as we sit here today going into 2018, we do not have really any further updates other than we’re kind of a rational world right now as far as pricing cost and hopefully it remains that way. And then on the steel side of the business, as I talked about earlier, that’s a different business model for us where we do have better capabilities to pass through the impact of any rising steel cost. So as steel prices have increased at this point, we are not giving any disruption through our cost model.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0

So the merchants are out in market every day, looking for opportunities, so they’ve been able to chase into categories that we are selling.

AMD,Q4,2019,"Hi. Congrats on the strong results, and thanks for taking the question. Lisa, this may overlap a little bit with the next question, but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full-year guidance. For both your PC business, as well as the server business, can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you're making in the market share assumptions for the full year? And then I've got a quick follow-up.
Thank you.
","Sure. Sure. So, let me talk first about the market, and then talk a little bit about how we're seeing the full year. So, if you look at the PC market, I think, the, you know, discussion so far has been, let's call it, 2020, flat to maybe down slightly.
There have been some concerns raised about the second half of '20 perhaps be a weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half. We're viewing it as flat, flattish, maybe down very slightly. That being the case, back to the comment I made with Vivek, I think we feel very good about our product portfolio, and especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share. The strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations, and the platforms are also significantly broader, so we feel good about that.
In the data center market, again, I would say that the growth of computing continues. You know, from our standpoint, we see it as a good market environment for data center in both clouds, as well as enterprise. When we look at our full-year revenue guide of approximately 28 to 30% for the year, the highest growth, you know, from a percentage standpoint will, obviously, be server, just given the expectations in that market. But we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020, and that's just, you know, again, based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins, as well as just overall competitiveness.

Let me ask a strategic question about video, if I could. You discontinued go90 in the quarter. There have at least been press reports about -- at least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath and whether Oath -- addressable advertising might actually be more successful outside the company instead of inside the company? I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing, and now that you've had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising? And then as part of that, if you could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath that would be helpful.
","And I can chime in here. I mean, I've been around now for quite a while both as leading this. But I've been sitting together with Lowell and management team and the board on the strategic decision we've done and I'm fully on-board on all of them. And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them, and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them, both leverage them and also get more synergies about all them.
And you're talking about the Oath, for example, I mean, today, with the massive confidence we have in Oath when it comes to AI, ML, and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization, that's great synergy and creating a lot of new possibilities for us. On the front end, we're constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our sort of the Verizon side and outside, and we will continue to find those ways forward. So I feel good about the assets we have, and I agree with Lowell that we can partner with them. And again we are betting on that we're going to have the best Network Intelligent Edge Network, we're going to have a great 5G, the best.
And of course, we can attract partners that we can work with. And I think that is a model that we have and that we can continue to develop.

","Yes. So let me deal with those in reverse order there, Craig, and then I'll let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath, I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format -- excuse me.
We see the synergies that we expected to see and we see the future that we'd hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks, the integration efforts that are going on, they're on schedule, and so we see no reason to do that and there is no credible report out there that otherwise in my view. So I'll be clear about that. On the video side, look, that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today.
We only expect that to go up over time. We're not fans of linear, but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here. It's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want to make. It's much better in our view to do digital.
So we're, as we've always said, skating to where the puck is going. So that's where we're focused. I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago. Hans went and we met with all of the major content providers, the sports leagues, the healthcare, education, gaming all of those segments and every one of them when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially, the latency, certainly, along with the capacity, but when they see the legacy, their eyes light up about what's possible.
So my view is, and I know Hans shares this, we've developed these strategies together. He's always been one of my go-to guys over the last five years to see where the industry is going. But it's our belief that we're positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be successful. We're not going to be owning contents or not going to be competing with other content providers, we're going to be their best partner from a distribution perspective.
And I think that makes great sense for the company going forward.

You mentioned frequency, I mean, were you just having very frequent deals and now you won't for the rest of the year and therefore the profits will be stronger, just a little more clarity there. And then secondly on the restructuring programs, I haven't seen anywhere how much the programs is going to cost in terms of cash costs or hit the P&L. Could you give us some help there?","So let me start with the USRO profit first and then I’ll frame up the Q1 if you thinking about the profit decline in the first quarter for USRO. You know about half of that was because of the trade phasing and the merchandising effectiveness we talked about. There was another, probably third from negative mix, product mix and then a bit from volume. As I said, we didn’t -- we held our media investment behind, some of the good ideas that Ken took us through. So as the year unfolds, we expect a couple of things to happen. First, our price mix will improve as the merchandising effectiveness evens out and our trade spends phasing rebalances versus last year again as we -- as we try to highlight. Not only is there a merchandise effectiveness opportunity for us, we also set absolutely lower trade spend in our first quarter last year versus balance of that year and this year the phasing is really reverse of that. So that will be the first thing. Second is we do expect volumes to improve. We look at the phasing of last year’s volume growth. The comps get easier as the year unfolds. And so we expect that to improve. And then we expect the mix as well not to be as negative in the first quarter as it was in the first quarter. So that -- and again strong overhead control and some of the benefit of that $40 million in overhead savings will accrue to our U.S. retail business. Those are the factors that give us confidence. So we’re going to see better profit as the year unfolds. In terms of the restructuring charges, as I hope you understand, we want to make sure that we inform everybody internally on what those changes are before we start talking about numbers either in terms of positions or dollars. What I will tell you is that there will be some severance of fixed asset write-offs, probably about half of it will be non-cash when we do give you the figures.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GIS,Q1,2015,"Hi. I have a bit of general question. What do you think has to happen for the food industry to get out of, to me, what seems to be the fairly self-destructive pattern of heavy promotional spending right now? Do we just need and this is really across a lot of categories? I'm just curious, if someone just have to say enough is enough, I am going to loose volume in order to restore some, I guess, price rationality or are you just getting so much pressure you being the industry from large retailers to fund deal back that even if you want to be more rational it might be a little difficult at the current time?","So, Ken, its Ken Powell, and thank you for the question. I would say that we have albeit Q1 aside. And we can talk in more detail about how that played out in the comparison of this quarter to a year ago and some of the plumbing around that. But I would say in general as we look at price points, as we look at promotional discounts and this sort of thing, we have maintained fairly steady levels there across our categories. But to your general comment on what’s it going to take industry wide, I think all the roads lead to higher levels of innovation. I'm continuing to focus on brand renovation making sure that we have the right level of messaging behind our core brands and new products. I mean, I think ultimately innovation and capitalizing on consumer trends is what gets -- what gets us to higher levels of growth. And the reason we’re so certain of that is because we see that when we get that formula right, we get a very market response from consumers. We talked a little bit about some of the cereal changes in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms. Last quarter, we’re seeing the response very rapidly. This quarter we have developed now over the last year and a half and launched very good varieties of Greek Yogurt as an example and in support of those with very effective marketing campaigns and it’s very satisfying now for us to see those products to gain traction. We changed the formulation in the positioning of our core Yoplait original and that brand was up double digit this quarter. So behind consumer targeted initiatives, so ultimately the answer to your question, which I think is the right question is innovation, core renovation, strong consumer communication, that will get us where we need to be.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
GIS,Q1,2015,"Hi. I just had two questions I could. First one will be to just to better understand maybe this is with getting a more into the detail you were talking about there, Ken but within U.S retail to see sales down 5% and the measured channel data showing flat up a little bit, down a little bit, somewhere in that neighborhood. So I just want to better understand maybe this is the promotional spending year-over-year and that comparison that is the major driver of the GAAP if you will, sales in reported consumption and reported sales. Can you offer a little more color on it?","Yeah. Chris, this is Don. It really goes back to the point that Ken touched on that one into -- in terms of the phasing of our merchandising, as we talked about in June or July in our Investor Day. We’ve seen drop in merchandising effectiveness. We, General Mills, we the industry have seen that and it does take some time to reset the plans. And so we knew that the year unfolded that our merchandising expense whether you look at it as a percent of sales or cost per sold case, it will come down on year-over-year comparisons. But it’s going to take couple of quarters to work it through so that’s one of the reason that we signal that we expected lower profit in the first quarter versus last year where we still see full-year growth in the high-single digits.",2.0,2.0,2,0.0,0.0,2.0
ROLL,Q4,2015,"Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on that question prior on Boeing Partnering for Success. I was wondering if you guys could provide a bit more color on what that means for you? Does that mean you can get more share, but at a lower price or I mean any color would be helpful?","Well, that means if you can reach an accommodation with Boeing on that program that your current Boeing business here is protected for three years to five years, I think it's three and I'm sure it's three. So, you'll have no competition on your current business direct to Boeing, which is not a lot of our business, direct to Boeing, most of our business is to Boeing subcontractors.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Hi. I wanted to come back to that last point. A couple of observations. One you've made the comment essentially that the profit pool of the storage time that you are pursuing has declined because of pricing pressure. In kind you are actually making more investments to respond to that so you're actually participating in the lower profit pool, combined with it's just not clear to me that NetApp, HP, EMC and Hitachi are going to change their behavior. You could argue they keep getting aggressive to keep their systems in place even if it's below cost just to secure the maintenance streams associated with it. So I'm unclear. You’ve said a couple of different times you think you can generate leverage in the second half of next year. I don't think you’ve made the case why. It's not clear that you actually can return or improve your leverage even as we look out over a period of time. So I’d like to hear why you think you can improve your leverage, your profit rates given the backdrop?

","I’m happy to address that, Keith. If you look at where we are placing our investments, the big investment we are making in our commercial segment. That's adding commercial teams and in programs aimed at driving opportunity generation for the productivity of our commercial teams. Today our mature commercial teams operate well above breakeven levels of productivity. And so investments we make and we also have a very well understood pattern of how long it takes for us to bring on a commercial team, how long it takes for us to get that commercial team to be on the same curve as a mature team and that is on the outside four quarters. Now some of the investments we make will not just help with new teams we bring on they actually make our existing teams more productive as well. So, we are very confident that the first investment stream that directed at our commercial segment has a well understood pattern of payoff, pulling investment from that is what cost us growth, putting investment back there we know will not just drive growth, but also drive operating leverage. The second investment we're making is really in broadening our flash platform which is aimed at the large deal segment. I want to say one other thing. In the large deal segment, even as I said the price competition our win rates there are healthy. Well that's what's driving a faster growth for us in that segment. Fibre Channel is now almost a quarter of the mix of protocols. It was just 17.5% a quarter ago, right? So we're seeing really good progress there broadening our flash platform will only help that segment as well. That's sort of how I think about the investments and why they are not just supportive of growth but they are supportive of leverage as well.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Hi. It's John Roy in for Steve. Quickly on your profitability, obviously, it’s not going to come next quarter. Do you have any type of color you can give us on when it might be? And also, are you still seeing a 3x to 4x advantage in pricing even though with the discounting?
","And John on price performance it very much remains in place. I think as I have said before what we're witnessing are instances, numerous instances where our competitors already over the last few quarters I have said they are coming close to that cost in order to hold us off, particularly in large accounts and large deployments. We are witnessing even stronger pricing pressure where they're going under the cost in order to retain footprint. And as you can see, we don't back away just because someone is taking aggressive price, even with the pricing pressure our gross margin stays very strong. So price performance advantage is best reflected in how our margins are performed very much still in place.

","So, John, this is Anup. On the question of getting to profitability, the way we’re thinking about it is the investments we’ve talked in the first half of the year for next year is going to lead to a decrease in leverage as compared to margins of this year. So, if you compare first-half to first-half, you'll see a decrease in leverage. We expect however the investment that we're making that Suresh articulated will have an impact starting the second half of next year and therefore we should get back to showing an improvement and leverage in the model in the second half of next year as compared to the second half of this year.

GIS,Q1,2015,"Hi. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the U.S. retail profit performance. Specifically, Don, I wanted to ask -- you cited here unfavorable price realization mix and lower volumes as the contributing factors to the $155 million decline. Notably absent in these comments is comments about gross inflation and/or productivity savings in the quarter. Can you talk about this a little bit? Obviously it must've been positive, but I'm curious about magnitude of it and the pacing of these programs throughout the year?","David, as we -- as John reiterated today, we still expect 3% inflation for the year. We think it's fairly evenly distributed during the year, so we don't necessarily see any unique quarterly facing. HMM, our productivity savings from HMM are similar. So one of the reasons that we remain confident in guiding to a higher gross margin is because with inflation at 3% and HMM productivity savings over $400 million, we look at that as a net offset at least and part of that came through in the first quarter which is why it really wasn’t a contributing factor year-over-year.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Let's see the – looking out over the next 12 months, we don't expect the currency shift to hit us again, so that ought to be good news. And I think last year, we had a sort of a weak demand from the aerospace distributors in the aftermarket and that seems to be normalized and strong now. So, I think the defense programs are sort of tepid.

And of course, we are always monitoring the effectiveness of advertising programs, but we have, we have some very good performance behind advertising. We think that the sort of revised and renovated positioning for Yoplait Core Cup around the snacking benefits of the product, which we are running quite a bit has been highly effective and one of the reasons why we are seeing resurging growth there. Obviously, we have been communicating a lot about the product reformulations in Big G we commented on the growth in Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

How you think about that and if you think that will be helpful in giving you another tool to battle some of the industry dynamics?","Yeah Simona, let me start with the second part of your question which is really around the flash, All-Flash product question. As I said before, we absolutely believe that having the broad platform that spans every workload is important. We have also said that we have a very concrete plan for broadening our flash platform to compete in the entire space and that is still very much on target. You’d expect to see us -- you should expect to see us participating in the entire market with both hybrid flash and all-flash market if you will. The second question really around hyper-convergence versus convergence versus standalone storage. We still continue to believe while there is growth in hyper-convergence in certain workloads there is enormous growth in both standalone flash centric storage as well as converged flash centric storage. We still believe we have a very strong platform to address the entire spectrum of flash centric storage requirements and our partnership with Cisco and creating SmartStack converged infrastructure allowing us to participate really well in converged deployment.

We are feeling stronger in terms of our investment in sales and different countries. So country-by-country, we feel better about Europe now than we did, say, even a year or two ago.What I think is the difference between Europe and the United States is, they don't have the equivalent of cloud titans. And we haven't won major service provider titans. So we tend to have smaller wins, but many customers.And I think that's -- but country-by-country, the level of engagement, in fact, my -- our entire executive team was at a Europe customer session last -- was it last November? We were all there. It seems like forever, but it wasn't that long ago. And the level of intimacy that the team has developed with our customers especially in the developed countries Germany, U.K., France, Middle East, even Israel has been very strong.

We've tried to take advantage of lessons learned. We've created a buddy system to send our power users based here in the U.S. to be there on site as we go live and transition over the week shortly after going live. But this is really complex, because, remember, we're not just turning on some new system in Europe, we have totally changed how we run our business, as you've heard me say, do business with ourselves in Europe and change that operating model with the advent of a European headquarters and the advent of a shared service center, et cetera. So there is a lot of change we have to manage.

So maybe if you can elaborate on that a bit, how much of this is the cloud titans. What are you seeing from the specialty cloud providers?Are you expecting similar upside there? And why isn't - why isn't there more confidence in the sustainability of this kind of upside as we look a bit more longer term? Thank you.","Sure. Thanks, Samik. Well, as you know, Arista's cloud titan performance is consistent with the cloud CapEx reporting. In other words, some are experiencing strong spend, some are declining and others are cautious. So, given all the pluses and minuses, I think it's safe to say that for the year, we expect a flattish cloud titan spread.

And then, finally, just on BD, test question for Giovanni, if I can. I noticed you have a somewhat new vertical for BMS and so far, as having neuroscience. As you think about BD, what are the areas that you'll be looking to invest in? And roughly, how much are you looking to deploy on an annual basis for the next few years?
","Yeah, thanks, Navin. So let me just say very quickly. Yes, you are right. It is a tailwind, the $160 million, with respect to business development.
Actually, what we are doing, what our teams are doing in neuroscience is really interesting. We, obviously, over the last few years, built a very innovative model where through a network of partnerships primarily, a small team at BMS has been very successful in advancing an early portfolio that looks quite compelling at this point. So not a large area of focus from a sort of late-stage development for us yet, but an emerging franchise that could be important in the future. As I said earlier, we are going to be looking at continuing to strengthen our portfolio depending on, obviously, the assets that we look at and are available across all of the areas where we have expertise.
We haven't really given a target in terms of spend per year, but we've made it very clear that this is the No. 1 priority in terms of capital allocation strategy. The acquisition of MyoKardia last year is a really good example of the type of focus we want to continue to have going forward as a company. And I'll remind you, we have tremendous financial flexibility to be able to invest in the right opportunities and in the right science.
So with that, I would like to thank all of you for joining us today as we discuss this quarter. We delivered strong results consistent with our strategy. We've continued to grow revenue, execute on our launches and advance the pipeline. I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished so far this year, including so many of the important milestones that have been discussed during the call.
And as always, our team will be able to answer further questions you may have during the course of the day and the rest of the week. So have a good day. And thanks again to all of you for participating.

VZ,Q2,2018,"Hi. Thanks. And I also like to extend my best wishes to Lowell and congrats to Hans. Just a couple of topics, if I could.
First on the strategic side. As I listened to the management commentary over the past year, is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on-the-go across the country? And if this is the direction, how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends. Postpaid phone growth at the industry level has risen to more than twice the rate of population growth. Do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change? And the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.
","And Mike, I think I'd just add one thing. It's funny, when you're at this point in your career, you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions, but just asked in a different way. I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99, and we had about 20% market penetration on, you know, postpaid, and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where's the industry going. You can't possibly get any more penetration than you've gotten.
And at that point, I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans' home country, that was at 50% penetration, and we thought, ""Gee, we got all sorts of headroom."" And now we're over a 100% penetration and you see wearables, and with 5G, Hans mentioned this and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives. So, you know, I really don't think much about postpay or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth. There are so many things and we have literally 0% penetration in today that are going to be big businesses five years from now. That's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership team's philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing them the products that they're going to need -- that will be indispensable five years from now.

VZ,Q2,2018,"Hi. Thanks. And I also like to extend my best wishes to Lowell and congrats to Hans. Just a couple of topics, if I could.
First on the strategic side. As I listened to the management commentary over the past year, is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on-the-go across the country? And if this is the direction, how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends. Postpaid phone growth at the industry level has risen to more than twice the rate of population growth. Do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change? And the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.
","On the postpaid phone, we continue, you know, to see consumer demand there and we believe certainly when you give customers the opportunity to get on the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there. So I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall. But we certainly continue to see good consumer demand and we expect to continue to have postpaid phone net add growth going forward. And we'll see how that plays out across the rest of the industry.
But one other comment I'd just add on the network side is, in addition to the broadband piece, as we've talked about the strategy is it's once you have that pace, what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward, and we think we're in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps your questions, Mike.

","So maybe I can start with the network question that you had and broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have and I've been now working here for quite a while, I really like the assets we have and the ones we're building, that will give us the opportunity to be a much larger broadband provider. And I think the announcement that we did today that we now are having Houston as well and we will continue with that communication on the new cities we are going to deploy on. 5G gives us that opportunity.
But we need to remember when I talk about 5G, 5G is an access technology. There is so much more you need to do to actually have it. When I look what we're doing all the way from the data center with fiber, unified transport, multiservice routers the all way, I see that this is a big undertaking, but we are in the midst of it, and as I have said a couple of times before, I mean, we have been on to this Intelligent Edge Network right now for quite a while, and we see the benefits and we see the opportunity that it creates. So you're right, it, of course, is going to take time to have it across the country.
But as I mentioned, we're already now deploying fiber in 50 cities. So we will come back and give you more color to it. But I think we are preparing the network to be really using the network and levering the efficiency market. So that's for us a very important piece of it.

When I said the competitive intensity is higher, we are certainly seeing that reflected in longer sales cycle. We are seeing instances where discount of 90 points off are not just one-off, but fairly frequent and so we certainly are seeing a more aggressive pricing response from our some NetApp, EMC and others than we did in prior quarters. Now, there is a second factor that is also very relevant. The mix of large deals is moving up substantially for us every quarter. And so even as we see our larger deal that's really where they are more aggressive, so for us the impact is somewhat more exaggerated because more of our deals now are coming from greater than $0.5 million, greater than $250,000 deals they are being much more aggressive about defending share.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

And so, we are seeing a rather insatiable demand for our products for molecular testing that we believe will continue, certainly, through 2021 and probably well into 2022. It began certainly in North America and in the U.S., but we're looking outside the U.S. as well right now.

HSY,Q3,2020,"Hi. You know I'm curious, for the past several years, Michele, the majority, if not all, of the Company's organic sales growth has come really from pricing as opposed to volume or consumption growth. And much of this is obviously due to the success of the Company's new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that comes with it.I guess that said, as you look forward into '21 and beyond, I'm curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers. And if so, would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year? Thanks so much.","Yeah. Andrew, absolutely. I think we've shared before that we do view pricing as an important part of our growth algorithm, but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume.
We have good visibility into Q4 and 2021 and we do expect volume trends to improve, part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year, and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year.
I think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year and we feel good that the calendar of programming we have, the innovation, the media is really going to help to drive some of that.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Hope all is well. I want to pick up on the back of Chris' questions and tease out -- try to tease out a little bit more of the outlook on Holidays going forward. The Halloween early part selling was phenomenally strong, much better than I think anyone's expected, I think a big part of that is due to the merchandising programs that retailers had. It seems like they started bigger and earlier than they usually do.
Has that, do you think, influenced how they're going to approach other seasons going forward? So said more directly, you expect retailers to provide more merchandising support behind the category into Holiday, into Easter than they otherwise would coming out of the success they saw in Halloween?","So we've always had pretty strong merchandising support at every season and one thing we always think about with seasons is when we get it on the floor, because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product, whether it's Easter or wherever, early for in-home consumption, if you get it out there, it kind of spark the trigger of fun moments earlier.
So I don't know that I could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandise it even more than they ever have. I do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season, since that is the piece that is a bit more stable.
There were a few retailers, as you can imagine with the uncertainty of Halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with Halloween really had to be made in early May, when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants, and all of that.
So there are a few retailers, who had pulled back on Halloween. And based on the results of the season this year, they will likely have more confidence going forward, which should help to make for an even stronger Halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like Easter.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,1.0,2.0

If it’s an oil-spill it involves the oil company. If it’s a tank car spill, it involves the railroad. If it’s a pandemic, it usually involves the hospitals. Those people who are directly affected usually or immediately call their safety distributor looking for equipment. And it’s not just the protective apparel that we manufacture. We really stick to apparel, but they’ll call – they’re looking for respirators to, so they’ll be on with the distributor looking for respirators and they might call 3M directly, because 3M is the biggest manufacturer of the respirator, so it’s – really they usually call us. We’ll see it on the nightly news, and then the next morning they’ll call us. But we usually hear it before the nightly news. So – I mean that’s how we respond.

We're still working on that. And typically towards the end of the year, we normally put out a press release that talks about our 2013. So I'd expect something later this year or early next year on actual 2013. Obviously, we talked about in the past that we're increasing rig count in the Marcellus, and we'll exit the year with 4 rigs doing basically the horizontal work there. That will increase the capital budget on the Marcellus side, so I could see a weighting that's more Marcellus-oriented next year versus the dominant last few years where the Fayetteville has been 75% to 80% of the capital. You'll see that more balanced, may not be balanced, but more balanced. And then Midstream, in general, a lot of the work's been done on the Fayetteville Shale. And in the Marcellus, we've got another year in the same category we had now where it's $80 million, $90 million. So I'd say Midstream is flat or a little bit down is really towards the future.

So, I'm not sure I'm going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say, though, if you take a look back at the last eight quarters, we've been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between, you know, depending on the quarter, let's call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter, and that changes between desktop and notebook.

You will think of very simplistic approach but 30 years ago every hospital ran their own kitchen, every hospital ran their own laundry, every hospital had sprawling pharmacies in the basements. Today that's changed. Hospitals are focusing on what they do best and that’s bringing clinical care to the patients they serve. How do we set up our blood center customers to become more relevant in that process? Initially taking over the logistics of blood such that hospitals don't touch blood until they are ready to give it clinically to a patient, then what does mean in terms of overall cost efficiencies, effectiveness, quality of care?

And as you correctly raised, the FDA has not been favorably disposed to accepting progression-free survival as an endpoint. What we'll do is we'll complete that trial, look at the results, and then decide overall where we are as a company and what makes the most sense in terms of future filings for pixantrone in the U.S.",2.0,1.0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0

And I guess this is another way of asking, has Novartis sort of just backed out of their option for taking over Pixuvri in Europe?","Let me put it in this way. We know that Novartis has, internally, a threshold for a product to have to have at least $500 million in sales before they would consider it a product that they would take to market. So clearly, we've never considered Pixuvri in the EU to be a $500 million marketed product, so it would not be surprising that Novartis would not want to take it forward in the EU. And then obviously, with respect to other partners, as I've mentioned in the script, we have been forming and will continue to form channel partners. In Turkey, we have an existing one, and we'll have one in Israel. There are mid- to large-sized pharma that have interest in taking Pixuvri in rest of world. So into Eastern Europe, China, the Pac Rim, India, South America, et cetera. And so those are the things that can -- I'll turn it over to Matt and give you a little bit more color on that since it's been his primary driver for the first half of the year, that and the PIX deal -- the PAC deal.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0

As I mentioned again in my comments, obviously, we are seeing a lot of upgrade potential and upgrade happening from the installed base, but we're also winning a number of new accounts as I mentioned. The third point I'd make is, that the channel play with VNX is also very strong, with VNXe close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned, again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid-tier in total, the biggest piece is unified, is up 40% year-on-year.

Now the other interest, the largest component is factoring interest, along with amortization of loan fees, there's a little bit of cap lease interest and other interest.

Because if most of that business was done in the fourth quarter, that would seem to be a reasonable assumption.","Yes, I mean bookings historically has always accelerated in our fourth quarter. As I said in my commentary, it's a very -- the pattern of the business has been very consistent year-over-year. The first quarter is the lowest; second quarter is a little bit better; third quarter's quite a bit better than the second quarter; and the fourth quarter usually booms.

VRTV,Q4,2018,"I guess, I first wanted to touch on the inventory and accounts receivable. It seems like some of that was coming through in the Packaging segment that caused a little bit of the weakness during the quarter. But maybe you can give us a little bit more details on what drove some of that accounts receivable and inventory headwinds, and obviously, the unintended consequence of lower accounts payable, not really helping working capital?","Right. Great, John. Sure. So the bigger issue was really with accounts receivable less with inventory and it is geared more toward our Packaging business. We had a congruence of, what I would almost characterize as a perfect storm. As we went through integration, we were also incurring significant COGS changes from suppliers at a time when we were managing and moving tremendous amounts of data. And so there was a lot of change going on in the business and we were trying to manage all of it at the same time. And had we not had this inflationary environment, I suspect our outcome would be different today. So it was due to the complexity of the integration along with a lot of data and information moving to get the Company fully integrated with our system, along with a time period when we were receiving excessive cost and trying to manage price changes all at the same time.
Additionally, due to the nature, the historic nature of the Company, there were a lot of very specialized services provided in invoicing and billing activities that frankly, some of even our customers didn't realize was being done, and so we had some issues with things such as EDI transfer of accounts. So the good news is that they're all fixable and we actually didn't get worse throughout the year. We just didn't improve to the degree that we had hoped. And the reason that's important is because, we were doing major system conversions right up until the very end of the year. So we already started getting a handle on it in the first part of the year, but we had -- and it wasn't getting worse, it just wasn't getting better. So, that's a little bit on the AR side with Packaging.
On the accounts payable, slight surprise we had is, actually what happened was, we actually just didn't end up buying as much as we anticipated and that brought our AP levels down, which is a good news thing, because we saw some of the market softening a little bit in particular in Print, and so we pulled back on inventory levels and that had a negative impact on accounts payable.",2.0,0.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

TDC,Q1,2014,"I guess, Mike, if I was to look at the point solution market, and maybe split the question up a little bit, but if you look at the point solution markets in the broader ecosystem that are not Hadoop and you look at when you've faced this in the past, when Netezza was out there and people were doing data marts on open source like Postgres or MySQL, what seems to be the difference today? And what are your win rates today versus with the point solution data mart type appliance versus sort of when you just launched that appliance when you were dealing with guys like Netezza pre their acquisition?","I would say our win rates with our appliances are remaining fairly consistent with what they've been over the years, Bhavan. The -- I think the opportunity that's there that we need to participate more in is there's more granularity in some of these point solutions in the ecosystem, meaning outside of the integrated data warehouse. So there's workloads that don't require as much capability as we have in our appliances or there's workloads that need different types of analytics, hence, what we have with Aster. You can see other solutions from other companies that are out there in this industry, making a company and a business out of one specific solution that's going into the analytical ecosystem. So I would characterize it more that in today's world versus back a couple of years ago when there was Netezza or some of these other databases, there's more granularity of workloads out there in the analytical ecosystem to be addressed than what traditional database vendors did.

We have intensified our focus on expenses. We talked about that at the beginning of the year, saw some benefit in this quarter, as we've reported, and we're going to continue to be focused on it. And with that said, we're go to do so in a balance way. The success for Limited Brands is not to be the world's best cost-cutter. It's to have good top line growth in brands with emotional comps and great service experiences for customers in stores and online. But with that said, we are managing expenses with discipline. I would expect that we'll continue to do -- have some leverage in the back half of the year. That's what's implicit in our guidance. And we'll continue to work it. But again, we'll do so in a balanced way. And it's broad based, so we're seeing that benefit across the major parts of the business and, particularly, in the home office area.

And so I guess the question this, does that mean that we should see sustainable spending on tests within LitePoint into Q4? Or am I missing something there?","C.J., that's correct. We would expect a stronger Q4 than we traditionally had. So clearly, our plan is back-end loaded, and it's tied to, we think, the China 4G buying will starting to pick up, and we've gotten design wins. The trick for us though is, as we've gotten these very important design wins, it's also not quite clear how much we're going to get until the very, very end. We know we won, but are they going to give us 10%, 20%? What percent of the buy are we going to get? So even that's still in play now. So what we feel good about is we get those design wins and over time, similar to what we did in connectivity many years ago, you start as the low share guy, you work your way up over time.

How do you sit today, how do you think inventory will look at the end of the year, and then I guess – go ahead and answer that question first?","Well, certainly, Mother Nature has not – plays a role, has not cooperated, since we talked on our last call in May to the degree we would have hoped. That's certainly a part of it. So we didn't work it off quite as fast as we would have liked. So it will be up, and I think, when we talk about inventory, we put this into kind of our working capital context, and as you've seen we worked very hard to drive our working capital down as a percent of sales when we look at this on an average basis, and like we talked with you, because of the nature of our business with a couple of big quarters and a couple of relatively smaller quarters, we tend to want to look at the year and want to look at the year from a working capital standpoint. So, all-in, and inventories plays a significant role in that, we ended last year on an average working capital of 13.9%. That will be up closer to 15%; still good and still very much in with how we talked about, how we’re going to manage working capital. So, it’s not – it didn’t work out quite as fast, particularly on the Residential side as we would have hoped, but it’s I would characterize not a – we don’t consider it a problem, because it feels a bit of an opportunity. Then, as I said on the remarks, field inventory, well, up a little bit, particularly because we shipped in snow, but riders are up a little bit, and it is mostly on the Residential side.

FISV,Q4,2010,"I guess, the first question, just wanted to ask, talk about sort of the market, the macro sales climate and sort of the industry growth expectation. At your Analyst Day, just back in October, you sort of talked about 3% growth for the market. It kind of sounded like maybe you were tempering that a bit. I'm not sure if I heard that right. And if it is still 3%, I was just sort of curious that the midpoint of your internal growth is sort of smack in the range there.","Sure. So Glenn, when we were at Investor Day, we talked about our belief that over the next few years, that IT spending for the sector would average around 3% over that period. But that would build over the next several years, and we didn't expect that to be a flat line over the period and we see 2011 building into that average. So if you just use some simple math, you would expect it to be arguably lowest in 2011 and highest in 2013, just if you were seeing that kind of a bill. And our guidance contemplates that kind of a bill. Arguably, we've seen more optimism in the space over the last few months than we've seen really all of last year. That was apparent in our pipeline. It was apparent in our sales results, and frankly, there's a good level of optimism. I think we're taking a more measured and pragmatic approach, knowing that we need to see more than a month or two or three to believe that's enough to base all of our guidance on. So we're really using data points that stretch back from what we saw during the majority of 2010, what we're seeing more recently and the sales results that we had during the year. So all of that measures up to be, we would say, we're slightly more optimistic or I would say our clients are slightly more optimistic than they were several months ago.

So as we think about it, now that the tax sharing agreement is over, yes, it's a tough time to sell the business, it's an even more difficult time for us to be in the business. And so we felt like it will be the right time to just get moving. And to the extent that we want to -- if we have a view on met coal, it's part of the transaction, some form of the consideration as an upside for met coal, fine. I'm flexible on that. But I just don't think staying in a business where you don't have a recipe for success, and to wait for commodity prices to rise is good strategy for us.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"I had 2 questions, Charlie. I guess I was wondering I mean you guys disclosed in your filings how much of a -- how much revenue the U.S. federal government does.

And then when you think about how the quarter progressed, we obviously all know that your quarters and every software companies are back-end loaded in terms of deal signings. I'm trying to get a sense of, do you think the environment improved as the quarter went on? Meaning, was the weakness more pronounced in January or was it more pronounced in February?

So that's the second question. And then, what have you seen in terms of the deal signing environment and willing to sign deals thus far in March?","Okay. So first a couple of things from the commentary that you can probably deduce is that for us, the overall business was actually strong. You got, where was the weakness? We didn't see weakness. We had really strong bookings, and the overall performance was, sort of as expected, linearity. This was more of a quarter for us. It was kind of a 20-20-60 kind of a quarter. And I think as you heard me say before, a really smooth quarter for us would be 25-25-50. Something more back-end loaded is 20-20-60. But this is -- it's not unusual, it's still in the range of what's normal. Relative to the federal sector, we had 2 areas where I think macro was a factor. And I suspect every other software company has already experienced the same thing, whether they mentioned it or not, or is experiencing the same [ph]. First is the federal space. There's no doubt in my mind that the federal budget discussions that have been going on for some time has slowed down buying decisions in the U.S. in the federal government here. We're not aware of losing any business. It's just sometimes, it's just a little bit slower. The second area that -- from a macro perspective was evident is Japan. The economy there is a little bit sluggish, and the yen -- the devaluating of the yen was pretty significant. Overall, I would say, however, I mean our view is the business was strong. The message we're trying to get across is the business was good. I know the billings metric is a little different than what you probably had hoped for. But we get into a lot of detail to talk about the backlog. If you put those pieces together, you get a very good picture.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

But when you think, Chad or Peter, about what – the pace you're on of shifting your mix, what overall impact that's having to either gross margin or EBITDA? Any sense of how you're moving the needle through time? I'd love to just get a sense of that.
","That's a good question when you try to drown out all the other noise that's going on. I think if we execute on our strategic plan over the next few years of expanding value-add on the company as a whole, gosh, I could see by the end of say 2021 or so kind of a permanent improvement of 40 basis points or so in our gross margin would be, I guess, a best guess off the top of my head.

ENTR,Q4,2009,"I had a question sort of focused on Verizon, when you have other exciting ramps starting, but just when you talk about potentially seeing some sort of recovery end of Q1 maybe in Q2, can you elaborate a little bit on your assumptions there. Are you expecting some sort of bounce back in sub growth or just kind of a flat lining of the declines that we have been seeing, kind of what you're expecting?","Verizon's public comments have really been continue to focus on a million new – net new sub adds a year. So that would translate to about 250,000 a quarter. They did 300,000 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 last year and then they did I think 200,000 in Q3 and 150,000 in Q4. So, they ended up doing a million last year as well, but a little bit slow on the back half. I think with the promotions that they are running that say that they are getting initial success, I think it's trending more towards that kind of run rate type of a business, which should be somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000. As they have kind of gone through the slower period over the last couple of quarters, they have continued to order less and they are keeping inventory positions pretty tight. So there should be a spring back associated with that at some point. When accounting on that and our numbers that we provide for guidance for Q1, so if that happened in Q1, there could be some potential upside. But, assuming that they did get that kind of bounce back in Q1, we should see a Q2 bounce back pretty strong for us because there is not – like there is a ton of excess inventory in the channel and they continue to ratchet it down to kind of whatever the current run rate is.",2.0,0.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"I had two questions. The first one, just two relatively small ones. On the other expense commentary, I think through the -- through the year-to-date period, other expense is only a very small number, but your full-year projection in the $100 million to $110 million on that means it's a fairly massive number in the fourth quarter. Am I doing the math right? Is that correct on how the pattern lays out for other expense?
And then related just another follow-up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter, I think in your prepared comments you said North American organic growth similar to third quarter, but pricing only like a 0.5 point. So that would mean volume is something like 5 percentage points positive in the fourth quarter. Am I doing those two pieces, right? Any color you can give on those two comments.","Yeah, I'd be happy to. So on the tax side and other expense, you're exactly right, we will have a large other expense in the fourth quarter. That's consistent with what we've been saying even in the early guidance, earlier in the year and then along with that, a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter. If you do the math on the tax rate, you also have to settle for a lower tax rate. So that's how the -- those two lines will play out.
And yes, on the volume up in the fourth quarter, you're thinking about it the right way. We do have some inventory replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter, we saw that in the third, we'll see some more of that or that continue into the fourth. We're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year. And then, this continued strong share gains.

I think the number that you guys talked to for FY '13 in terms of bookings growth was about 17% versus the 14% billings growth profile. So you have about a 3 percentage point more growth in bookings versus billings. You saw a similar dynamic last year. I guess the question would be, is that 3-percentage-point excess in -- based off of the full year, would you expect that -- was that prevalent throughout the whole year or would you have a bigger sort of variance between the growth rate of billings and bookings in the fourth quarter in particular? Because I mean big deals tend to sign in Q4, not just this year, but every year.",The fourth quarter clearly would be the outlier of the 4 quarters because of the significant numbers of large deals in the fourth quarter.,2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0

Where do you see like dollar reported sales coming in using all other things, including M&A?","With M&A, it depends obviously when we are closing Annie's, but I wouldn’t tell you that we signaled through the couple set headwind from a forex standpoint on EPS, so let’s around that to a 1%. You can probably apply that same percent on our net sales if you’re going to get the reported numbers. Annie's is a $200 million, it would be more than that, but then we closed given its growth rate, $1 million business, and we are projecting to close that this calendar year. So we will probably get half a year of sales from that business as well. So add a $100 million for Annie’s or more and take off about a 1% from forex on top of the mid-single-digit guidance that we’ve given you on constant currency.

PM,Q3,2011,I just actually wanted to touch on Japan. You mentioned you feel comfortable that you're going to be able to retain around a 30% retail share in the market. So I was hoping you could give us a few more details on what you're seeing in this market in terms of the consumer purchase patterns and then maybe also relative to what JT has been doing to take back some of their share.,"Okay. The published shares that you see there are also -- I mean on JT's side, the shipment shares, these now in the quarter or year-to-date, are not really representative yet. I mean, it's simply the fact that, of course, the pipeline on JT's product had been empty and has been reloaded now to whatever JT considers to be a necessary level of their volumes. So in terms, really, of what sticks with the consumer, we simply have to wait a little bit until those shipment shares will equal really consumer offtake shares again, which -- as has been the case in the past. For now, I really think that the consumer offtake shares which we measure in the C-stores give you the best indication. This is, of course, not a national average. This is a snapshot. And also, in those stores, our shares before has been slightly higher than the national average. But we continue to see, even now in the beginning also of October, the very latest numbers, and we, of course, look at them every week, that our shares continue to be slightly above 30% with Marlboro shares in there being stable.

How is the growth in that business trending and what are your expectations for 2018?,"On the active market we see good trends going forward into the future based on just the amount of the equipment that came into the world in the early part of the decade; '10, '11, '12. Really put a lot of new equipment out there. They’re running the equipment longer and harder. So for us we do believe aftermarket will continue to be an area of growth and opportunity. We’ve done a number of different measures that we’ve talked about with pricing. We did that about a year and a half ago to make sure that we’re priced properly within the market and got our products positioned where we want them to be. We have LSW which continues to be a good growth asset for us in the aftermarket. And really from a sales environment, we continue to just look at our sales force in our organization to make sure we got everybody out there hustling as hard as they possibly can to hit every potential customer.

So broad-based speaking, I think the aftermarket will continue to be a positive growth engine for us. Clearly farmer incomes, the reports that we’ve all seen coming out of the USDA are not headline wise, they’re not great obviously but I don’t think there’s any reason for concern at this point that if farmer incomes are flat to down as they projected [Technical Difficulty] we’re going to have to do some replacement and maintenance on that which is good for our aftermarket business.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
PM,Q1,2016,I just have one quick question first on the pricing in Japan. When do you expect to hear feedback on your application? And is this price increase factored into your guidance?,"I think we should expect something as always in Japan I think within 90 days, if I am not mistaken. That's about the time period when the MOF has to come back with a decision. And to be very frank with you, that price in Japan, the price increase of a 10 yen on the – on these two brands, is not fully factored in our guidance. But let me remind you that if the prices are approved, they will go into the market in the later part of the year. And as you know, guidance has a number of variable components, and this will – we'll see how it unfolds. But factually this pricing is not in our guidance.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"I just have one quick question. Everything has been asked and answered. You made a reference in the prepared remarks about Pirate's Booty is tracking ahead of your strategic plans. Can you talk about what are the key learnings that you've developed through your years as the CEO that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and implemented, what are your key learnings and what do you take forward to future learnings -- the future acquisitions?","Well, so I think a lot of learnings along the way. I guess I would start with, there is a business model for brands that that we as a company are best with and that is branded items, where brand matters, where the business has significant scale probably close to that $100 million mark and it needs to be a business that has a high gross margin, because that's what our business model is. We're a branded company, we invest a lot in marketing and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow, invest and grow. And we -- that's our model. That's what we need. So I think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset.
I think secondly, really understanding the strength of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dives on which KPIs, we think predict the ability for a brand to scale.
And then, I would say really trying to scale the business well and I would say, hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way, as you know in the past, we bought some businesses that were too small, we bought some businesses that had lower margins and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well and I think we've done a very focused effort on the scaling as well and we've gotten much better at that, relative to supply chain, relative to the talent that we need, when we buy a company like this, where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit, we want to keep people who know the brand and the business.
But we also have to be focused on the point that we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. So I mean, I go back to the scale, the branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones and then picking the right underlying KPIs that say it's a sustainable business, because if we can do that, we can make it home.

DELL,Q3,2011,"I just want to delve a little deeper into your comments on the financials and the federal verticals, which doesn't sound like you had issues that others have been seeing. Does your commentary about the linearity of the business also apply to these verticals? And in particular to federal, was the budget flush in the U.S. as you expected or was that more attributed to share gains there?","I believe in the federal. Obviously, it was the quarter end for federal, so there are always some budget flush in the federal and we saw some of that. And I do believe we took some share, specifically, in the mid-tier product family. When you look at the power of the VNX, the VNXe, the unified, the Data Domain and Avamar products, we have tremendous portfolio there.

DTLK,Q2,2008,"I just want to first start on the macro commentary. The sense is that while it looks like the results aren’t really seeing any pressure at this point, the tone sounded like you could be seeing a little bit of incremental either elongated sales cycles or decision cycles. Can you elaborate on what you’re seeing just in the current environment and maybe what trends have looked like thus far in to the month of July?","We continue to see good activity in July as we’re a couple of weeks in to the quarter. So, we haven’t noticed any significant change from how we exited the second quarter. I think our commentary as it relates to the macro environment is just a reflection of caution out there and scrutiny of deals. I wouldn’t say that deals from my perspective are being any more or less scrutinized than what we’ve seen earlier in the year but that continues to be a variable that you have to factor in as you look across the pipeline of opportunities and as you think about what expectations and performance results you can drive. So, I think we continue to see an environment that is pretty similar to the environment that we’ve been living in throughout the first half of this year. Obviously, that’s a view of the world on July 16th, things can change in a way that’s more adverse to what our opportunities are but, that’s what we see today.
And as I look across the pipeline throughout the rest of the quarter, the back half of the year, we have, as we’ve seen in previous quarters, see some projects that may have been delayed or maybe decreased in amount due to some of these external considerations. And, on the other side we’re seeing projects that maybe are getting accelerated relative to original expectations or being increased based on compelling technologies that can drive significant ROI opportunities for our customers. So, longwinded way of saying it, it’s counter bailing, it’s balancing right now both ways. I don’t see a marked change today from what we’ve seen earlier in the year.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

PTEC,Q1,2009,"I just wanted a bit of clarification on just a couple of restructuring issues in licensing or the turnaround opportunities. Just firstly on the tax side, is there any way of structuring the business such that; obviously it is loss making at the moment, but it doesn’t pay tax and whether that can change going forward? Then really on a more sort of like top level macro view, the business obviously has got $30 million of cash, generating sort of gross profit of $60 million a year and if you just run those basic numbers through and that’s really excluding the sort of the beneficial effect potentially of the tax losses brought forward and obviously the great technology. You can see that the external investors would perhaps value this business significantly higher than the current share price and therefore really whether the board has any view in relation to strategic reviews, not just the turnaround side but also of a more generalist approach. They are really the first two questions?","This is Rich; let me just give a comment on the tech side. This company has a couple of significant things in respect with tax. One is it has substantial tax attributes in the United States that will give it a very low tax rate for a significant period of time to come in terms of U.S. taxes. However, our principle tax expense is in Taiwan, where many of our customers and particularly the ODMs live and where this company has for a long time had a running dispute and indeed negotiation with the Taiwanese tax authorities. So, we have a fairly sizable accrued tax liability and we continue to accrue incremental taxes at a rate which runs of the order of magnitude of 8% to 10% of top line revenue, which is an extraordinarily high number, particularly during loss making periods and management is working hard and spending quite a bit of money and trying to resolve that issue.

EXPE,Q3,2010,"I just wanted to ask about international bookings and in particular, obviously a tougher comp versus the last quarter. But looks like you did see some deceleration there. Can you talk about what you're seeing in Europe in particular and how you think you're doing in terms of share and in particular, on the agency hotel program with Easy Manage?","I'd say in Europe, we're doing well. I think that we can do better. In general, the gross bookings number on a year-on-year basis in Europe came down a bit as we were rolling over the fee cuts that we put through last year. Revenue on an international basis x FX improved on it on kind of a quarter-to-quarter basis mostly because of revenue per room nights getting much better than they did last quarter. So I'd say on an international basis, in general, we're satisfied with our progress. In Europe, we're satisfied with our progress. hotels.com on balance, I think, in Europe is doing better. I think Expedia's performance is okay, and it's something that we expect to get better on a go-forward basis. The Easy Manage properties, we've got around 8,000 of them. We've added around 8,000 of them year-to-date. The concentration of those properties is in secondary and tertiary markets. And in some of those markets, we are seeing ranges of 10% to 20% of our bookings being Easy Manage properties. And we think over time, as we establish those Easy Manage properties, as we move them up in the sort order and the new hotels that we're adding mature in our inventory set, we would expect that the percentage of bookings that come through Easy Manage as a percentage of our total bookings especially in secondary and tertiary markets should get higher than the levels that they are now, which is kind of a 10% to 20% level. So we think that we'll see improvement there, and we're happy with the progress. But we think we can do better.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

First off, we do not discount to get dollars upfront. We have money sitting in the bank earning almost nothing. It makes no sense to discount to -- just to get the cash coming in upfront. This is mainly, as you get bigger deals, companies don't want to write that big a check, and I think they're beginning to buy in to the value of a subscription model. I don't have all the top deal payment terms in front of me, but I know that the large 3 deals that were over $10 million, all of those are paying over time versus paying upfront. It just makes sense, it's large dollars, it's becoming a material line item for those companies. They're getting the value of a subscription over time, why not pay for it over time.

SXC,Q1,2014,"I just wanted to talk about the increase in CapEx in Indiana Harbor a little bit. I was wondering if you could help us understand some of the offsets to that. Perhaps some of the offsets are an increased EBITDA margin that you can earn longer term, or maybe you can quantify the reduction in maintenance costs and the benefit of the higher charge that you talked about. I'm just actually trying to understand, this incremental CapEx, is that 100% hit on your chin? Or what are the sort of incremental cash flow benefits that we should think about?","Yes. Well, think about this post 2014, because it's really executing the project into 2014. But historically, if we would have problems or holes in the oven floors and/or repairs that we need to make sole flue issue, we'd do it with silica wells, which is maintenance expense. That process is effective when you have small, relatively small changes, it is pretty expensive and very, very intrusive if you have to do it on a more extensive basis. So the alternative approach, as we said, we spend about $15 million of capital. What does that do? It shortens the time associated with repairing the oven very significantly, number one. Number two, we think we can get at least 1 more ton of charge rate going forward, which in and of itself is a reasonably attractive return, relative to the silica welding that you did before, and you wouldn't get the additional 1 ton . And then ongoing maintenance expense going forward. When you silica weld, you're generally silica welding about 6 most to 3 years later, because it doesn't -- it's not a permanent fix, it's just ongoing maintenance. This would be a more permanent, as you can see from the picture, this would be a more permanent approach. So we do think this is actually number one, a better way to do it relative to silica welding; and number two, we do think it actually generates a return on investment. I'm not prepared today to say anything other than the additional 1 ton of charge weight, actually there is a return for that. And it's just a much better approach. Which we frankly came up with as we looked at the situation in the first quarter and looked at the -- we took an inventory. So it's about 1/4 of the ovens in the plant where we felt like we needed to do this. And frankly, our team that's been working on it came up with this approach, that was a much better, more intelligent way to do it, and we think will generate a return for us longer term.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
PM,Q1,2016,"I just wanted to – first again on Indonesia a little bit. You talked about targeting double-digit profit growth in that market this year. When we think about Indonesia over the long term, is this – should we think about it a little bit differently where maybe it will be more of a profit growth market and less of a kind of volume revenue market going forward? Or is this just a one-time factor in 2016? And then maybe we get a little bit more volume growth in the out-years?","Well, Bill, to be frank I'm sure am thinking Indonesia can have all three, i.e., can be a volume, revenue and a bottom-line OCI growth target. We still remain confident in the longer run, Indonesia total market can be in the growth rate over somewhere around 1%, 1% to 2%. We have said it on a number of occasions in the past that depends on the macroeconomic factors which may impact temporarily the purchasing power, et cetera. The market may have some slowdown, I think what we observed, that we forecast to observe this year, due to the – a bit of a – the softer – due to the softer economy, et cetera. Then Indonesia maybe go into some decline this year. But pricing remains strong. The cost outlook for Indonesia, I mean, it seems pretty positive. And therefore, we're very confident that this year as in the years in the past, I mean Indonesia, not only will it grow double-digit bottom line, but also, can remain a very significant contributor to overall PMI performance. So I'm very positive on Indonesia, both in the short and the longer term.

SANM,Q4,2012,"I just was going through a scorecard of what you guys have accomplished in the last three years where your book values increased from like 7.25 to 11.50. You’ve paid down debt and you’ve done a really nice job. In prior years, it looks like when you’ve had losses they’ve mainly been below the line items, intangibles or acquisitions or shutting down divisions. So as I look forward – and I’m just projecting this out, with lower interest expense going forward now that your debt is lower, it appears that the company could throw off $600 million in net income in five years, and you have a $600 million market cap today. And I realize you have about $400 million in net debt. So I guess my question is, if the company continues to generate this sort of earnings in a flat environment, one, what level of debt would you like to get the company down to; and then two, what do you start to do with the free cash flow? And I’m not necessarily asking you to back the free cash flow numbers or the net income numbers I’m giving, but at some point, the amount of cash you’re generating relative to your market cap starts to become ridiculous. And I don’t think analysts are assuming any sort of assumptions with those cash flows in their forward models when they give 4x and 5x earnings multiples to your stock.","Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate the observations and comments. With respect to your question on target debt and our plans over the next – longer period, I’d say five years or so, we haven’t put a specific target out there. Obviously the last – probably even the last decade, one of the key goals of the company has been to deleverage, and we’ve made a lot of progress on that over the last three years. If you go back to the recession, the gross leverage peaked at something over 8, and I think if you do the calculation now you’ll see it’s around 3. I believe that we’re in a new equilibrium at this stage. We certainly have some appetite for continuing to deleverage, but we can make opportunistic decisions in terms of what we choose to do going forward. So – and by that, what I mean is we’ll make good capital allocation decisions. There may be times when it makes sense to repurchase more debt and there may be times when it makes sense to repurchase shares, there may be times when there are small strategic acquisitions that make sense and are synergistic with our strategy. So I really do believe we’re in a new equilibrium now. I, again, can’t say what our plan is over the next five years, but if you look at the last five years, as you noted, we’ve generated a lot of cash, and we think we’ll be able to continue to generate cash going forward. And I think we can make some good decisions here over the next few years that will really benefit shareholders. And I guess the final comment I would make is, on your observation, I agree with you, I find it remarkable that our company trades below book value with our ability to generate cash, and I think at some point in time, the market will catch up with that.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

That had recently completed their tender. The combination of ABC and GSABC, these are really a GPO type focus. They have a new CEO who came in there last year, very focused, very aggressive in his approach to that market.

We continue to hold a fair amount of business with ABC, to a lesser extent GSABC as well. They are going to continue on with those contracts, so our ability to prove out our blood management remains an opportunity there as well.

And I think if we can get a licensing deal that would absolutely supercharge. Because as I said to Michael, the big companies have hundreds and hundreds of sales people worldwide. So it is obviously a whole different potential to be quick. In wrapping up, if that is, that is if that is done as a deal. You can discover, yes, it is going to be a bit lumpy, because I said, some deals can mean as low as $10,000, some couldn’t be over $100,000, or euro. So in one quarter, you might get a couple in the next quarter, you might not but I think through the year, I would expect to see a few. And I would expect that to pick up strongly through next year as well. So and it is, we will provide guidance, as soon as it becomes clear the mixture, how discovers going how Vet going, and potentially licensing deals, we have a potential licensing deal being discussed also in the human space. In Asia, that may or may not happen, but that would also change how things look as well. So the package should become a lot clearer through the year, but I would expect to see a slow steady gains with a Vet and then the big movements would be either on the national or international launches and or on a licensing deal. And discover will pick up I think quite strongly through the next few quarters, but could be lumpy, some quarters could be quite good. And some could be smaller, just because the nature of how it looks in deals. Does that make sense?",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

So, I mean specifically in the satellite business, especially once we are moving to a run-rate like we are with EchoStar, we been kind of in a more mature business state for the last couple of years. That business experience is a little bit of seasonal softness in Q2. With DIRECTV, we are not rolling on a run rate business. We are continuing to ramp CSS and the SWM DISH antenna. So, it's possible you get a little bit of seasonality there. It's possible that we kind of grow through it based on the product cycle that we are in there. And then on the MoCA business, I think we are definitely more in a product cycle type of structure. And then silicon tuners, they have a little bit of seasonal softness in Q1. As we go into Q2, there's definitely not going be anything softer than Q1. So, you probably should see flatter growth.

That 36% to 24% gap is a good indicator of the fact that we are -- that our average revenue per active account is continuing to increase and the penetration of our active accounts is continuing to increase. So, we'll continue to see that delta. Again as Karen mentioned, as all these new sales reps continues to get through their first three, six, and nine months, new sales reps are always developing new accounts. So, we have lots of optimism that we'll continue to see growth in active accounts as a catalyst and part of what's going to drive our confidence in the back half of the revenue growth. And then we also do talk about there is a robust pipeline of accounts that haven't hit the active account list yet that are in some stage of evaluation.

We now got the absolute ideal product assortments in our stores. I mean, we continue to learn, not every at bat is a base hit or a home run, and fundamental way we driven the business for really forever, is to try to evaluate what's working, to weed out the least productive aspects of our merchandise mix and take shots and strategic shots to generally improve the assortments.

We continue to increase prices in our bra. And in fact, the Date Bra and now the Wear Everywhere Bra are doing very well. There's comparable pricing in the panty business. We do have a good, better, best reach strategy in the apparel business, so I think it's very well balanced. And so I think we are constantly looking at the opportunities that we have there.

When you come to -- when we talk about overall volumes that the Russian market has slightly declined last year at about 2%, I would say. For this year, I would expect a little less than 2%. But there is, of course, the consequence also of the fairly frequent price increases that happened in the market. So in that sense, consumers have been forced to upgrade quite a bit because prices over the last 3 years have come up quite a bit at the low end.

Maybe incrementally, can you talk about what vertical are you seeing -- in what verticals you're seeing that slight incremental weakness that now leads you to believe you're not going to see the fourth quarter as you hope you would see?","Well, just to use a little prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush, but what I try to be -- give you is -- I'm seeing, I think that our budget flush is likely to be real and meaningful, but perhaps slightly below what we've seen in other years, Q3 to Q4 growth. So I still think it will be fairly good. Within that, I mentioned areas to watch where public sector, what was happening in southern Europe, what was happening with commodity pricing. You go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far, we're not seeing this public-sector growth slow in the U.S. or in federal government. But we did see some public sector -- a little bit of public-sector slowdown in Europe. I had talked about southern Europe, certainly, that's something we continue to watch and how that impacts on the Eurozone. On the commodity front, you read what I read, again, that oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too potential -- too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector, everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe, in some of the Eurozone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing.

And just a little more color on, what did you observe relative to sequestration and its impact on federal government behavior? In other words, are projects being postponed for a quarter or 2, or do you think that they're being canceled altogether?","Good question, Mark. You've heard me say at a couple of analyst days, typically, either financial services or government are 1 and 2. Sometimes, they switch positions at who's #1 and 2. And it is clear that although we had some sizable government deals that were in the top 30, it would not have put them in either the #1 or 2 position in terms of verticals in the fourth quarter. Finance has still been very strong, tech and media has been strong. I think you heard Jim say that the largest deal for the quarter and for the year was in the healthcare sector, which is really interesting and I think encouraging because it's a brand -- it's not a new sector, but it's a sector in which we're underrepresented. I think we've got a lot of runway there. But part of the question about the sequestration, I mean, this has been -- it's not new. It didn't happen on February 28. They've been discussing budget issues and government shutdowns and sequestration going on for almost -- more than a year. And I'd say in the back half of this year that it has gotten more pronounced. As I said, I don't see us losing deals in the government. We have really good government business. And because we have a renewable revenue model, we see the business we have coming back.

I know Steve throws things at me when I mention the volume word, but we'll do that by improving our win/loss ratio. I mean, we need to win more business, and stop losing some of the business that we have. And that needs to be in our core distribution business, not in large volume markets where we may compete with our suppliers. And that's really a game of singles rather than homeruns.

And how you believe Stryker’s spine franchise can be competitive and in front of the Mako spine launch?","Yes, thanks. Listen, we are big believers in enabling technologies. We obviously have that with Mako. We did the Mobius acquisition and we're very excited about the imaging aspect of that. We do have a gap in spine robotics and we do believe that the first foray, the two competitive systems on the market today are really - are really good guidance systems for the placement of pedicle screws, and but it's providing value to surgeons, and we definitely want to have something like that on the market, which was what Mobius was working on.

Dave, you mentioned that Isilon, as you said, making life more difficult for the competition in general-purpose, file-based workloads. Could you add a little bit more color there on where Isilon is gaining share and why?","Yes, sure. I mean, we wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in a kind of more vertically oriented marketplace, is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale-out file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon is you start small and you basically add to the systems and it scales linearly. It has a very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems well often. Other vendors will have multiple filesystems that will try and do a single job, and there's a lot of load-balancing going on between those filesystems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amounts. And all the example I mentioned on the call were examples where we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors. And then in the vertical markets, obviously, places like oil and gas, media, where it's becoming a household name, et cetera, still going very, very well. I think the message here is that what we've got with Isilon and with VNX and with Data Domain is in each cases we've got a best-of-breed platform, and the best-of-breed platform is providing better utilization, better returns and is not providing a compromise compared to a one-size-fits-all, and that seems to be the solution that's winning in the market right now.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0

Are you seeing anything different now versus a few months back?","Well, John, I would say that if the question was directed at the size of projects, there are some magnificently large projects out there. They just tend not to be in the U.S. They tend not to be core-centric. I mean, there are some core changes going on outside the U.S. And frankly, there is one or two large core changes going on here.

Where did the cash go, is this all working capital, if it was, it was my expectation that in the first quarter it was a big use and the second quarter it was to start to be a source for the DistribuTech business.","When you think about it, definitely, our cash flow runs seasonally on the ongoing part of the business. First quarter is typically a bigger use of capital just because of the prepaid RDAs that we talked about. With this year, first and second quarter, as we have been transitioning the business, you have some additional cash requirements that we relate to settlements or statements.

GVNC,Q2,2008,"I was just wondering because by the time 92 events have achieved in the fourth quarter at least 75 patients would have been enrolled this year. Now, will the new patients skew the medium survival to the left? Because I don’t know how would you comfort somebody who has been on the trial for just three to four months, I mean, is that going to skew it to the left?","Well, the thing about survival analysis is that all patients are taken into account. And that adds to the robustness of the total data set. So, I don’t know necessarily whether enrollment in ‘08 matters substantially overall to what is going to come. The 92 events will be analyzed based on the survival, obviously of those 92 patients but also in comparison to the others. So, I don’t think that a wave of patients enrolled this year necessarily impacts the data all that much. I think, the upside of the trial with regards to the length of time it’s been filed for all these patients is that there has been a tremendous length of time to be able to properly analyze survival on a very substantial number of patients. And as we near the 92 events I think most of the robustness of the data has already happened. I think really, these final handfuls of patients are just probably not going to impact too substantially on the data. It’s probably already occurred or it’s not occurred based on probably the patients that gotten afraid in the last couple of years.",2.0,1.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

The bad news is that they are not as had previously been anticipated, shipping significantly above their original purchase forecast.

A year from now it might be $50,000; the year after that it might be $100,000 or a couple hundred thousand. It is important to retain these customers. So as we've described before, we have employed a third-party renewal company to help with those renewals on a global basis, and we have sort of outsourced to them renewals below certain levels in each region and had some very good results with it. So that's been very positive. We also have put in place a number of programs internally to improve the data to go after these accounts. And we've made good progress.

We're not the primary thing in really any of their bags. And so they're providing our product as a service to the people that they -- and surgeons that they already know. So, it was only a targeted few of them that had the distractions, but -- and it wasn't all one thing. So, it really is just digging in and solving that problem.

In that case with some people in their team, so we wanted to make sure that we could provide them training and help them come up the learning curve.

But the question is, is there something different you did there because that looks like a really encouraging rate.","There are some things we did different. As Bill mentioned in his comments, the 2 vertical wells we drilled, the first thing we want to do is determine if there was extent to the high pressure area; there was. But the other thing we found in -- and if you remember back to our very first well, one of the issues we had was trying to get enough vertical to extend our fracs. We found as we evaluated the BML well that we still weren't getting the growth and height on our fracs that we were looking for. So we tried several different kinds of fracs on both the Johnson and the Dean wells. And in some cases, they worked; in some, they didn't. In the Johnson well, I can tell you 2 of the 5 I think we've done so far, we screened out early because the frac that we're trying didn't work but as we got towards the end of frac-ing in the Johnson well, we came to what I'll call a new formula. There's nothing magic about it; just kept tweaking. And it looks like we're getting better vertical height. We tried that on the Dean well and well, there's 3 intervals, we frac-ed -- on that well 3 separate fracs, and the perforations, as we said weren't much perforation. There's about a 200-foot interval. It wasn't anything unusual over any of the other wells in the area. But when you look at the fracture area that it looks like it's contacted versus in the BML well that has over 4,000 feet, it's got almost 60% of the same fracture area. So it looks like we're starting to learn something on the fracture stimulations. And that well has held up very well. The numbers he quoted were on a 10/64 choke, and we still have high 6,000 pounds bottom-well floating tubing pressure -- of bottom-hole pressure. So that well gives us encouragement and we're using a variation of that. For the most part, we're trying some things on the horizontal we're frac-ing right now. But we're using a slight variation of what we did on the Dean on this horizontal that we're working on now. So I can't say it's the answer, but I can say that we're getting closer just by working on the fracture simulation. And it looks like we're getting a little better height than we were in any of the other fracs we've done today.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Are you seeing signs that decision-making is still frozen because customers are still in the process of planning out their next 2 or 3 years of -- or more of data management architecture?

So in a subset of our 50 largest customers in the Americas, I mean, we have clear innovators that have been at this a long time, and their analytical ecosystems or their architectures are more thought out and are more in process, although I'd still say not -- it's still evolving. Then you run into another subset in the top 50. I'd characterize it more as early adopters, and they're still experimenting and they're finding out some things on their own around what some of the alternative technologies can do and what it can't do and what type of workloads, different technologies could be good for outside of the IDW. And then, as you get out into the broader market, they're still in the very early phases of looking at this. And I wouldn't say categorically everybody. You run into smaller companies that are doing things with the newer technologies. But the other point here is, in addition to devoting a lot of resources and energy out into the analytical ecosystem, we still have a lot of them in top 50 that are building out their IDWs.

I believe it was 65,000 into the second quarter. And also Gracia, what was the daily and Sunday circulation volume percent change in the quarter for U.S. Community Publishing? And I have some follow-ups.","Sure. Let me start with the second question, which is with respect to daily volume at U.S. Community Publishing. In the third quarter, down about 7%. That's actually better than the second quarter, which was down around 8%. And then on the Sunday, down about 11%, which is again a bit better than the second quarter, which was down a little over 12%. With respect to the metrics around our all-access content subscription model, the one that I think -- in addition -- well, there are several metrics we pay a lot of attention to. Victoria just articulated one of the most important, which is the fact that we said we were going to add about $100 million to operating profitability, and we are absolutely on course to do that, if not slightly better than that. That's one of the most important metrics. I think the second metric is that we had said at the get go that we expected ultimately to get to about 60% activation of the digital subscriptions that we were providing as part of our all-access content subscription model. At this point, Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're at about 53% comp -- against all of those units, but we have probably a dozen places where they're above 70% or 65% or 70%. So we feel very good about being well on track with the digital traction that we expected to achieve out of this initiative. We're at about 1,500,000 digital subscribers who have activated their -- all-access subscribers who have activated their digital part of their subscription. One of the smallest metrics is with respect to digital-only for 2 reasons. One is that we have spent a heck of a lot more time focused on digital-only plus Sunday. And we've seen about 10% or so of the digital-only subscribers quickly become digital-only plus Sunday. And frankly that is an incredibly valuable subscriber to us because, as you well know from following us as long as you have, Craig, that Sunday is such an important day for advertising and to have additional Sunday exposure is incredibly important to us. We have also -- that number is probably in excess of 75,000 or 80,000 at the moment, but frankly that's probably one of the least significant and important metrics that we have used to determine the success of what has been just an extremely successful initiative for the company.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

There are a couple of vendors that have some clear momentum, there are others that are trying to get in to the game so this is clearly not an established or mature market by any means. I don’t have numbers that say what our total disc business is but it’s certainly growing at a pretty good clip. But, I would still say it’s a fairly small percent of our overall disc business. So, still some significant upside in that part of the market and that is one of the technology drivers that Charlie alluded to that’s driving opportunities for customer deals.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
SPTN,Q4,2014,"If I could just ask one final question, I know you’ve had a lot of super center exposure over the years in Michigan, but in terms of the recent square footage growth with neighborhood markets, are you seeing any kind of incremental impact both from the standpoint of your wholesale customers and with your own retailing operations? It seems like there’s been a lot of growth in that format very recently and I think they’re also comping in the high single digits?",We’re seeing those numbers being reported. We don’t have any neighborhood markets in the Michigan marketplace. We have experienced the neighborhood market activity in the Nebraska marketplace and they actually recently expanded with neighborhood markets in the past couple of years. I think the total number of neighborhood markets I think in the Omaha market is up to seven or eight right now and they’re all relatively new.,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,"If we could circle back on just the overall EEMA organic profit growth. That accelerated quite noticeably in Q3, 14%; 5%, Q2. How much of that is simply due to PMI slowing up its brand spend back? How much of that is just due to the markets' very strong pricing and volume growth? And then related to do that, is PMI happy with where L&M is in the EEMA region? Or is there still more work to do?","Well, if you look -- I mean, if you look at the brands there, and now we talk EEMA region as a whole. Then in the third quarter, I see a Parliament growing 15.9%. I see a Marlboro growing 10.2%, and all our premium brands then together by 10.5%. That's pretty good, I would say. If I then look at L&M, which yes, has left -- or has had problems in Russia. But if you take L&M for the EEMA region, it's up 6.1% and on a year-to-date basis, 3.8%. So no, our portfolio is doing pretty well. The negatives, you have a lot of heritage brands. But the future, of course, and the profitability is not in the previously local acquired brands. It's in our international brands in that part of the world.

NAFC,Q4,2007,"In looking at acquisitions in the future, would you be willing to go beyond that 3 times debt-to-EBITDA if attractive acquisition was out there or is that kind of where you see it capping out at?","Well, I mean, again, we use the 3 as a pretty strong indication of our intentions. I would never say that we wouldn't go more than that but I would tell you that as we take the leverage up, the returns have also got to go up and the risk has got to be managed. So from my perspective, as we began to think about higher leverage then we also have to think about how do we manage low risk and how do we generate higher returns because you when risk effect a large deal it really demands that you have stronger returns than something that you can take in on a tuck-in acquisition that has build-in synergies and is easy to do.

So I don't know that I see us doing that, Karen, but clearly, if it were something that creates shareholder value and something that was manageable and something that made sense and the only thing standing in our way was the fact that we needed to go beyond the 3 range to get it done then I don't think I would sweat that a lot.

The other thing I would say is if we do acquisitions right, I don't know that I always see that there should be a substantial jump in leverage if you're buying cash flow because the cash flow management is part of what helps keep that ratio in line. So by definition, if you are acquiring something and your leverage ratio is jumping dramatically it can only mean that you paid a lot for it or that there weren't enough -- the synergies just going to take quite a while to come. And I don't really see us doing a deal where we've got to wait a long time to get the synergies to justify the returns and get our leverage ratio back down where it needs to be.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"In regard to 2012, I was hoping you could give a little bit of color on how you're thinking about next year. I think in 2010, and then here in 2011, you started off with pretty limited sales growth outlooks and have far exceeded the initial outlook. So, curious how you're thinking about 2012 from a sales and margin perspective. Any color you can give would be helpful.","Well, we won't provide a lot of color, Mark, but we'll certainly do that in much more depth when we have our next call in December. Now with that said, like others we're trying to anticipate to what degree the economic environment will improve or worsen. That certainly will influence our forecasting. We still have our Destination 2014 goals in place. So, while we'll certainly exceed our revenue goal this year, well exceed the $100 million, it'd be closer to $200 million. That $100 million is still in place, $100 million for 2012. On a year-over-year comp basis, snow, we’re going to be comping against a strong year, still relatively smaller part of our business. On the other hand, spring and summer products, particularly in the residential arena, should be easier to comp. The hope would certainly be that weather is not as much of a negative headwind as it was in 2011. So that should go on the positive side of the ledger. Some of the acquisitions that while smaller still will move us in the right direction as we move in 2012. Commodities, that’s something we are looking at closely and trying to – that will tie to some degree into the economic recovery. And so, if the recovery continues or strengthen, we know we’ll see some commodity pressures and we got to factor that in, we’re all guessing a bit at that. We have the Romania plant coming online. So, we are going to look unless we face a significant downturn in the economy and obviously, there are signs that could happen, but unless we really faced that we think we would look at 2012 favorably.

VICL,Q2,2010,"In terms of TransVax’s progression to Phase 3, is that a study that you could start on your own or would that be partner dependent?","We would love to partner the European component of it because the study that we have done so far is in United States and unlike Provenge where there are differences in terms of treatment modalities between US and Europe. The transplant modalities or the treatment modalities between US and Europe are pretty identical, so doing a study in Europe would allow us to recruit the study faster, would also allow us to get after the European market and that’s what our focus is right now, is to see who we can rope in to help on the European segment of the study.

Can we do the study on our own. Right now, yes we can start the study, but obviously we need to raise more money to continue to study, but I think our efforts right now are focused on getting that CMV data out, particularly on TransVax to make sure the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed for our September hopefully at a important meeting release and then the Allovectin-7 data collection which is really a top priority, but don’t forget and TransVax right, now we are in the process of developing our Phase 3 trial design.

So you will see our locks available online through e-tail channels as well as brick and mortar stores in the spring. We missed the cycle to get in brick and mortar for the end of the year, so we’ll be in brick and mortar as we approach the first quarter. We also, as I described in my comments, set up our own e-commerce site. You can buy the locks directly from our e-shop by site or you can go to Amazon and purchase them. We did not want to miss the holiday season as well and be able to provide these products directly to consumers. Plus, this gives us a really good way to gauge the buying patterns. We've got a full product line, so which specific products, price ranges, all of our products are available in different colors and different form factors. So this is a way for us to gauge what consumers really want to purchase and so that's why we went ahead and set up our own venue to begin moving and selling locks just about two weeks ago.

TTC,Q3,2011,"In terms of the third quarter, can you kind of give us a sense for maybe what played out better than expected and what played out worse than expected. I guess, sales, year-to-date are up 12%; you’re holding it 10% to 12%, which implies maybe a little pressure in the fourth quarter. Receivables were up. Can you just walk through how the quarter played out, did you see strength towards the end of the quarter, where was the strength, where was the weakness during the quarter versus kind of your expectations 90 days ago?","Yes, I think, we would sum it up that as we talked to you in May, the macro factors, if you will, weather was relatively worse, the economy was relatively worse than we would have expected or hoped, if you will, and so that puts some pressure on all the businesses, it puts more pressure on if you will, the Residential business because those decisions are made real-time as opposed to get over to the golf end of the business, and those are more planned purchases, if you will, in golf. So, golf held up better. There is some relatively more pressure on the landscape contractor side and the most pressure on the Residential side. So, now we have a bit of an offset on the Residential side because while the spring and summer weather was not particularly favorable, the strong snow season we had last year and the early demand we're seeing for snow this year that pulled up some of that product. So, that goes on the positive side of the ledger, but snow can't make up for the total of walk power mowers and riders. And as I said on the remarks, while shipments are down on riders, retail year-to-date is ahead of the pace of last year on riders. So, that's a plus.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Over the next couple of years, at some point, it will, but I don't think -- I think K-12 will still be physical. And then what we've done on the supply chain for books was warehousing.

SXC,Q1,2014,"Is 8x now a good barometer for how we should think about future dropdowns? Just because I believe the initial plants you're dropping down were some of your better plants. So potentially, you may have been able to sell at slightly higher multiple. So I'm just trying to think about how you're shaping the future EBITDA multiples when you look at it? And then I have a follow-up.","Well, let's start with 8.3, which is the multiple here. Let's hold market conditions constant. Obviously, market conditions, whether in interest rates -- so let's hold market conditions constant for purposes of addressing your question. These are our best assets. But one of the -- a very important consideration for the multiple is the ratio of distributable cash flow to EBITDA, it's expressed in this 8.3 relative to EBITDA. Embedded in that is both the quality of assets, the amount of replacement capital, the amount of ongoing capital. But also what's interesting the financing that comes within the individual transactions. So as I think about 8.3, these are some of our newest assets, some of our better assets. If we were to put -- when we were to consider either Jewell or Indiana Harbor, we're going to have higher replacement capital accruals. We could very well have higher ongoing capital accrual, and so the ratio of distributable cash flow to EBITDA could be lower, so therefore the multiple would be lower. I guess, the last point I would make about this is that part of the transaction, obviously, is the GP. We're taking back roughly half the unit, so we maintain, even at part of this dropdown transaction, we're getting about half the equity issued back to us as LP units, and obviously, it's the GP, we're moving up the splits in getting the GP cash flow.

PM,Q3,2011,"It does help. And I guess the context is more really looking at 2012, because -- and part of that, I guess, depends on how much share you retain in Japan, because we'll be lapping some of the benefit you saw in Q2 as a result of this -- the disruption. But I guess your point is if you take the year-to-date number of 31.5% and if you sort of think about that 30% that you're seeing at the offtake trend, that would sort of be the comparable number just on -- in terms of on the volume side. And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison in 2012 is not as positive, I guess, depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan.","Exactly. I mean, the most important point, you just said it, well, what is going to be the tax and price situation going into 2012, which is very hard to predict now. I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year, because nobody expects a tax and price hike of the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the DPJ tax council has come out with a proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually, excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here. Even an exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter, in terms of price, because well, the central approval by the Finance Ministry of price increases is also still in place.

VNRX,Q1,2021,"It is on the line for Jason. So I would like to see if you can kind of give us just a bit of a deeper status update. And walk us through the steps that you need to take for the human diagnostic platforms. We know that the big study in blood cancer has kind of on pause, but what about the other programs like lung cancer and colorectal? Especially now that you have the same like, you got full enrollment on the National Taiwan studies?","Yes. So I guess the human studies, the London said that the reason we did the blood cancer first is just one assay, or maybe two assays got fantastic results. I mean, look in the bed space, we are high 80s or 90s AUC’s accuracies, which is quite remarkable for a very low cost, easy-to-use blood test. But obviously, in the lung and colorectal space, it is more work, because we have always needed to do a panel. And so you have to get a broader range of assays ready. And also, on a platform, that is not something you would use four or five different plates for. So it would have been very hard to do a beta launch in CRC, just on plates, because you need a wide range of essays. So that is actually we haven’t focused a lot of efforts on the back end of finalizing all because, we only have a relatively small team. The fantastic thing is our optionality now that we can pivot to the Vet space, where again, a very simple essay has got spectacular results, NETosis were very simple couple of assays, which we can launch very quickly and easily. I think if it hadn’t been for the pandemic, we would have spent a lot of time finalizing the platform for a broader range of assays, because to bring each assay to a product stage, obviously takes a lot of background work. It is not incredibly detailed work with a lot of detail. So you have to use, it can take six-months to 12-months per assay. I mean, you can do them concurrently but each one you can take a lot of work to just making sure they are fully robust and reproducible, which of course we have done in the assays which are now ready for products in the vet and the NETosis space. But we still need to go through that. But while they are still collecting and the process particularly, obviously, Taiwan’s not going to be the biggest markets. We are talking to a major player in Asia, I can’t mention the name but if I said it, who they are about assisting us with launching on a more simple platform in Asia, and one particular part of Asia. So we are just trying to work out now and how much effort we put into, because obviously, it is still going to take that that is low friction, that happens, but they are not U.S. regulatory trials. And they are probably not good enough for a country in Asia, they have accepted more proof of concept. But I think given how strongly that has taken off, and that could easily be a very, very large market, and so good to entice us with the platform we have ready, we still have to go through a bit of the background work to really finish off the lung and colorectal. So given the fact that it is paused in the U.S., and I think we would probably focus on getting the blood cancer in humans product out first, because that is very close to product ready, because it is a very simple panel, and to be 100% upfront, we have never got 90% AUC with one assay on local records always taking the panel, which is understandable, it is a solid tumor or liquid tumor, but so we do have to do quite a bit more work. I can run you through more of the details if you want to, after that. We still have more work to do on the background. So but I’m going to colorectal but given the optionality we thought we would go with where the very low hanging fruit is at the moment in the blood cancer and NETosis and the vet space.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
LBRANDS,Q2,2013,"It looks like you took the CapEx guidance up by about $50 million, so I was just curious what that related to, and then you also maintained your free cash flow guidance, so what the offset was there.","Sure. Thanks, Lorraine. The increase in CapEx versus the prior forecast relates to real estate and specifically, Victoria's Secret real estate. One aspect of it is some additional CapEx that will be on '13 books but relates to 2014 projects. The effect of that is greater this year than it normally is, but fundamentally, it's about real estate in Victoria's Secret. And again, we remain very bullish about those projects and the sales results we're getting and the profit results we're getting and the returns that we've generated for shareholders. So just some movement there. With respect to the free cash flow forecast, as you would imagine, there's a wide range of inputs there in terms of all the components of that and, again, remain comfortable with the broad range that we've given. As you appreciate, a lot of our cash is generated in the fourth quarter. And so there's a lot of moving parts there. But again, the business has very strong free cash flow properties, and there's a reasonable range of outcome there, but it will be a strong year for cash flow.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,0.0,2.0

First of all, the room night growth was fairly broad, and it was a combination of a bit more aggressive sales and marketing. I would say more conversion improvement, especially on the front of hotels.com. Since we have integrated the platforms last year, the team has been working pretty hard on conversion improvement, site improvement et cetera, and we're seeing some nice results there.

We do expect that in the second half of this year though we are going to absolutely leverage the investments that we have made so, not just in the market share win backs in Germany but also in fine tuning and optimizing that warehouse management system and driving higher levels of productivity and longer-term taking the cost equation down from there as well.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
HOME,Q4,2017,Its Dan Binder congratulations on a another great quarter and year. My question was around your comp store sales guidance for Q1 looks like you probably up against easier one and two year comparison what you just faced in Q4. And it’s below your full year guidance for this year. Just curious if that's just being prudent or is there something you’re seeing around weather or anything else?," Dan this is Judd, what I would tell you as I shared on the prepared remarks, our business was very strong all last year and Q4 certainly we saw and acceleration on a two-year stack perspective.
We had weather that actually benefited us earlier in the quarter in Q4. And we were prudent to know that we were up against an easier January the year before and we expected normal winter which we got a normal winter. We know that weather evens itself out sometimes you get good periods sometimes you get a challenging periods.
February was a little bit more challenging for us to be candid when you look at our footprint we have a disproportionate number of stores in Texas. And we saw heavier rains and a slower start to the patio season.
And then nor Easter has been hitting your neck at the woods have been helpful from that perspective, but what I can point to is first and foremost, when you don't have that weather we can direct rebound from a business perspective.
And overall, we feel really good about how we’re positioned, how we are positioned competitively, how the field is executing, our merchandising assortment and we know that it will even itself out over time. Some of that demand will move from Q1 into Q2.

And I think in this situation, we were starting to see a return to some of the economic positives that we'd experienced in the past. We were beginning to see margin improvement. We were beginning to see the situation from a total economy standpoint bottom out. Yet at the same time, no one was 100% pleased with the results.

And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens, and just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on quite frankly. And so, it’s not a space as it exists today that we are interested in, nor do we believe that customers in the long term would be interested in. It’s a segment we would choose not to play in. That said, we do look at the space and are interested to see our customers’ respond to it. People that want a small computer so to speak that does browsing and e-mail, might want to buy an iPod Touch or they might want to buy an iPhone. And so, we have other products to accomplish some of what people are buying netbooks for and so, in that particular way we play in an indirect basis. And then of course, if we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution, then we will do that and we have some interesting ideas in the space. The product pipeline is fantastic for the Mac. We are – as we look back over the last four plus years, 17 of the 18 quarters of the last four-and-a-half years, we’ve exceeded the market rate of growth. And to exceed in this horrendous economy, I think is quite an accomplishment, especially when you look at the – that these very low-priced netbooks that are – I think it’s a stretch to call it a personal computer, are really propping up the unit numbers from the industry as a whole.

I’m not sure what’s your keys, I mean I don’t know that it makes it difference to the consumers since they are paying. So it’s really just through an open distributor just sort of gets a charge less in this way, but more this way. And if you get to the same place, I guess you went through a lot to get, I’m not sure where since their business model already contains it. I think piracy is probably a different, but probably trade is important for us. I think you talked about something like authentication and there’s no question.

And obviously you got to be user-friendly, easy to sign-in and easy to use and somebody and then figure out overtime you close the holes and you get too better and more. So I think people ultimately, you got to deal with piracy and the like, but it's a very good experience to have fair price and people who will pay their pricing. But I'm not sure the piracy, which has that, I don't see that as part of that per device, because that really is depended on the infrastructure to lever things and the like.

WBA,Q4,2019,"James, that's super helpful. And then I guess my quick follow-up would be it sounds like this cost program we should expect to see a lot of it flow through to the bottom line as opposed to reinvestment, I guess that's the right way to think about that?","Yeah. It's an interesting question and that's why we won't be providing growth savings on the call, because I have a philosophy on this, which is the only thing that matters is what hits the bottom line. And you know, the circumstances of the company and it's – if you think about – if you save on a gross basis you're going to offset your inflation. And for a company this size, you can work it out. It's probably $250 million. And then, if you're growing your scripts at 3%, 4%, 5% that's another $100 million of incremental costs, because you have an incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts.So you can be quite easily – before you start the year, you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part. How do you offset inflation? And how do you offset the impact of volume growth? The second one as you've seen, we've taken a very strong stance on the investments. And I don't want that message to be lost. We're hitting the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments. And that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So, we quite hopefully put in the magnitude of the investments, we're actually spending this year. And it somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems in the U.S. and U.K. and the implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next three years, as we implement these systems, enormous. So these systems will pay for themselves.The second – the next call it third is on new digital capabilities. And then, the final piece is every time we do a pilot – and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 60, plus 70 – 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try these pilots. These are all fully funded. So that's – long answer to your short question was the overhead is to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step-change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer term, and then finally as part of the business model, where reimbursement is offset by [generic] [ph] procurement, savings, volume and SG&A and cost discipline.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

So it's difficult to sell on-prem equipment. So if you could just give us a little more color there. Thank you.","Yes. Sure, Tim. So to answer your broad question on enterprise sector, I think Arista's brand is very well recognized for data center. And with our 6,000-plus customers, we've got very good recognition there from a differentiated product. And we've already been very engaged with them.So, customers we’ve been engaged with, in fact, we had most recently in February, just a little before all the doors got shut down on us, we were engaged with over 100, 150 enterprise customers. And we had a global advisory and Arista innovate.So our intimacy with enterprise customers is very high, and we continue to do well with them with both existing and new projects. I think where we will be challenged in the enterprise and also in the campus is new prospects. We're not going to get enough face time with them.We're doing a lot of virtual webinars, virtual events, virtual ebCs, it's a virtual world we're certainly living in. But the level of contact for both, product capability conversation, relationship, partnership and in fact, even testing, for both new prospects and enterprise and campus will be challenging.

FISV,Q4,2010,"Jeff, looking at the 2% to 4% internal revenue growth guidance, what are kind of the one or two biggest swing factors, particularly get to the high end of that range?","Yes, I would say it's the biggest opportunity that exists today. And earlier in 2010, early in the year in '10 -- sorry, I was getting my year straight -- we had talked about the fact that there were some larger transactions that we were in pursuit of. Some of them we could announce publicly, and some of them we could not announce publicly. And one of those happen to be WestPac, and we announced that it was a large transaction. Well, during the year, we ended up winning the transactions we thought we would be able to win. We didn't announce them because they were not announceable, but these are transactions that will be implemented over time. And the constraints that we have are really around having to contend with resource constraints within these very large financial institutions. We have to effectively get into their development queues. And some of the projects that we are working on, to the extent they can be moved in earlier, would have upside into our numbers for 2011. So that's the upside. I think on the downside, to the extent that the economy itself begins to deteriorate down to levels below what we saw last year in 2010, I think that would create some downside in our numbers. Beyond that, I would say that on balance, we would say there's probably more opportunity in our numbers if the economy stays as strong as people are talking about it staying right now. But we just don't see any reason, Chris, to get ahead of ourselves. We feel like we've got a reputation of doing what you say you're going to do, and that's what we're focused on right now.

DELL,Q3,2011,"Joe, I think you had commented that the quarter was a bit more back-end loaded than usual. I would say given the prevailing economic uncertainty in Europe, that actually sounds a little counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that uncertainty would have heightened over the course of the quarter. So perhaps you can explain what you think happened in September that led to that statement. Is there any risk of pull forward from Q4 into Q3 perhaps you can allude to backlog? And then finally, related to that, if normal seasonality is kind of 12% to 15%, other than spending levels being a tick below normal, what other considerations should we be thinking about in building our models for Q4?","Yes, Tony, you got a lot in there as your questions usually do. Let me see if I can parse it up a bit. You talked about the order flow, and what I was -- the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick which usually doesn't happen. But -- so if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say, maybe we pulled in but we didn't. I mean, and we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sites, we had the fearless forecast and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we follow them, and those were the orders we got. So they just came later and we saw our customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels looking at -- levels within the organization looking at and purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to kind of -- signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. But also, it's clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing. So you always get this question, how do you -- how does this look to you compared to 2008? And I think it looks vastly different. And again, we're in considerably different shape because if you look at our product portfolio in 2008, since then, we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain -- or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We're on vSphere 3 going to vSphere 4 not vSphere 5. So we're -- we as a company are in a lot of situation, and customers, while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains and remain competitive. And it's really interesting, you watch the financials in the U.S., it was a little bit slower in the first half of this year and it was -- we watched it closely. But in the second -- in third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects come, can't be held back any longer, they're spending. So -- and I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there, some of the Eurozone banks are stronger in the first half than the second half. But again, these projects, they have -- everybody's got a worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States and -- so it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments, if I had one systemic where you will be that as governments are really stretched and they got to be. But again, there, we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing.

It cropped up at the expense of patients getting other choices for the treatment of cancer.

Now, all of that was shared and in, what it is doing with me right now is I am sort of putting together and amassing what may or may not be a campaign. If you remember Joe I had to get by the election to find out what was going to happen post-November.

Can you just walk us through kind of what you saw from customers as you progressed through last quarter and into the beginning of this quarter in terms of that up and down in forecast you mentioned?","Well, the biggest impact, as you know, 50% of our business is communication networks. So our wireless access product demand from some of our customers is kind of weak this quarter; that affected our forecast for this quarter. If you look at the demand for that product longer term, this is mainly 4G LTE type of projects. We believe there is a lot of momentum there and we expect that business to be fine. So again, as I said earlier, I think communication networks for us, we do expect it to be slightly up. It’s probably more difficult to forecast that at this time. On a positive side, we are involved in advanced new programs in that group. So enterprise computing and storage, I think we’ll continue to move that in a right direction. That’s really mainly driven by demand for our storage area. And I believe that we’ve been investing some good solutions there. The other group that we talk about is medical, defense, industrial, I think all those will be okay. Semiconductor, capital equipment, still weak for us. We are involved in – in that business we really focus in a new products. We believe it – new technology coming out, that we will have some positive momentum in 2013. The energy area that we are really working on, and this is both from our – really crosses all energy area. It’s a new area for us. We got some positive things there. So I think from a pure positioning, I believe that we are well-positioned, but again, from a demand itself, I will say the hardest one for me to forecast right now for our customer base will be the wireless access product, especially in the short term.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I mean all I would say is, as we have said in [indiscernible], we clearly got significant AT&T growth but also we have got significant growth with another top 10 client. And clearly, AT&T has been a significant driver, both in the quarter and in 2014.

What we've said previously is when we look at the amount of ETL that would be a good candidate to move off of our integrated data warehouses, what we're saying is it represented 4% to 8% of the total workload on Teradata could be impacted by that. So what we're saying is 20% to 40% of the work being done on our integrated data warehouses was ETL and 20% of that 20% to 40% of the ETL being done on our Teradata IDWs was a good candidate to move off.

The $80 million versus the $150 million is just reflective of where the cash was at the end of the year, so we actually had that $70 million loan back to the U.S. at the end of the year and -- or I should say, had $70 million, so it's just an incremental $80 million on top of that, so the $150 million is the $150 million, and the overall amount remains the near $500 million.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

The last iteration we had, we were projecting between 20% and 30% console category growth in the U.S. for next year, for 2014. The model's built from a number of different sources. It takes into account a lot of different variables. What I will say is that the limited amount of data that we have here because it hasn't been very long, is certainly positive and consistent with what our expectations are. At the time we built the model, we have projected a new console cycle that's slightly smaller than last one. We were being conservative to account for things like the effect that the Wii had in the last cycle, right? Just include things like handhelds and preowned and so on.

But generally, I'd just say, as the NAB has pointed out, that in the very, very few cases where there's been any kind of discontinuance of service, it's been 1 or 2 providers for the most part or 3 across, and that we don't believe that's an accident. As it relates to us in terms of risk mitigation, we have very strong stations that are very valuable to the consumers in our markets and like our situation relative to our value proposition. I don't know if Marci Ryvicker is on the call, but Wells Fargo put out a piece just a couple of months ago that talked about accurately so that, I think, in 2012 broadcasters will account for 35% of all of the viewing nationwide and yet 7% of the subscriber fees.

As you’ll recall, we had a price increase in the fourth quarter of last year so now we are going to be cycling that price increase in the fourth quarter and as well as you know, USA Today circulation has been impacted by the tremendous downturn in travel related and lodging related vacancy levels and just simple lack of traveling and that’s obviously an important component for USA Today but I would add that USA Today continues to be the number one newspaper in print circulation in the country. Our subscription levels were virtually flat in the quarter, despite obviously the impact on single copy and newsstand sales and hotel delivery as a result of the travel impact. And the good news is that we have maintained every single one of our hotel contracts throughout this recession and feel very good about how we are positioned. I will remind you that back after 9/11, our hotel distribution I think back then was off about 30%. And then from September of ’02 to September of ’08, I think our hotel distribution was up about -- a little more than 50%.

What I would say though is when you look at the first half of the year, we did invest. We had anticipated an economic turnaround. We invested in sales costs. We added additional resources. We invested behind marketing. We invested behind a number of areas. And at the end of the day, given the lack of an economic turnaround, obviously, that impacted our margins in the first half of the year.

TDC,Q1,2014,"Just a quick question. You mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks about some of the point solution companies and your large customers evaluating solutions from those type of vendors. As that evaluation continues to occur, I guess, the question for me is that, do you have all the product and technology you need to address demand from your top 50? And you sort of made a comment on the R&D spend that something could be inorganic here. And so could you just sort of review what you're looking at from a product portfolio, both organically and what you may be thinking about that you may need to add to the portfolio?","Aaron, we have the majority of the capability to provide analytics throughout the analytical ecosystem. There are different workloads and requirements and price points that we don't necessarily address them all today. We do have different point solutions that will be coming. Keep in mind, the average selling prices in this space are not large, but likely there's some -- we look forward to some upside here. There are some very specific things that are beyond analytics that are applications, if you will, that come to play. So we won't cover them all. But, by and large, the vast majority of all the analytics opportunities in customers today and over the next several years, we have those capabilities and we're going to add to them.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

If we're looking, I know it's not a completely linear relationship with where oil is, but is there some sort of lag in terms of like where you see a precipitous drop in oil prices to when those translate into a lower absolute level of orders? Is there any kind of relationship there?","Ned, I don't have any graphs or statistics to give that. Again, when we look at projects, they are typically three to fiveyear projects. I think a lot of our customers, and I don't want to speak for them, but I think they're going to look to see that this is a spike down and there's going to be a movement back up. I do believe that we have seen probably in the chemical area more of an immediate reaction in order input for what the chemical companies are seeing, because of who they supply their product to.

We have also said that our comps are going to be slightly negative to slightly positive for the full year for the total retail enterprise. I would tell you that our expectation is that Michigan over performs that .9% comps in fiscal ’15 and we think we can get better performance in the Michigan retail than last year’s .9%, yet we’re cautious about guiding anything different than slightly negative to slightly positive for the entire retail base.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Are we kind of looking for a slight improvement in things out there? And just trying to kind of gauge how you feel for this feeling about the world out there. And then thinking about the -- and then the second question is, as you think about the larger deals, can you talk a little bit about the perception you were seeing from your customer base around the new products, the new cloud products, OpenStack, et cetera?","Yes, I'll start a bit on that. I think we're not trying to make major macro calls. I would say this plan, which is bottom up region by region, is assuming kind of a continuing economic environment and kind of single-digit IT growth business we've been seeing. So there's not a lot of the call [ph] of an expectation of an improvement or a decline. It's pretty consistent. In terms of the large deals, we certainly are seeing the portfolio effect where the large deals have multiple products. I think 5 of the large deals had a RHEV component. We talked about more than that had Middleware components in it. So really new products are really new. I mean, an example, we have phenomenal lighthouse names using OpenShift, which is our PaaS on-premise. I think they're really, really thrilled with it. But frankly, it's a brand new product category. We don't know if that's going to be a massive category or a little category. So customers are seeing -- are really excited about it, but that's just too new to even think about how that could affect billings or revenue in the next 12 months.

I guess, any color you can give us on how that impacts your profitability or really how you monetize that move.","Sure. I think all of us who travel and all of us who stay in hotels understand that more and more consumers, when they're in hotels, are armed with smartphones or tablets or whatever devices, in addition to receiving the USA TODAY at their doorstep. And what we believe is that we need to be at the forefront of however consumers want to activate and access our content. And so as more consumers and hotels want to consume that content on their devices, we want to be there, and we want to follow those consumers. And so we've effectively done that in the Hilton situation. Now, as I've said before, those opportunities that we have in the Hilton Hotel rooms, which I think are in excess of 3,000 or 4,000 hotel rooms now, is not going to be in your circulation revenue, but we are paid to provide that portal and those -- some of those additional features of content. And then I think also what it helps us is that it's a pretty targeted audience, and we can show to advertisers and others that these folks are travelers and have certain demographics because they're in certain part of the Hilton Diamond members or whatever. So I think it's a combination of advertising, together with being paid to provide that portal service.

Thank you.","Let me take the first part and Chip can address the Clinton. As it relates to the manufacturing cost, the one item that Chip noted in his comments was in order where we had really tight deadlines and the work with the customers we had enforced, product where we normally wouldn’t.

SPTN,Q4,2014,"Just looking at the retail EBITDA margins year-over-year, and I know they’re not exactly comparable, I see that they’re up about 20 basis points, was this primarily due to the merger synergies and the store closures?","It was a little bit of both and it was also probably a little bit of how we’re working the segment numbers. When you look at how we’ve treated the profitability of retail in the past we had it pretty much as a standalone entity where we treated distribution as a full profit center. This year, and we’ve adjusted the history last year so it’s not much of a factor, we’ve kind of changed that now to where we put a lot of the profitability into the retail segment versus the distribution segment and so we’ve equaled that out. That shouldn’t change a lot year-over-year, but just so you have a better understanding how we’re doing it.

I seem to recall there could be a change there that potentially helps. And then just in Korea, obviously, good share gains there. But I just wanted to confirm that you're still pricing slightly below BAT and JT in that marketplace. I think they're pricing up earlier in the year. And then finally for me, just on cost saves. Obviously, you made the point on the presentation that you're confident of exceeding the current plans this year. I just wondered whether you can give us any kind of indications on what plans might be for next year in terms of whether more cost saving or similar levels of cost saving as you're achieving in 2011.","Okay, Brazil first. Yes, there is a new excise tax law there which should provide a more level playing field over time. It's not immediately. It is phased in over time and that system then would eliminate the -- I only can call it absurd difference in taxation linked to packaging, if the cigarette is in a box or in a soft pack. So yes, a level playing field is always something good for us and beneficial and fairer going forward. Moving over to Korea. As I have said before, I mean, the real challenge in Korea also is to find a multi-year tax plan and tax structure plan in that market, and that actually prevails for us over short-term profitability considerations. And the third one on cost savings. Well, we have had a one-year target, because that keeps an organization focused. You'll see that the focus has paid off. As we expect, it's too early to say for next year. But yes, there will be a target for next year as well. We will talk about that in February.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

We've got a couple of pieces going on here. Number one, we've got Newsquest, who will continue to benefit from some of the pricing that they've done as well at USA TODAY. They instituted some pricing actions on home delivery in July and on single copy at the beginning -- at the very end of September. So we'll have some benefit from those 2 pieces. But then we will have further cycled all of the ramp out of the all-access content subscription model. But I think we're looking at this more than just from a quarter-to-quarter basis.

You're not going to staff the store exactly the same as you would on a normal Wednesday, but you're going to staff to make sure the customer experience is appropriate when you're open for midnight. But then you start to think about the flow-through of the hundreds of people in line at a store to get a Grand Theft Auto and then the number of people that are in line at the store to get these launches that we're going through right now, and you really have a fantastic opportunity to leverage the cost structure.

As I mentioned earlier that riders for us all-in are comping positive, walkers are obviously comping negative, and that’s I think a sign, a bit more of the riders being a bit more of a planned purchase, and walkers being maybe a little more influenced by what’s going on weather-wise. And we see that, we look at this data by kind of usually [ph] US but across the US by region, and areas that have had more problematic weather comped negatively.

FISV,Q4,2010,"Just the bill pay outlook. Jeff, I know you and I talked about this before and I figured to ask it again, see if things have changed. Just wanted your thoughts on what lower debit interchange means for your bill pay outlook. Again, I think I could certainly argue it's positive and negative, but just wanted your thoughts on that.Yes, classic CheckFree bill pay, not the walk in or the other stuff, just bill pay and I guess on the tail of that, the e-bill as well. Just with the cost of taking debit being cheaper, could we see more Biller Direct? Or because you have more optionality now with debit, could you see it open up more billers to take it and it all being aggregated under the banks. I'm just trying to get a feel for how that shakes out because I'm still kind of confused by it.","No, I understand, and I think we're all working our way through the complexity of what will happen. At least from my standpoint, I'm still a firm believer in the aggregator model. And so whether debit creates another quasi form of payment, and especially if you can put a rewards umbrella around that and does that begin to help bill pay, I think you might begin to see some different economics. As different economic models emerge, I think you could see rewards end up centering around, not just transactions, but around bill pay and other kinds of services that aren't currently covered by that. So I think the Biller Direct is certainly going to be an option for people who like Biller Direct. But at the end of the day, I think the aggregator model wins. And I especially believe that mobile, as a way to allow people easier access kind of when they want that access, will actually accelerate trends towards aggregators. And as we talked about before, we do believe that bill payment follows bills, and the propagation of e-bill is getting that right. I actually think it begins to diminish the Biller Direct value proposition because you have the amounts and the other relevant information right at your fingertips. So kind of a long-winded way of saying we still believe in the aggregation model. We think Biller Direct is there to stay. We do a lot of that work, but we think that the aggregating model will win even in a period or a time of lower interchange. Depending on if that continues in that form, I guess, will also play a role in the ultimate decision. Well, thank you, everyone for joining.

I guess, what specifically can you do if indeed Durbin does disaggregate some of the volumes away from the bigger networks on PIN debit? What can you do specifically to try and capture some more point-of-sale volumes? Because that seems like the biggest way that you guys could actually and maybe make a dent in the industry if you can grab some more of those volumes.","I would say, John, over the last several years -- and when you were making that comment, it made me think we probably hadn't done a good job talking about this. We've actually spent a lot of energy and effort over the last few years in expanding our presence at point-of-sale. I think we're about a 98% or 99% acceptance at this point through the U.S. through our direct efforts and some partnerships that we formed. So we're out there.

So can you give a little bit of color on that?","Yeah. I’d love to, obviously, we think it’s a terrific equity. It’s a very, it’s a unique equity in that organic space sort of it’s an all family equity. Its mom’s buying organic products for herself and for her family and the kids, which is a very attractive positioning within the organic space. They’ve -- as you know, they’ve had consistent very strong growth and we think that the brand is very flexible and very expandable, giving that -- given that broad positioning and gatekeeper target. So we really like the positioning and the reason we bought it is because of that flexibility and the growth opportunity. There are also some sort of business model opportunities that I think will result from the combination of Annie's with General Mills. First of all, we just have more sales force capacity that we can bring to Annie's and that means that we are very confident that we can continue to increase the distribution of those brands and that’s a good opportunity for us. There are numerous margin expansion opportunities for -- with Annie's, everything, can from the sourcing and how ingredients are brought in to the logistics and how we reach customers, all of the other internal supply chain, HMM things. We think there are many opportunities here and we have actually jointly discussed these opportunities with Annie's management and they are quite excited by those opportunities. And then again, they will just be some cost savings that we can capture as a corporate entity, Annie's becomes part of General Mills.

And so the opportunity to work with people who I respect, who I think have a lot of passion for the business and serving their clients in a way that this management team seems to want to serve clients, was very attractive to me. I also believe that there is a lot of opportunity to think hard and look long and hard about how to be innovative and create new sources of revenue growth for this company.

","Yeah, so just give you a little bit more flavor around the letter of credit is that we repurchase the raw materials from one of our contract manufacturer in connection with a transition to a new contract manufacturer.

HOME,Q4,2017,"Lee, I just wanted to maybe take a step back and think about just the cadence of same-store sales here. You all have so many levers that you're pulling that seem to be really driving the business with nice mid and high single digit comps for six quarters right now. I guess as we think ahead here to 2018. Can you help me think about the dynamic of difficult comparisons versus the dynamic of so many things that seem to be building momentum for you?"," I would say we focused on all the levers of comp. So we start with traffic, we look at conversion. We look at units per transaction and average unit retail. We have initiatives against every single one of those and we've got champions in our executive team for each one of those for example and they’re cross-functional leaders.
Judd in fact runs the UPT initiatives. He focuses on how many more things can we get into a basket, works with merchandising and marketing and so on. Peter obviously works on conversion for example. Ashley, our Chief Marketing Officer who focuses on traffic, average unit retails run by Alyssa and they run across functional team.
We've got efforts against each one of those. There are still a lot of opportunity in each one of those. We’re going to continue to focus on that. As a result of our focus on that, the past five years we've been able to be very consistent in delivering same-store sales growth every quarter, 16 straight quarters averaging 5.6% comp.
You could say any of those become difficult compares while this the life of a retailer. And we're excited because we feel like there's still opportunity to drive same-store sales in every single box we have. So what we've got is energy against each one of those. For example, this coming year I would say our reinventions will continue to help drive our performance. That could be more units in the basket. It could be more average unit retail and so on.
It could even improve conversion because – people receive their new product in our marketing campaigns and want to come in at the store. Credit card and loyalty is in the early innings. We've mentioned that that should drive traffic in bigger basket. New marketing campaign that should drive traffic and our intent to buy when they come in and hopefully more adding into to build buy.
The value communication, hey we we're winning on price and the new TV campaign we just launched is the first time we've actually been showing prices on items across the whole campaign and our digital campaign really stresses price and the price value equation.
And honestly the style and message too about the multiple types of architects that we carry is bringing a broader customer base but really resonate with millennials. So I'm not concerned about the difficult compares. I'm really excited about this coming year. We've given guidance – for a positive same-store sales of 2.5 to 3.5 you’ve seen our performance over time and our expectations we’re going to continue to drive same-store sales every single quarter.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

So it's really difficult to speculate at this point in early days what the evolving position of the FTC will be. A couple of things that I would say is, number one, I do agree with you that business development is an important priority for us.
It has been for a while. And it will remain one of the priorities for deploying capital in our capital allocation strategy. The second thing that I like to say is that I actually feel that we've demonstrated over and over that when we acquire assets into the company, it's actually a way of accelerating their development and generating even more value for patients. And that's an important element of what drives our business development strategy.
I feel there are plenty of opportunities to continue to strengthen our portfolio across all of the areas where we have presence and expertise.

","Yeah, thanks, Andrew. And certainly, yes, we've heard the speculation around AdCom for potentially looking at it from a safety perspective for TYK2 inhibitors and whether they belong in the JAK. The way we think about it is as we have presented, if you look at the data, we do believe it is very differentiated. And there are absolutely good measures in terms of thinking around preclinical data, the clinical data, the mechanism of action and the way the data has evolved also on the efficacy side.
So overall, I think we have very strong arguments. If there is an AdCom, certainly, we'll be prepared with that with all the data that we've shared already. And we'll continue to evolve in terms of a long-term follow-up as well. We do believe this is new breakthrough in science. It's a new first-in-class molecule for a -- as a TYK2 inhibitor, potentially first as it brings new efficacy data for patients with psoriasis, which is an unmet medical need.

CTIC,Q4,2012,"Maybe just starting off with Pixuvri, Jim. Can you talk a little bit about the sales force that you have in place? Is it optimal for Europe? And if not, how to best leverage? Is it just increasing the sales force, how do you best leverage forces out there to maximize the potential of revenues in Europe for 2013? And then just related to the previous question regarding PFS, just help me -- just remind me, I thought OS was decided as a prime [indiscernible] will no longer be used for [indiscernible].","I'll toss it over to Steve [indiscernible]. We currently have 19 people in the field. That includes 5 sales people, a country manager and an MSL in Germany, with 2 additional, what we call, key account managers, coming into Germany in the second week of March. We have a field complement that covers the Nordics and the Netherlands. And then we have a field complement in the U.K. And obviously, we wouldn't put people into territories where we don't have big access pricing. With respect to is it enough critical mass, the answer is this product is very promotionally sensitive. Salespeople, unlike in the U.S., is the #4 source of information for physicians in Europe that influences their treatment practices, coming right behind like journal ads and symposia. So they play a very important role. These are very advanced degree individuals, typically Ph.D.'s, Pharm D's or M.D.'s in the case of MSLs. And we have seen that as we have [indiscernible] into the field complement, because as you may recall, what we talked about in the fourth quarter, while we may have hired these folks under German law, for example, they need a 90-day waiting period before they can start and we work that into our timeline. So a lot of these folks have started out of the gate, January 1, and again, with some of the complement coming on in early March. So the answer is we think we have the right [indiscernible] with total by the end of the first quarter in the field. It doesn't include the 3 leadership positions that we have in terms of the General Manager, market access folks, et cetera. So from that perspective, again, when we say it's promotionally sensitive, we see that directly in terms of call frequency and then orders that come in behind that. Just one other note to give you a sense in Germany. In Germany, there's a process whereby the hospitals, when they're interested in the product, they can apply to the payers' systems, have it put on what would essentially be like formulary here in the U.S. Of the 2,000 hospitals in Germany, we targeted only the top 200 where the majority of the lymphoma patients are treated. And of those 200 hospitals, after seeing just a one-sheet product profile for Pixuvri, 146 of them applied to the regulatory agencies for formulary requests. So we're encouraged, we think we have the right complement now. And as sales start to ramp up, and importantly, when we get pricing decisions, then obviously, we'll implement the second half of the year, the additional sales personnel to try to make this a successful launch.

HAE,Q4,2014,"Maybe to begin with Brian, just a little bit more comments around as you look into ‘16 and your comments around some of the pressures in the U.S. market for transfusions. I mean is anything out there that gives you confidence that that's -- when you will see the turnaround? How do you get around the calculus of getting into ‘16 and some of these pressures you have been seeing overall as it relates to transfusions in the U.S., sort of abating in that timeframe? And then a couple of follow-ups.","What gives me confidence there, Anthony, is that we’ve moved to protocols that are consistent with protocols practiced around transfusion triggers elsewhere around the globe. And that's what's driving these changes dramatic as it’s driving down into the low 30s per 1000 of population. So what gives me confidence, here the math works from 40, 10% decline last year, 10% decline this year, down into the low 30s, the math works. Do I expect that there’d be potentially some bouncing around in fiscal ’16? Yes, I do. We’ve contemplated that in the initial outlook that we've given to you. But I think we'll see more stabilization than not. Blood centers and hospitals are going to continue to remain focused on blood, it is still a very expensive and significant portion of their healthcare -- of their supply budget. But importantly it's also a cost driver, how they bring care to patients. We know clinically that the more halogenated blood you give a patient the higher the infection rates, the higher the length of stay. And so the question becomes, how the blood centers become more relevant in helping their blood center customers, not just buy a bag of blood for less price. So in other words, focusing on the cost of collection, but how do they help customers focus on the cost of transfusion, that’s $1100 of that versus a $200 of that and that involves collection, that involves the logistics of blood between the blood center and the hospitals and the logistics internally within the hospitals. And then it involves the practice of blood and there is significant opportunity there and that's what blood centers have begun to engage us in, really focused around how to take that cost out and that's where the opportunity lies, that’s the definition of blood management, that’s why we continue to stay very focused.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
DELL,Q3,2011,"Maybe to change the topic a little bit, if you could talk about storage virtualization, what you're seeing out there in the sense of this is starting to pick up from your standpoint and how do you view the competition versus the product that you have out there?","Well, let me say this. What we think as the most important aspect of storage is how you auto tier. And you can -- customers can store a string of information bits, bytes. You can do it in memory. You can do it in Flash technology. There's several different kinds of Flash technology. There's SLC. There's MLC. There's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K Fibre Channel drives. You got 10K Flash drives. You got huge 3-terabyte going to 4-terabyte SATA drives. So depending on where you store the data, you got tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the other tiers that are 1001 in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we used all those technologies. And then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again, actually produce drives -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing -- what moves the needle most in storage, I would tell you it's that. The storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays. And we have -- with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of -- some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position, and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

But how much pressure does that put on you for 3Q to really get prices in?","I would say the impact on Dover... first of all, not a lot of our companies are actually on FIFO or a little more on [ph] LIFO. So we don't have the same... the other way around... I am sorry. So we don't have as much of an impact as companies that are entirely on that system.

HSY,Q3,2020,"Michele, I like to follow up on the Reese's Snack Cake. You mentioned that it's small right now, but Hershey went down this path about 15 years ago, and it didn't really translate into anything material. So I'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now. Does this maybe mark a new phase over the snack section evolution and I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean does it compete against the Twinkie, the cookies? Just where is the target market? Any big picture of thoughts would be appreciated.","Yeah, absolutely. So I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a mass launch, where we just threw it out there and try to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time. But we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time, so that we could really learn about the proposition.
We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area and we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So this, for example, is very C-store focused.
It is a single serve type of item, so we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the snack cake market. So yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands.
We know that we had participated in this category for many years through licensing and we learned through that that our brands could participate and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend and our confection item skew more to afternoon and evening.
So this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth, because that is where these snack cakes get utilized. So again, we're going to have a very focused rollout and we'll put it in locations, where we think we can garner incremental space and where we think there is a strong consumer fit and starting at C-store and looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform well, we will expand. But we will watch it closely and take a measured approach.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Michele, a bigger picture question. Hershey took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal candies in 2018 and then in 2019. Given the negative impacts to Halloween for the entire category, would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions, maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or sometime later, until we get a normal consumer environment? Essentially, I'm just asking you to assess your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions. It's a weird environment and I don't know how it's altered that calculus. Thank you.","Yeah. So obviously, I can't speak to any specifics about our specific -- any upcoming specific pricing actions. What I can say is there has been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller more frequent increases. And that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time. We did, for example, actually have a small price increase this past year on our foodservice business in the third quarter.
So if we look over time, we have been able to price at various times at various economic conditions. So what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm. But as we've talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers, distribution, velocity, innovation, price, etc.
So we know that that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we have not yet priced and I think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time, the magnitude of pricing in '21 would be less than we've seen in prior years, at least at this point.
We've been pleased that we've seen conversion to be pretty good this year, even in a very difficult economic environment and I think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years, which is -- the category is very resilient, our brands are strong, we continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power.",0.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
ODP,Q3,2010,"Mike, as a follow-up on the expense side. On advertising, you drove sales. You drove gross margin dollars here in the third quarter with back-to-school. It sounds like in the fourth quarter, you're looking at advertising again and really causing your operating profit rate to be flat. Could you maybe quantify what the step up in advertising was in the third or fourth quarter? And how are you thinking about advertising, I guess, more holistically, is this now part of building the brand so there's some upfront costs, and you assume it to pay off later? Or do you expect a more immediate term pay off?","I think, maybe the place to begin is our customers have choices, not only in the OSS space but across the broader retail chain. We have underspent in marketing and advertising as a company, really since the depths of the economic recession hit Office Depot. During that time though, I think what would be important to point out is we've made significant investments in our business. We have improved our private brand penetration. We significantly improved the products that we domestically or globally source and bring in to provide great value for our customers in the store. We've invested in Copy & Print Depot. We've invested in Tech Depot Services. We've priced our assortments so that we're competitive, not only within the OSS channel, but across retail, in general, for highly visible items. And we've reduced our supply chain from 33 facilities down to 16. But given the fact, our customers have choices, and we've got a great story to tell our customers about the changes that have taken place at Office Depot, not only to drive brand awareness, but also to drive traffic and customer loyalty. We felt it's time to tell that message, and one of the marketing levers that we have to tell is through broadcast media, and typically, that's the broadest lever that we have. Overtime, we may change the mix of how we choose the market, but I think the one thing that we won't change is the recognition that we need to do a better job of creating brand awareness. We needed to do a better job of marketing our company. So to the point earlier, I would say our issue at least with the North American Retail is lots of about marketing. It's from an operating margin standpoint, it's our store base. We have an aging store base, and we have a store base that's larger than it needs to be on average. We have a plan to address both. By addressing that over the next three years, we think we can rightsize our store base. We'll continue to advertise our company. And we should talk less about advertising expense at that point and talking more about how we're growing the business, that's certainly our plan.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

As we go forward, we're looking probably -- we've just finished our strategic plan. We're looking at CapEx probably consistent with DNA, in the $210 million to $220 million range. We talked earlier in the discussion about touching our old format stores. We want to take 400 old format stores and put them in the new M format. That will be a significant CapEx driver, going forward. And we're also looking at a common systems platform for Europe, going forward. So those will be two things that we're looking at that'll drive the business. And given where we are, with liquidity, cash flow -- I'm particularly pleased with the third quarter cash flow.

TTC,Q3,2011,"Mike, could the Asian demand, I heard your comments as it related to Japan, but I believe you indicated Chinese and Korean markets were moderating, is that temporary in nature or do you see that the start of a more secular trend in those two markets?","Well, here’s how I would answer that. There certainly has, and this is not the first time it’s happened in China where golf growth was building some momentum and then in different times the Chinese government gets involved and may slow things down. But we started from the position that there are approximately 500 golf courses in China for 1.3 billion people and there are 16,000 in the US for 300 million people, and so while we want to do the extrapolation madness, I think that would extrapolate to 69,000. It’s fair to say that long into the future there will be likely golf growth in China. As well as some of the other parts of Asia, Korea is a solid golf market we expect that to continue for the next few years. I was talking with some of our international folks just earlier and even in some other parts of Southeast Asia, Thailand and Vietnam we continue to see some positive signs. So Asia golf will continue to be a growth driver for us we believe, and then as I said Japan will recover next year and that’s significant as there is, I don’t have the number here in front of me, but there is 2,000 or 3,000 golf courses in Japan, and they really did not surprisingly, because of the tsunami they did pullback and we would expect that recovery and they continue to cut the golf courses, so we expect that recovery in 2012.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

We do have a lot of tailwinds, as I said in my prepared remarks, around our services business and other parts of the business.

And we expect -- as the manufacturing economy is strong, we expect that to pretty much continue, although 60% of our funnel is cloud, so we expect to continue to have strong bookings on the cloud.

So it's not just that you have people writing less checks, but you have many more people converting those paper checks, specifically at merchant, like converting paper checks to electronic or whatever the case maybe. And so you have not just less checks, but you have less paper overall in the system. And that's really a function of all of the capture, the remote capture, and things like that, that have been moved in the system over the last few years.

UIS,Q1,2019,My first question is what when can we see the margins of the large products that you've taken on start to normalize and start to be accretive instead of to dilutive to your Service margin profile?,"That's a great question. I would say, one, these are staggering, right? So these new comp - contracts are coming in over time. The first ones really came in very, very late in 2017. They came in throughout 2018, as you can see from our contracts, this quarter, we signed almost $990 million of new stuff this quarter. So one way to look at this and I think a more effective way is actually looking at it in that staggered way based of when the contract is signed. Often you will have contracts that in the first 12 months are frankly dilutive. They don't add anything to profitability. And then sometime in the 12 to 15 to 24 months they get more and more profitable. You would expect to close to profitable run rate by 24 months. And that's not scientific for every one of these. But you'd expect two years into this to be operating close to what you would expect to see at least as an average profitability over the term. And then, toward the end of the term, it would go above average. But that would counterbalance the below average in the beginning. So it's really more of a contract by contract approach rather than it is for - to look at the whole thing as a blob. Now, that is ameliorated in the U.S. Federal market, where you don't have as much of a negative in the front or as much of a positive in the back. The U.S. Federal profitability has some variability, but not nearly the amount we see in the non-U.S. work. Mike?",1.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,1.0

It's really a matter of time and it's contract specific. And some implementations are more complex than others and the size of each deal has an impact on that as well. So as we noted in our prepared remarks that we think that we'll see some modest recovery throughout the year, in expansion of our margin.

HOME,Q4,2017,My other question was around new store productivity that’s been looking great. Do you think that’s a function of just better quality real estate selection and availability or do you think it's just a broader base strength that you’re seeing for the whole chain in marketing and merchandising?," And I will cover this together. The last four years we’ve seen improving sales and returns each year for the store portfolios the new store portfolio. And as we’ve gotten bigger we’ve gotten stronger which we’re really excited to say, and I would tell you it’s a function of a number of things.
One is we’re better at executing at the store level so making sure we got the right inventory to the set up the store, making sure that we set it up well, making sure we set it up for the expected demand at the location and so on. We’re better at marketing, much better grand opening and also continue to sustain the demand in a new market.
Also I would say from a real state standpoint, they’re better location. So we become a stronger retailer where we have watched scale. We’ve got more things to look at and I would tell that allows us to be more picky. So we can – when you do that you can be more picky get better locations with same or better terms as well.
And now what I like even more is we have a deeper pipeline than we've ever seen, and with the deeper pipeline you can be more selective, you can go to vibrant retail modes. You can get better quality, you can look further out, you can be thoughtful about cannibalization and that can help you be sensitive about that in timing and quarters and by years.
And so I would say I’m super pleased with our overall. The last thing I would say as we continue to be better on the analytical side as well. We’re on the third generation of our model. Our [bucks-in] model we're informing that more than ever with the data that we have in our performance with better data stats we’re investing in set model.
We’re actually using some new science around that to help be even more selective and understand demand not just in the market, but how people travel to shopping nodes. And so as we’ve done that we've seen stronger performance as the new store opens up.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,1.0

One of the things that we're looking forward to in this fall season is how do we make sure that we are invested within the bra launches that have tested well and do we have enough inventory and can we be in stock, and I think the check mark to that is yes. I believe this year as well, we are making investments in certain key items, that we know that we have left business on the table, we have -- still have lots of open to buy.

And so, I want to get a sense of just when you think about that 6% on manufactured products volume, you're putting in a lot of investment organically you've bolted on with these couple of plants. How are you thinking about within your guidance potential for reacceleration? Or just what level of growth in volumes should we be thinking about for manufactured products going forward?","Yes, that's a tough forecast. I mean, obviously, you're going to have correlation with starts. We've talked about that single-family starts over the long-term with the best indicator of our underlying demand-. We do think we're taking shares so obviously that's another component and this is part of our ability to do that, because we think the macro trend is coming towards Builders FirstSource as it pertains to our ability to invest in our skill set in that truss manufacturing. Or I would say that maybe the best answer to your question?

With that comes some maturing, if you will, just the way you manage our strategic account relationships and everything. So he is very much involved in bringing some of those methodologies and techniques, certainly working with the team and giving him the coaching and assisting and their own competency assessment and he is working with the operations team to just try and make some adjustments as he sees fit. But it's a structure that we have launched and Drew was just a good piece of the puzzle to go in and help us execute it. And he is very familiar with it, as you are alluding to and we really just think it's going to make the execution much, much better. But it takes a little bit of time.

And we feel pretty good about that, having mid-teens revenue in the data center, combined server, and data center GPU on revenue of $2.1 billion. As far as opex is concerned, you know, our guide for the year is about 28% of the revenue guide that we provided. And you are right, fundamentally, the investments are, you know, R&D and go to market, and obviously, the business is growing.

TDC,Q1,2014,"No. I think it's a good starting point. I guess it's a process that we all have to go through. The other quick question, like last year, Asia was kind of a little bit of an issue, more macro related. I saw it coming back in Q1 a little bit with 4% constant currency. Can you talk a little bit about the trends there?","Yes. In international, first of all, the one thing I want to point out is the EMEA side, and you saw the results, they were up 10% and 8% in constant currency. So that part of the business is performing okay. There's always room for improvement. On the Asia side, basically, what you saw in the numbers is Japan remains a headwind. We're making improvements there and Japan did grow a little bit in constant currency in the first quarter. And Japan made improvements last year, but it's such a big part of the revenue in Asia-Pacific, if we don't have that growing meaningfully, it's hard for Asia-Pacific, in aggregate, to grow. China was flattish in the first quarter, but I would call it just more of a timing thing. And then outside of Japan and China, South Pacific and Southeast Asia in constant currency grew double digits, and by that, I don't mean low-double digits, it was more in the high teens and 20.

I think we won't probably do a deal this size this year. I think we're looking at the process of sort of integrating the Sargent activities with the RBC activities and getting the accounting homogenized with RBC's accounting and getting our sales and marketing people lined up and working on improving their execution and margin expansion.

In terms of the capacity additions by our competition, we believe only one of our competitors is adding capacity in Korea, and we believe even that is at a very moderate pace.

I mean, I think that the challenges that we face with our suppliers, and it's clearly getting a lot better. I mean, David has known these folks at the top levels, I know them. There's been trust that's been developed over years that predate the last year, here at Univar. And having worked with him in the past and seeing how we do things, they're really opening up their eyes and the opportunities for us. The biggest challenge, to kind of answer your question -- so that's just a little color around it, but to answer your question, the biggest challenge we've had is just -- they want us to have the right kind of marketplace behaviors, they want us to go get new business and grow, and hang on to the business that we have. And they also don't want to see antagonistic relationships, where we have multiple suppliers of the same product that have to compete through our channel. So we're working on all of those things at a really brisk pace. I think the biggest thing that we can do for our supplier partners is to execute better in our sales force. And that's the drum that I've been pounding since I took this job day-one. We're getting better, but there's a lot of work to do yet. This is a culture change. It involves changing how you reward people, how you recognize people, who you hire, how you train them, how you motivate them. And that's the biggest challenge that we have. And I will tell you that we're seeing very good successes in Europe, and in Canada, and we're seeing tremendous progress in the U.S., but trust like that takes time to develop, and we're nurturing the relationship, we're getting new shots at things.

I guess maybe following up on a comment you made earlier about Asia Pac and the double-digit decline that you saw in China and Japan; can you give us any color on the verticals where you really saw weakness?","Just a couple of points to add to that. We did have an increase in our backlog situation in China during the first quarter compared to the quarter the year before for about -- on our legacy business is about $4 million or $5 million. And if we were able to ship that, we would have had a flat kind of number there. We are, as Pat mentioned earlier, putting in place a warehouse there and stocking of that warehouse, we believe, will help our growth prospects. A little bit of disruption on the supply chain to that warehouse in the first quarter with the West Coast strike. So again, our team in Asia is expecting to have growth in the second quarter.

The economy over there still has a lot of activity, so it's not like it looks like its dead, but there was a lot of capacity put in place. So I think that's just going to be a little bit challenging here, as it really has been, for them to use up that capacity with more production before they really need to start putting more CapEx in place. Automotive sales over there are still okay, but they did build capacity to build a lot of vehicles. So we got to watch that. And ship building and aluminum profiles. And aluminum profiles are a big business for us and our powder business in China. And that is making trim and things that are used in the construction market. So as we see some domestic construction slowdown due to the big build in. In China that business is impacted as well. So yes, I think we just have to have a little bit of patience there.

So, Lowell, during your tenure as CEO, you've really -- Verizon's really stuck to its core competency of a wireless network leadership, while other companies have moved to diversifying to adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment and adoption, do you believe that Verizon can sort of widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers? Thanks.

And we've looked at the things that we've done. Network leadership is at the core. It's part of the values of the company. Every individual here is proud of what we do, our network leadership.
And we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm the proudest of, it's the things that you've mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G is -- are some of those.

But nobody knows this space better than Bristol-Myers Squibb, given your experience with products. Thanks.
","Thank you, Giovanni. And certainly, very excited to see the data coming out, great for the patients and certainly very happy with where we're going in the pipeline for LAG-3 in oncology for BMS as well. Overall, the natural progression after seeing the data in the first-line setting of addition of relatlimab on top of Opdivo would be to go into the adjuvant setting. And that's where you're beginning to hear a lot more that we'll be progressing into a Phase 3 program in the adjuvant setting for this co-formulation that we now have as a fixed-dose combination for Opdivo plus relatlimab.
Certainly more to follow as we look deeper into the data for the metastatic trial, to gain more in-depth knowledge on the biomarkers, as well as the long-term follow-up that will come from the current 047 trial that will continue to evolve in terms of our knowledge. Now the second part, which you asked, is about the non-small cell lung cancer opportunity. Certainly, excited to have started the early POC generation trial, as well as looking at the combination of nivo plus relatlimab plus chemotherapy to see where we can take it. And that's the idea behind accelerating the enrollment in that trial so that by the end of the year, we can initiate a Phase 3 program in that setting if we have tolerability that is demonstrated in that early trial that we're looking at.
In addition to that, we will continue to hear evolution of the data potentially into hepatocellular carcinoma that we are looking also to have some look into in the Phase 2 study. And that can open up additional indications as we look forward. Beyond that, in the SSP trial, yes, we are still looking forward to the readout in the early part of 2022. As I said earlier, there are two opportunities.
Opportunity number one is to improve on the current anti-coagulation paradigm with a single agent. And then, opportunity number two is to expand the use of anticoagulants with a background therapy of anti-platelet agents. And those are the two studies that together will form the basis of the clinical development plan that we are thinking through, whether it be the venous side or the arterial side of thrombosis.

BKYI,Q3,2017,"Oh, that could be my assumption, I assume that or something. What were the maintenance contacts that were lost and what were the reasons.","Just attrition. We have attrition and we've had attrition through the years. We’ll have customers that will just no longer decide to pay maintenance because they really haven't had any maintenance issues quite frankly. Some of our OEM customers in particular that do not change bills that do not update because it's embedded in a device or in a particular product that almost like firmware that doesn't change will decide not to pay maintenance and it just really natural turnover and that's what we experienced. Some of it also is, as we move to SaaS, as you know, the line maintenance line will decrease as well just naturally over time. But there were no -- nothing material in the context of something to be alarmed about or anything that was unnatural.

Maybe this takes a little longer than that. It all depends, obviously, on the POS which is the adamant economy in a way but I would say, if you ask me, I think the quarter for sure as we also guide to, this triggers our guidance will be impacted by inventory reduction and distribution, I would suspect you will see something also feeling quarter one.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

Is that going to be a significant revenue generator for you, or is that sort of a fitting the door into that region?","I think its wait and see right now. The difficulties of the Asia Pacific market is the geographic expanse. One vessel can’t cover everything so you have to sort of pick a place where you’re going to operate. There has been tonnage added to the region over the past years so it’s in a bit of an oversupply situation right now. So initially here it is establishing a presence but our forecast does – the vessel is probably more capable than anything else down there and we do have a multiple service lines that can be deployed off the vessel. So we’re hoping that we can overcome the difficulties, the geographic expanse by having multiple sources of utilization.

We stayed within those norms of ranges again, peripherals being 40% to 45% of our business. Peripherals grew slightly less than our overall company rate and then the other three categories of systems, software, and networking all grew just slightly more.

So we're seeing a lot of activity there and we able to integrate these businesses very quickly within three months. The company operates as a single company. So from an operational perspective, integrating another $2 million to $5 million business would not be a problem at all.That said, we want to establish a couple of quarters of showing bottom-line results. We think that that's going to be meaningful to investors. So our primary focus is operations right now is more of an opportunistic review of incoming acquisitions.

IM,Q2,2007,"Okay and then Kevin I also wanted to ask you, your commentary on the U.S. this quarter was... it sounded a little bit different than last quarter. I think on last quarter's call you talked about U.S. demand being weak early in the quarter or North American demand but then rebounding during the month of March. It sounds like demand may have slackened again at some point in the June quarter. Can you help us understand what Q2 was like in North America relative to Q1 and which parts of the business got better or worse, and sort of what the linearity of the quarter looked like?","Yeah, on the linearity question I guess it is a little bit more difficult to answer because we do have our own linearity just based on our own calendar of our quarter itself. But really I think what we saw in the second quarter that perhaps may have created some softness relative to Q1 was in the government area and then continued softness in the corporate marketplace.

As a team we've been making some investments in the acquisition front that are going to I think favorably work for us, clearly bringing better margins into the portfolio, it has been something that we've can conscientiously investing in over the last year or two to counter balance if you may the ongoing pressures in what I call the volume of commodity side of the portfolio. But that also brings with it to some extent some incremental cost because those are higher margins and usually slightly higher cost to build those revenues into the company. So I think those will be factors that will help us in the back half of the year and I think overall just improvements in our performance that we have got some of the first half of your challenges out of our way. We really do feel that most of the challenges that we were managing through Q3 or Q4 of last year going into the first half of this year are out of our way. So while the market is always interesting we have got most of the internal challenges out of our way right now which is good for us.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HLX,Q2,2010,"Okay and then help me to understand a little bit the expectation that this could be a beneficial, I don’t know beneficial, but the fact that the well intervention vessels could see a better overall setup from this because, I’ve always historically thought of the sort of rate that a well intervention vessel could get was somewhat determined by the day rates on a deep-water rig. That’s your well intervention competitor, if we got an oversupply even if temporary of deep-water rigs, they can’t operate in a drilling mode and clearly we’ve seen some deterioration in day rates for those units. How does that, help me understand how it works out as beneficial for the well intervention fleet?","Well so far the Q4000 for the work that it does is the lot more efficient than the drill rate. We’ve seen that just on our own number 3 well on Noonan, we were looking around for rigs just recently to go out and do the water shut off work since the Q4000 booked up and it’s just not commercial to do so without the Q4000, because of the efficiency gains. The clients have expressed us so far that they’re just holding their programs and they’re going to wait for us which is a very positive sign and I think the MMS the – I just got a work today that it looks the ruling is going to come down to lease extensions are going to be extended for a duration equal to this moratorium which would be a positive for everybody.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
IM,Q2,2007,"Okay and then just finally when you talk about weakness in corporate, is that primarily large corporate, same as you saw last quarter or have you seen some weakening in the small to mid size business area in June as well?","It's primarily large corporate. This small to mid size business I think is doing relatively well. The growth is going to change quarter-to-quarter, it still continues to be one of the strongest segments that we have. I do believe though that as we continue to implement or not to implement as we continue to move down the path of our new infrastructure technology division, that's going to help to spur growth for us in particular in more of that corporate space with the higher end products serving there as-well-as being able to serve the SMB markets to.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
IM,Q2,2007,"Okay and then just the follow up. Greg maybe just some qualitative commentary from you on what... where you think the demand in Europe is coming from, just kind of a currency driven phenomenon going on, was there some investment that is now getting caught up that wasn't being made over the past several quarters in the region. Just kind of why you think this demand is now starting to firm up a little bit over there?","That's a good question and it's interesting because about 3.5, 4 years ago we saw pretty good movement of the Euro versus the Dollar and that provided a bit of a catalyst. I think that there is some tailwind in the marketplace in Europe because of the currency situation. It's very hard to measure and know for sure but most components and products are US denominated in terms of cost level and clearly that means for a less or a lower priced Euro base product once it gets sold into that region. So I suspect that's helping, but I wouldn't have any tangible hard numbers to give to you, but we are seeing really in the last month or two some pretty positive signals from the demand and our own progress in most of the countries in Europe.
I think also you are getting a situation where Europe is seeing some real growth and a lot of people aren't seeing this yet, but we are hearing a lot of it. As a result of selling and servicing Eastern Europe much like the emerging markets of Asia, the 6 to 8 new countries of Central Europe and Russia are feeding an interesting new business opportunity in growth out of the supplying countries, which is Western Europe. And so there is an export phenomena, and as a result infrastructure spend to support a new business coming out of Eastern-Central Europe is I think helping Western Europe right now.
So I think those are the two kind of macro level factors that seem to be providing. What we see on a day-to-day basis, a more positive outlook right now than where we were three, four months ago.

Are you aiming for if conditions remain at these levels all year; you’re cash flow neutral or what is the ultimate goal, so we have really some sense on how to model this?","Yes, you can’t get to cash flow neutral instantly, but that would certainly be our goal over the years, to move in that direction and to give our revenues from new products a chance to catch up and exceed our expenses. We can’t give you an expense number exactly because we’re working on it and we just don’t want to get ahead of ourselves, but we’re going to be aggressive about it.

We think that we can attract a significant number of food customers throughout calendar 2019. We've got a number of large engagements that had begun deploying. In some cases food, especially QSR restaurants has a franchise model so that can introduce friction in terms of how fast and how large an implementation can get. But with the constant drumbeat of recalls and food bone illnesses and the amount of press, there has never been more interest in companies getting a hold of their operations, getting a hold of their product safety and making sure that they have done what they can to deliver safe and effective service and products to the customer.

I think there were some macro-indications last quarter that there was going to be overall improvement in the market. Some of those indicators have moved sideways or slipped a little bit. But the one thing we’ve consistently said and that I think we would repeat this quarter is that we are not seeing the recovery in the hospital business yet and that’s still the case.

We – I’m not going to make comments on fiscal ‘10. I think the important part is as you look forward, it’s just to understand that we are very, very focused on delivering extraordinary products to our customers and we’re going to provide them ever increasing value and we just don’t want you to count on the gross margins that you’ve recently seen which have benefited from just a tremendous commodity and component environment.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then I noticed in like the segment breakdown, it looks like other income was $5 million favorable comparison versus last year, like $16.7 million versus $21.4 million, and I was just wondering what the drivers were in that line item and why it was down?","Hi Rob, this is Blake, I’ll answer that question for you. So, as we looked at last year at this time, obviously our sales [ph] were accelerating at that time, so, the incentive expense was kind of little bit more back-loaded last year as we continued to do much better than we expected. This year, we’re not doing as well compared to our plan levels, so the levels of those payouts will be lower and kind of trending the other way kind of the back half of the year. So, the biggest portion of that was the incentive expense is lower than it was a year ago, and a good chunk of that expense is recorded in the other segment. A couple of things were kind of in there. We had some one-time items for product liability last year, which didn’t repeat itself this year plus our distribution profitability is recorded in that line and this year we have one more distribution company that we own and both of our two companies are doing better than they were last year. And also our Red Iron investment is in that line, and as it gets into the second year of operations full level of profitability compared to kind of startup mode last year that business is also doing better than last year.

This quarter very strong performance in the solutions business you know what was the mix of hardware versus recurring in this quarter, was the strong performance a function at big pharma customer you announced last quarter and if so kind of how what is the I guess timeframe on completing that roll out?","Yes. So, we had over 50% of the solutions revenue was driven by one-time implementation whether it’s professional services or the equipment itself and so that also had an impact on the overall gross margins. We are still seeing and have confidence in really high gross margin on the recurring side. We do expect a significant amount of net adds this current quarter as well, there is a portion of it that’s driven by large national retail chain, but were also having success in transportation and in healthcare as well.

Can you give a little more color on the duration of the work that it’s going to have down there and if there’s other follow-on opportunities that could keep it there? And then just curious on the broader marine I understand, sort of the pressure on the pipelay side and what could transpire coming off the moratorium. Owen, you’ve previously talked about your revenue potential on your existing marine asset base being about $1 billion, obviously giving consideration to a sluggish Gulf and maybe to Intrepid doing P&A light well intervention work, but is that still a reasonable opportunity set given what you see in your prospect queue obviously taking into consideration the potential for a little sluggishness there on the pipelay side?"," Okay, a lot of issues there but yes, I don’t think that our outlook is materially changed from anything that we said before. I’m pretty confident about the, I guess the Intrepid being our third pipelay vessel is the one that I would have the most concerned with but she is on her way down to Trinidad. I believe she is down there for at least two months and there is additional work that clients in Trinidad are talking to us about that could extend to stay. So that’s a very positive move.
The Caesar is out on its first pipelay job right now and like with all vessels, the work is going pretty slow as we train the crews and get the equipment functioning properly and everything so I don’t expect a great contribution from her. But then she right after this, she also heads to Trinidad. So Trinidad is becoming a very good market for us and an alternative to the US, Gulf of Mexico. We’re also bidding work in Mexico and Brazil for primarily the Caesar. And that would open up the Intrepid to return sometime in the fourth quarter to pursue both pipelay but we really have been very successful with her this year, working her as a multi service vessel in the construction mode.
And I see that kind of a mix continuing. I think actually the construction mode is – given the performance of pipelay and the margins available in the current market I actually see the alternative uses of the Intrepid probably being a little strong margin than if we left her solely in the pipelay mode for next year.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Or are people, you’re going to get some cancellations there or do you think that some of that continues to get extended?","Jim, let me take that. Yes, the Q4000 was fully booked for BP Macondo throughout 2010 and somewhat into 2011. And for the most part its involvement in the Macondo situation is only extending that backlog and increasing the backlog. There has been a job, a small job that was cancelled but aside from that mainly the work that she had in backlog has just been pushed to the right. So it’s been a fairly positive for us in terms of actually building backlog.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TAP,Q3,2008,"Okay, There is obviously an issue with the way the Canadian dollar has performed over the last month or so. I have two questions in that regard. If we assume, for illustration purposes, that your currency neutral profits are flat next year, operating income flat, what is structurally there? Let’s say for illustration the Canadian dollar is down 15% year-on-year versus the US dollar next year on average, what is structurally in place to cause that scenario to not produce a 15% US dollar profit decline? Have you done anything hedgewise that might add to any structural protections you have? That’s a translation to US dollar profit question. I’m going to turn that over to Stewart, if that’s okay with you.","Yeah, let me address this. As we’ve covered in previous quarters, we really don’t get into the details or the specifics of our hedging. I can point, however, to the fact that there is an important moderating factor which is the fact that we have a substantial amount of our long-term debt denominated in Canadian dollars. That presents a natural hedge for us.",2.0,0.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

VSH,Q3,2011,"Okay, and just lastly on your current production levels, I know you’re working to bring inventory down. So do you plan to bring production level s down in both businesses in Q4?","We always adapt to the need. Vishay as you know is quite proud to be a relatively – I would say a very reliable supplier of free cash, the major element of that, is of course, not to let inventory to get out of hand. And we have demonstrated that in the past, we will adapt our levels. And honestly, we are relatively experienced than that, and this is what we do at the moment. But what I try to say before is – my ambition is, not to lose, strain, workforce, so we will use all other tools which we have like short working pass, so Euro like plant shutdowns, et cetera, just to adapt the volume of production, but not really inventory, in fact reducing inventory further, but not lose the workforce.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
IM,Q2,2007,"Okay, and just lastly regarding Asia, do you still have a strong presence in the components, and processors, and other PC components, and how is that business doing?","We do. It's doing well in probably the countries like China and India where there is still a fairly large wide box market, but I would say more of our growth is coming from finished systems whether that's laptops who have become very competitive on a worldwide level from the major OEM's or in networking, even software is starting to grow at healthier pace than we would have seen a few years ago as more, and more companies comfortable with buying software as opposed to coping it.

I think with the time zones, with everything that we’ve got going for us, there may be a possibility but again, we’ve got a lot to look at with the advertisers and where this economy comes back. I don’t think it’s unrealistic but it’s a little early to try and figure that one out entirely yet.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and last and least, the rework issue here in the US did that result in any out of stocks at retail or any impact on revenues in the quarter?","Well, that certainly already been, to whatever degree it was, it’s there. It’s hard to measure that. This was, as I said, these were the rear wheel drive products. At the same time, we still have front wheel drive products on the floor and Lawn-Boy products on the floor at depot. Did it have – did the customer choose not to buy a Toro, buy something else as a result. We handled this – the team handled this very fast, very aggressively, and so while at the end of the day, it didn’t help, we don’t think it had any material impact on retail.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
BJRI,Q2,2019,"Okay, and maybe just one last one. Are any stores that have hit a stride with the new kitchen systems seeing any labor savings benefit from the new systems?","No, Chris, I mean, it, A, is still a bit early and, you know, as we've been saying consistently, is we're doing this for quality, you know, team member, great place to work, all of the nerve center of what our kitchens are. We do think that over time all -- all of this process, reengineering and organization will yield some savings but, we're not -- we're not -- honestly, we're not asking for savings at this point and as people are, you know, as our operators are scheduling labor from this perspective, I think we're a bit away from that but, you know, we'll likely see some but it's just too early. We want to make sure these get engrained the right way and we're prioritizing the most important reasons we're putting these systems in place and, you know, think of it as a second -- a second phase of looking at our kitchens once these are embedded in behaviors.And that's the thing, I mean, just to highlight as Greg's been describing, the rollout itself is more around physical organization and retraining. The ongoing part of GSKS is the behavior changes of what people are doing when and those take a little bit more time.

GCI,Q3,2009,"Okay, and maybe one last thing -- Craig, do you have any thoughts on the NBC as a cable network? That’s popped up into the whole set of discussions around NBC Universal and even if that would take years to unwind with affiliate relationships, it probably wouldn’t be viewed as a good trend for the largest NBC affiliate group operator. Is there any reality to that whole notion at all and how would you react?","You know, obviously we are not anywhere a part of those discussions but I think your conclusion, it probably wouldn’t be in the very best interest of us from the affiliate standpoint, but we’re just going to have to wait and see. There’s an awful lot going on in those discussions and time will tell and we will respond appropriately at that time.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0
BLIN,Q3,2019,"Okay, and now, I guess in terms of really nice outlook for 2020, what for modeling purposes I guess, what would you estimate what top line revenue would get you to operating income or operating breakeven?","Sure. So, we're going to have top line income in the $5 million range to be generating net income and most of that revenue is kind of locked in already. We are not recognizing all of that yet because of this transaction accounting and the acquired contracts. But the first anniversary for all the acquired contracts is February 2020. And at that point, based on what we have already we're going to be pretty close there and we think that we're going to be generating positive net income early in 2020.And also, you know, we've got no debt on the books right now. We finished the quarter with decent cash balance and do not anticipate doing any equity raising or anything between now and then, possibly establishing a credit line or something, but that would be it.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
PTEC,Q1,2009,"Okay, and the other thing is, what do you anticipate is the take-up rate of your new products? The HyperSpace is very new and the FailSafe is already introduced a couple of quarters. To get to the level thank you really like, is that kind of a number of a year out or are you looking actually this current fiscal year that you see significant changes in revenue from that?","If the economy does not completely disrupt our schedules we ought to have some pretty significant revenues in the fourth quarter, but we have to now be more conservative than that and so it might slip into early next fiscal year, which for us would be the fourth quarter of calendar year or maybe the first quarter of the next year.",2.0,1.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
GME,Q3,2013,"Okay, and then -- I mean, but just based on the fact you just re-upped your share repurchase program, there's no reason to think that you wouldn't buy back stock in Q4. I mean, is there?","Well, no, we're committed to the buyback program. Re-upping the authorization is, obviously, a symbol of that. However, as we go into a quarter given what the price might do and there's been some volatility in it this year, it's tough for us to predict exactly what we might buy in terms of share count. So our practice has been, over the course of the past 3 years, just to base it on what we know has been completed.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

VICL,Q2,2010,"Okay, and then I know would you can't say exactly when the Allovectin results might be out, but is mid next year still a decent estimate there.","We should have some good idea going into first quarter, remember there are two issues in Allovectin-7? We have a minimum of 12 months follow up and that 12 months follow up ends in Feb? At that point in time if all the patients are off treatment, then it’s a matter of closing the database, but there are still a lot of patients on the study, then we are not going to close the database and continue to treat the patients because we want to make sure we get responders out, the study is blinded to us.

So, I think by Feb of next year, we should have an idea of where we going to be and the second important point is survival, we want to make sure that when we close the data base, we also lock in the survival. So, I think at this point in time, middle of the year or second half should be a reasonable time but we will give you a better understanding in the first quarter of next year.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,1.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then a couple of quick questions. You mentioned you picked up snow placement for next year with big boxes, was there a one particular big box, was there a particular pipeline fill that was going on in this quarter that maybe kind of inflated the revenue because of that?","Well, not because of that. I would say we have certainly shipped year – as we mentioned, we shipped year-over-year snow a little earlier, that’s driven as much by field inventories were very depleted, and while we’re still in August, people are buying snow throwers as we speak as we talk to dealers and we talk to depot and so. If they’re going to be buying snow throwers, we need to be there so that did pull the shipments forward a bit.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
HLX,Q2,2010,"Okay, and then a final question, the HP I expectation you get that back on the Phoenix field starting up, I guess September, do you have, I mean that’s kind of the hurricane season obviously, September in terms of disrupting operations. Is that factored into it or is this timeline you’re considering right now basically consistent with release from Macondo unit and the shipyard and then that’s when it would be available, I mean can you get it on sooner, would be I guess the short question there.","Our outlook is strictly based on our guess on when the vessel will be released from the Macondo efforts. So we’re assuming late Q3, but it could be sooner or it could be later, we just don’t know. We’re out there to help the situation as long as BP needs to, the vessel we’re going to her out there.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
TECD,Q4,2008,"Okay, and then a follow-up if I could on the pricing environment. In North America, you talked about it being particularly difficult. Any additional color here from a customer segment perspective, when you look at the retail, DMR, bar channels, where was it most acute, was it on the product side or was it on the customer side in North America?","Yes, it was pretty much across the board, Bill. The market environment feels consistent in all segments right now. If there is any strength to be seen I still believe it’s in the SMB market where our value proposition, the combination of Tech Data and the value that the bar brings can realize as higher margin to an SMB customer than it tends to a larger national or retail business. And that's why you continue to hear us focus on SMB as a market opportunity that as Jeff said, where our SG&A increased over the calendar year was almost totally focused at SMB penetration. So that’s the spot where we think the opportunity still exists and that’s the spot where we continue to invest.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then as far as the outlook, as far the commodities, I know that, it’s pretty clear on the last call that commodities will be higher in the back half. How should we think about commodities and the higher freight going into, I guess the fourth quarter, and into the early next year on the flow?","Well, I think, relative to as we wrap up the year that’s reflected in our guidance. So, as we’ve said we will work to have our gross margins remain kind of flat through the rest of the year now. Much of that inventory has been built. As we think about commodities, and you know, commodities move in one direction, and then they move in another direction. As we think about commodities for 2012, that’s something we’re building our plans around right now looking at – as we said before we don’t price to cost, but we look at what’s going on in the industry, and so as we project commodities for 2012 that will be factored into our pricing strategy as always. So in the fourth quarter is when we start moving out with some of the 2012 pricing and setting the stage for next season’s spring business if you will.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then as far as the product rework expense, what exactly was the issue and did it affect Toro brand or different brand, and then is there any risk for like products, like warranty claims coming down the road?","Yes, it’s a good question. We think we factored all the expense in that we will face. It was a disappointing issue, it was a case where we made an engineering change to improve the product, and these things happen sometimes, not very often to this magnitude that for whatever reason we missed catching an unintended consequence. So, as I said earlier, it’s not a safety issue, it was a fairly easy fix, but because of the quantity of replacing a couple of screws, because of the quantity of the mowers involved in bringing them back, as Blake talked about the freight expense and everything else, it just turned out to be a very expensive rework. We were very appreciative with our partners, depot and dealers that helped get us through it, but at the end of the day, it certainly is one of those things where you're building equity, brand equity, or you are borrowing it. We probably borrowed some, but most of the product was fixed long before customers saw it. So, we're dealing with those units that did get sold. That was very much the smaller part of the quantity if you will. I don't think it will have any significant brand impact. It’s just an expensive lesson.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
BIO,Q4,2016,"Okay, and then final question for you, Christine. Have you taken a look at some of the proposed plans for corporate tax reform and what impact it might have on Bio-Rad? And I think the part I could use the most help with is the potential border tax adjustment. Given you have all these costs in Europe, it's unclear whether you're a net importer or exporter.","Okay. So I'll take that one first. We are a net exporter. It is true that we have a sizable footprint in Europe, but we also have a sizable footprint here in the United States, and on both sides of the business, but especially on the Life Science side, we are a net exporter. Regards to some of the other plans, we don't know until we know, until these plans become real, but whether it's what the Republican Party is talking about or Trump talks about from time to time, I think either way you slice it, Dan, we're probably going to be a beneficiary of that in terms of a lower tax rate in the U.S. And then, on top of that, we will be able to turn on a lower tax rate in Europe with the turning on of SAP in Europe. So if we're really lucky, we'll get a benefit in Europe as well as a benefit of whatever they do here in the U.S.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then finally, I think you mentioned some new electric mowers maybe in the landscaper side to lower fuel costs. Can you kind of maybe just talk about longer-term, where you see electric mowers going, and kind of maybe on the retail side as well?","Let me be clear. That’s not an electric mower. It's an electronic fuel injection system that is on the engine that allows the unit to leverage its fuel use far more. So it's still a gas powered product. But to your question on electrics, we continue to invest in alternative fuel strategies. So, for example, we're right around the corner for starting production on the first lithium-ion battery-powered walk greens mower. So, whether it's the golf arena, or the landscape contractor business, or the consumer business, you will see more and more alternative fuel, and a number of those will be battery-powered kind of products in the market from Toro in the future.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then just last, I was just wondering what you can tell us about the freight cost, was that an unexpected thing or was that worst than last quarter as far as the impact on margins?","Mike, this is Blake Grams, so I’ll talk to that. So, we had a kind of double-whammy on the freight, so obviously with diesel prices increasing during the year, that’s obviously hit us worse in the back half of the year. And then also as we export products overseas, this cost of shipping those products overseas has also seen a very significant increase over this year as the export economy has continued to grow in the US and imports coming in and such. Then obviously, with the rework issue we had, we had moving a lot of products multiple times, unfortunately, which also caused some freight challenges with us. So, with the moderation of gas and diesel prices as of late, we hope we’ll see a little bit of positive impact as we go forward, but it was definitely a real challenge for us, and probably little bit worse than we expected as we came into the year.",2.0,0.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Okay, and then just on the knee business. One of the things, one of your competitors talked about was sort of a heavier mix in primaries versus revisions I guess given that revisions were a bit more of an acute emergent. They are ever more emergent procedures or more of those during the pandemic maybe than primary in some areas, one if you're seeing something like that or any demographic mix shifts just because of what we've been through and the types of patients that we're get needed since nine months ago versus those that are coming through now, any color would be great?","Yes man, nothing specific to report in that area. I mean, the one thing that we have seen throughout the pandemic is variability, and so certainly by geography and by area you're getting a lot of variability. So, again, nothing that I would I would specifically point you to in terms of our mix.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,1.0,2.0
BJRI,Q2,2019,"Okay, and then just one last question around the new store development. Obviously you highlight this strong opening. I just had a question around the stores when they drop into the comp base. I think there were two this quarter, I think one next quarter, but I mean, how do the honeymoon periods look? You're entering newer kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 markets specifically in Connecticut for the first time. You know, how do these stores hold up after 18 months?","Yes, we tend to still see really the same trends in our business and that is at 18 months they generally come into the comp base a little bit in the negative because the honeymoon timeframe and then from there they start to flatten out and start to move ourselves better overall. And I don't think we've seen any real change of that. I accept the fact that our new restaurants are opening strong and as a result, when they come off the honeymoon, they're not coming down nearly maybe where they were in some of the other markets. So, I think as we look at it and see it as they come into the base, maybe there's a little bit less of a drag on them then maybe where they were -- the classes in the past years.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0

VSH,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then maybe secondly here, you mentioned the automotive market holding about – there’s a lot of questions about global production slowing down a little bit here with issues in the supply chain. Are you seeing any incremental slowdown on the fourth quarter, or do you expect, you know, that to tapper off? It’s been an area of strength throughout the third quarter.","The moment we see – I’m talking mainly Europe I must admit but at the moment, people are really extremely optimistic in that. What we have seen in automotive maybe here and there, is some accumulation of inventories in the pipeline which needs a correction but this correction is underway but for my standpoint, the standpoint of this in production there is no slowdown as they say as they indicate as a longer trend or the mid-term trend so they are – they are continued to be confident on it.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,1.0,2.0
TTC,Q3,2011,"Okay, and then on the Professional segment, you said golf was strong, but then you said that product mix was a little bit of issue on the margins, just trying to look at the two and where am I missing, some in golf typically higher margin or was it something else within golf or something else that brought the product mix being I guess more unfavorable?","Yes, within the Professional segment we have some things like factoring in the acquisition of Unique put some pressure on the margins. All-in golf as you know is one of the stronger, more profitable businesses, and so – but there's still some moment even within that area. But I would leave it at golf is very healthy.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,1.0,2.0

We’ve just seeing no deterioration of that and therefore this period of Macondo is just been sort of adding backlog. So we’re looking really strong going forward, I might add, if the moratorium – it depends what happens with the rigs if the rigs start leaving the Gulf of Mexico then when the moratorium is lifted there is going to be a rather than an oversupply there is going to be an undersupply of rigs which would benefit us greatly.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Quite candidly, as we see these spike ups, whether it be natural gas or whether it be oil prices, I think the oil patch is so active and utilization is so tight right now that you don't see significant peaks from that. I think capacity [ph] is very active. It just allows people to have confidence in continuing the projects they have out there, which means that the rigs will be active for a longer period of time. But I don't think we see a huge change in number just based on the price of oil and gas. I think quite candidly, I think as we head into the winner, depending on what happens in the winner timeframe, we might see natural gas continue to hold well, and that will continue to keep drilling activity high. I think Canada will probably improve its drilling in the second half of the year, maybe to what it was in the first half. And we are optimistic about that because we have quite a footprint of businesses in Canada.

I mean, I think it's kind of always a constant on and the other element I'd mention is people forget about, we're competing in a very fragmented industry at the end of the day; the number of independent seats out there is much greater than the chains we all think and talk about. So -- so, honestly, I just think that can be a little overdone and over talked about in our -- in our space at times. It's something, obviously, we pay a lot of attention to in general as our business is going up and down and so we'll make adjustments.

And on the reiterated target for a little bit of growth in EMEA for the whole Company, is that just because Russia, it is not going to be down 50% again? I know it's only a modest acceleration, but are you seeing anything there that makes you incrementally more confident in your ability to accelerate here from the flat growth that came in the first quarter?","Yes, part of that should be because the impact of Russia will be less as we move through the year. You know, Russia was getting worse last year as we progressed. Our view is it shouldn't get much worse than it was in the first quarter, so that the incremental impact quarter over quarter should be less to us. But we also have new product launches and we've got some other plans and programs that we think are positive. And we'll continue to work those for the next nine months.

So, we're talking about cost-cutting and leverage of this business including I think -- I just want to make I heard this correctly that reimbursement is higher. And when you think about it the reimbursement cuts are higher than what you saw in the last three years. So, you're conservative on reimbursement. It sounds like Alex that you have a line of sight to where the scripts are coming from, from that perspective 2% to 3% on the topline. Cost-cutting is going to get you to that five percentage range. Do I have that all correct?","Yes. Just be careful. The revenue doesn't track the scripts. So, for example, and I won't say much more than this, if you assume higher generic penetration which typically improves and has been improving over a fairly long period of time and will still improve not by major amounts that will have a deflationary amount on your -- deflationary impact on your revenue.So, we would believe that the scripts would be higher than 2% to 3%.

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Okay, great. And just last quick question, just regarding cost. Pat, you didn’t call out a COVID related cost. Is that just sort of embedded in your model now, or do you see any changes there?","So for the first quarter, it was around $2 million. So it’s starting to taper down. We do expect expenses in the latter quarters, probably to the tune of $1 million to $1.5 million. When you look year-over-year, last year, fiscal 2020, we had about $10 million. This year, we would think that’s about $6 million, so about $4 million lower there. On another area of costs, our healthcare costs internal were depressed with last year with elective procedures being down. We expect those to be up and that pretty much offsets the benefit we’re seeing from a COVID expense reduction. We expect Healthcare costs to be up about $4 million this year.

","I see it as separate models. It's vague. There's people argue, it's part of the BOT model. But I see it as an expansion of that, if you will.

OCX,Q1,2020,"Okay, great. And then for IO, what would be either the very pushback from pharma or what are they – you obviously have got some great results here. What are they most complementary about using the test in their study?","I’m going to let Doug add because he’s very close to this in the discussion of pharma. I think they already have a lot of studies with PD-L1 which as you know Merck did a great job of using PD-L1 to get everybody on the drug, but we know that only about 40% to 45% of the patients that are deemed as potentially responders by PD-L1 actually respond. So you have a high percentage of the patients that go on the drug that don’t get a response, healthcare pays the bill and that patient is exposed to an immune therapy that basically can begin to increase the number of autoimmune diseases in our industry which would be bad as well. So I think for us, the idea – at least pharma is that while PD-L1 gets everybody in, what we are positioning as we’re discriminating a marker that can identify sustained response. So not only can we predict who should be in, we can also predict who should not be in. And so that’s one of the headwinds. It’s just overcoming the momentum that PD-L1 already has in these trials, but there are a number of companies chasing Merck that would love to have a marker that would identify patient populations that would allow them new niches, if you will, in the world.

And then just clarify whether that implied 4Q guide includes things like potential sale leaseback proceeds? Thank you.","So we do have a significant amount of earnings included in the fourth quarter; one, due to the timing shift of the holiday period. So, the third quarter this year ends on the Saturday right after Thanksgiving, whereas last year it had included Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the full week following that. So that’s one item that the fourth quarter now picked up that initial week following Thanksgiving.Additionally, with the incremental marketing and promotional spend that we’re adding for the year, if you may recall that from the accounting rules, once you send an event out, you immediately have to expense that event in full, even though the benefits of that event may spread over a period of time. And so it will impact third quarter more heavily and benefit fourth quarter, because they’ll have some sale spill over into that period.I’m sorry, as far as considering the proceeds from sale leasebacks that does not contemplate in the model.",2.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,2.0

So right now, there’s not a lot beyond testing in point of care testing that I would call a true COVID tailwind, where the demand is up as a result of COVID. Now we see that demand is progressing or continuing at least through calendar 2021. And even our customers are talking about it going beyond that and enter 2022. And one thing to point out too and we call them COVID testers a lot, but what they are is, they’re testers that can be used for COVID. So they can test many other things as well too.

And you’re always gaining. We actually added a significant number this year of dealers for both ATV and Prowler. Now some of those may have been connected, because they wanted to go ahead and carry the Wildcat line as well.
The Wildcat, obviously a lot of our dealers picked up the Wildcat. I don’t believe we had any Wildcat-only type dealers. So if you had a dealer in an area that carried ATVs and Prowlers but didn’t want the Wildcat, whether somebody else has stepped up.

We were at about 3.4% both in the first quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. So, we haven’t seen any appreciable change from what we have experienced. In fact, it was about 3.4% in the fourth quarter of this last fiscal year. So, as a result, I would tell you that we were able a year ago to pass on… a year to 18 months ago to pass on some of these cost increases through to our customers.

Firstly, when we put our organization together under the four lines of business, we were particular about the people we put in place though there was some degree of churn there when we looked at people with the right skills to go into the right slots. Secondly, I think we are driving a different culture here. It's very much a culture of winning. It's very much culture of value. And not everybody felt comfortable in that so there was some churn with that, but nothing that was regrettable. Thirdly, we are bringing some fabulous talent in. The people that we are bringing in are very strong, very competitive, high energy.

We had a much better utilization of the Taiwan manufacturing facility. I would imagine those two things would be helping. So I'm just trying to figure out where the steady state gross margin number should be? I mean are we now looking at 15%, 16% as the number? And can you still get back to the high-teens where you thought you could get maybe six months ago?","Let me take, Mark. So if we go back to prior to let's say all of those hard disk drive, memory stuff happening, probably about three quarters ago, you will see that we were probably about 16% to 17% as far as the gross margin is concerned. And so in prior quarter – in the June quarter, we said that of that 1.5% decline, majority of that was caused by the hard disk drive and memory and then this quarter I have said that over 2% basically has been caused by the hard disk drive and memory. So you will see a total of around approximately at least 3% caused by hard disk drives and memory over the last couple of quarters, right? As we work our way through the agreements and improve our vendor relationships and work it, we're hopeful that we can get that back so that – again we can get back to that place where we started off about six months ago, nine months ago back to the 16% to 17%. And then you are right. We do have the other things that should be adding to our gross margins which is the Romley launch coming on board and that's increasing our Taiwan facility utilization and then also obviously increasing our product mix with servers and software and support services. So those things are still working and they're going on. I think we just need to work our way through the hard disk drives and memory.",2.0,1.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
TWI,Q4,2017,"Okay, great. Thanks. And then just my last question is on working capital for this year. I know it’s a decent use in 2017 as your inventories and your inventories were up. What’s the expectation for working capital in 2018? Do you expect it to be more of a source of cash?","Working capital – Jim made some comments and Jim you can jump in on this as well. Jim made some comments about the investments we had to make to support the growth in sales. My expectations for the team this year is that we should hold the line and Jim mentioned that our cash conversion cycle days have remained stable. But from a dollar standpoint we need to be very aggressively holding the line on what we invest in the working capital. So it’s an important area of focus for us. It can be a challenge obviously when the business is growing on how much you invest in working capital and obviously what [indiscernible] in a very timely effective manner [indiscernible] watching it very closely and not just building inventory for the sake of building inventory. They better have a plan, a reason that supports why they’re making that investment into working capital. And I think we’re on that path but it’s going to be – we got to focus on throughout the year.

What’s the expectation for working capital in 2018? Do you expect it to be more of a source of cash?","Yes, Paul. It’s clearly on our scorecard. We look at it but there was – I’d mentioned that there was a focus on aftermarket. You have to have the inventory in that area to sell it at the right time. And then heading into the new year, the aftermarket picks up. So we had to build the inventory to make sure that the tire was there as we mentioned to be sold. So we have this build up at the end of the year going into 2018. And then as Paul said, we’ve got initiatives. We both take a close look at it and the businesses do and we look at our cash conversion days. So they’ve been improving except for this last quarter where they evened out and again that was due to primarily stocking and making sure that we can make that sale and continue the double digit growth.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
GME,Q3,2013,"Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, sort of related, just to clarify the -- you're assuming 118 million diluted shares outstanding for Q4.

UHS,Q2,2012,"Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then just the last one. I think there has been questions in the past on sort of the margin in EBITDA growth and behavioral and revenue trends have been higher. Revenue was obviously a little bit lower this quarter but you had better margins in growth. So I guess is that related CSI synergies incrementally coming on board or is it just more broad based maybe sustainability of that going forward?","You know, I think the answer is sort of two-fold. One, again as you alluded to Ralph is, I certainly think that we continue to improve the PSI legacy margins if you will, and in short order we are going to stop using that term. But, I also believe and we have made the case that if we are able to grow revenues by 4% or 5% in what amounts to a fixed or largely fixed and semi-fixed cost business we should be able to continue to expand margins. Again, I think you saw that in Q2, it’s not always absolutely linear. So there are some quarters in which revenue grew by a little bit more and margins didn’t increase quite as much, and in Q2 of this year revenue was a little more moderated but cost controls were better. In general, I think if we can have that 5% revenue growth that I have mentioned a few times on the call, we should continue to generate expanded margins in the behavioral business.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

And again, do you expect a gradual recovery or short ramp back up as research and academic labs begin to open up?","No, I think you’re hitting it pretty well. I’ve divided it into two pieces. One is the legacy pharma services business independent of the IO opportunity and then the second is the IO opportunity enrolling trials where we could test out the biomarker with new agents. And I would say believe it or not, sheltering in place has greased the wheel a little bit of conversations and negotiations where, as Ronnie said, the actual execution of these things have been delayed a little bit. So it’s a mixed bag. We did have some delays in our conversations with some clinical trials we were trying to access that were in areas where there was pretty bad pandemic outbreak.

And again, do you expect a gradual recovery or short ramp back up as research and academic labs begin to open up?","Yes, this is one where I’ll recruit Dr. Ross or Dr. Hesterberg as well, but it’s interesting because right out of the gate the first couple of weeks, a lot of the engagement we had with the pharma companies themselves went down significantly in the quiet. And obviously after a few weeks, things began to open back up and we began to reengage. What we do know is just from that feedback from the industry and my role at ASCO, we are hearing that there has been a reluctance of patients to go to the hospital to be treated and thus the number of patients that would normally get diagnosed and potentially put on a trial has slowed. But what we do know is the engagement with pharma and the interest in what we’re doing is starting to pick back up. When those patients will actually show up and start begin enrolling in various trials is really still up for grabs I think, but we don’t have really direct insight to that expect through our pharma partners.

I'd say that given where we are on working capital and the fact that we have essentially best in class working capital metrics, obviously that leads to the biggest portion of upside opportunity coming from operating margin improvement. So although I would say working capital of course is an area we will continue to focus on and probably can shave some of the ROIC increase out of that, the lion's share will come from operating margin improvement over the years.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

We're not going to get too far into those specifics for competitive reasons, obviously, but -- but our -- most importantly is the product lineup that has been, you know, we really have constructed these both a la carte items and these combinations with value in mind. So, you know, at the starting price points you can see large parties at -- at and around $10.00 per person which we think is quite compelling.

I think from an acquisition perspective, international we're certainly looking at transactions that would perhaps give us some scale and some presence in the platform in various geographies in addition to technology, but I have to say that also when we evaluate acquisition opportunities in that take, we are looking very clearly at new platforms and new businesses beyond just technology and looking for new sizable acquisitions to pursue into evaluating part of the overall Cantel family.

They’re cautious about the global economy and what’s going on in Europe and then election here in United States. And so but hopefully with now all this behind us that things will move in a right direction as we enter the January timeframe. So we’re pretty optimistic. But again, back to these components, we do expect this portfolio to grow at a faster rate than traditional EMS business. Especially, how we are repositioned these businesses as independent as humanly possible, and also I think we strengthen them both from a capabilities point of view so they can compete in the future. I mean, if we didn’t believe that these businesses are not going to add a lot of value in the future, we would not be investing in these businesses. So we’re very excited, because that this is the side that should be a lot bigger than what it is today, has a lot of potential, and as the economy turns around, we’re pretty optimistic about this diversified portfolio of Components, Products & Services that we have. As I mentioned on our call earlier, we really expanded our global services, which includes repairs, with some major partner in the mission-critical type of products. Most importantly we’ve built a foundation in that side of the business that can be a $1 billion plus business. And the margin in those type of business, as we all know, are better than traditional EMS. So we’re really investing in the businesses that can deliver the better results going forwards. So, yeah, growth is very critical to us right now and there’s a lot of focus, but growing with the right customers, the right project and also invest in a businesses that are going to be sustainable for many years in the future.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
BBBY,Q2,2019,"Okay, thanks. And then I guess just a couple of things, a couple adjustments you guys have made I guess in this release and then a prior quarter or two. You took a, what looks like a sizable reduction in your sales return liability you know in the last couple of quarters relative to last year, like more than 200 basis points by your math, as a percentage of sales. I was just wondering what would have driven that, and you know that large reduction? And then my other question is just on the size of the inventory adjustment this quarter in terms of like adding it all back to adjusted earnings.","So, from a sales return perspective, that reserve is definitely impacted by the seasonality of our business. And so if sales you know are coming down, depending on the time of the year that we’re in, we’re certainly going to see reductions in that reserve.In addition, we made some changes to our returns policy, which over time we would assume that the sales returns would be fewer than what we’ve had experienced in the past. However, we don’t know if we’ve compromised sales by some of those changes initially from a customer-facing perspective.But again, over time, the sales return policy would impact it, if you have a specific quarter detailed dollars, we could certainly have a follow-up call to walk through the mechanics of what you’re seeing.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
TECD,Q4,2008,"Okay, thanks. And then just I know several people have asked about the gross margin and I guess the challenge is to, how do you model going forward when you have that big benefit. Last quarter, you talked about continued pricing pressure in North America. Here, you do seem to be disciplined. You got better mix going. Is it fair to say that you are striving for the 4.9 to 5.05 range over the next couple of quarters or are you willing to kind of give some of that back just to keep the volumes up?","Matt, I am not sure we can answer that, but clearly our view of the model has been that based upon our business and our geography, having a five from the number, would be a more challenging answer than otherwise. I am not saying we can't, but that would all say that the range you just gave which is somewhat in line. The average for the last two years is probably aspirationally in the range. And then, we will have to see what the market declines were, what markets have less declined and see how competitive it gets.

It will be a balancing act quarter-by-quarter as we, our vendors and the competitors see what market is available to us out there. But, you just gave a range which is what we have achieved over the last couple of years on an annualized basis. We don’t have any goal to continue to diminish that. We don’t have any change in our mix in the business. It would be the backend availability and our ability to achieve that from our vendors coupled with the competitive nature which will yield the final answer on that.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
CMN,Q1,2015,"Okay, thanks. And then, Craig, I loved the detail but then the more detail you get, the more questions you get. I still loved the detail. The tax rate, you explained, that was one of the things that you sort of highlighted in the press release and then you explained that and a lot of that is the non-tax-deductibility of the acquisition cost, but just to clarify, those acquisition costs for IMS came in Q1 because you book them and bill them when they happen not when the deal closes, is that right?","Yes, that is exactly right, and this is related to new accounting items from a few years back. So these acquisition costs now are, number one expensed and number two expensed as you incur them. So almost all the due diligence for that field occur in the first quarter because I think we closed the deal November 1. So that's exactly right. It was about $0.5 million of expenses, all non-deductible.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0
SCHL,Q4,2015,"Okay, thanks. Just to follow-up to Barry's question on capital allocation; Dick, can you talk about the board's position on buybacks versus dividends, and philosophically how you approach that? I can appreciate that the $50 million addition to the share buyback, but I know in the past you guys have been reluctant to buyback more stock and -- concerns around reducing your liquidity further given the large buybacks you've done in the past. So can you just address philosophically how the board looks at dividends versus buybacks going forward?","Sure. Well, I should remind you that since 2006 we have returned like $560 million to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends. So we haven't been bashful about this over time. The board really didn't stop to consider our dividend policy at this point, Barry, as for this board meeting. I think we're looking to talk about this in our September meeting to figure out for our next year of operation what our dividend policy should be short and longer term. So the lack of an increase in the dividend is not a statement on our long-term attitude toward dividends. At the same time, we are -- sorry, Drew, this is in response to your question, not to Barry. In response to the buybacks, I think again, we will come back to you with a program on the stock buybacks that will be clearer over time.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
CMN,Q1,2015,"Okay, thanks. That helps. And then I forget the initial intro, Andy. Is Jorgen there, and if so, can we talk a little bit about international expansion? You've got U.K. and Italy. Maybe a little bit more focus on emerging markets, if you could give us some color there?","I'm here, Tom. And in fact, I'm calling in from Sydney, even though that's not really an English market. So obviously the focus, Tom, as you could imagine, for the entire organization has been Italy and U.K., two very important transactions that impacted our revenue in Europe. So that has been the focus. As you know, as well outside Europe and in emerging markets, our key focus is China and we continue to be very active in China, have managed to now launch our top-of-the-line automatic industrial reprocessors into the Chinese market and have [virtual] [ph] machines now at the largest endoscopy center, GI center in Beijing. So we are moving ahead with our strategic focus building and marketing leadership position in China leading with our Endoscopy products and that will be followed by several products in some of our other businesses including sterility assurance and other key products that are getting through registration the next several quarters. So I think that's the key point. We have had also good growth in some of the [east European] [ph] markets where we have some good distributors that are [buying] [ph] business as well, but I think from a sort of a Company focus, the strategic focus, China is definitely our focal point at active time.",1.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,1.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"Okay, that's helpful. And then just on invoicing duration more generally, is this a trend? So I guess, as we think about that billings proxy and we think about your disclosure around total backlog and current backlog, it feels to me like the -- that backlog disclosure will become incrementally more important. And if that's right, are you going to just continue to give us that just once a year or are you going to potentially give us any more color around that as we go through quarters?","I guess, my comment on the growth of the backlog, I really do believe it's connected with the large deals. So the way to make some -- I suppose, some determination on it is, if we have this -- the large deal metric, I think, is what's important. And we talk about that every quarter, and you can basically add up the large deals for the year. The backlog metric is one that we disclose annually in the 10-K and we'll talk about it on the year end call.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,0.0,2.0

SXC,Q1,2014,"Okay, that's helpful. So this -- with that, when I think about your guidance change for 2014, Indiana Harbor essentially unchanged from where I had it previously. What do you think are the big kind of levers that caused the numbers to come down a little bit?","I would say Indiana Harbor is a little weaker, I'm not sure about your expectations, but certainly, versus our expectations. Second is the rest of the plants actually did have a weaker first quarter start, as the coal logistics and coal itself. So we basically, as Mark said, take the midpoint of that range down about 12.5, we were down about 20 in the first quarter relative to our target, so think of it as putting in roughly half of the first quarter mix into the guidance range.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
CMN,Q1,2015,"Okay, that's very helpful. Andy, I just wanted to circle back on the Healthcare Disposables business. I know you mentioned you had pretty nice organic growth in the quarter but some of that was driven by face masks and I guess Ebola related issues and some [figures of] [ph] price increases might have driven some business there. I was wondering if there was a way of maybe stripping that out and get what the underlying business grew at?","Obviously we don't know exactly the answer to that question, but I would estimate that we probably had a 4% to 6% organic growth, so somewhere between 40% to 50% of the growth, and that's just an estimate.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0
RAIL,Q4,2013,"Okay, that’s fair. And then, just the last thing is looking at your guidance so, if I look at the other backlog of 6,800 cars I assume that’s all are slated for 2014 delivery at this point?","Sal, yes, the majority of it is.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
TWI,Q4,2017,"Okay, that’s fine. Thank you. And then I guess, Paul, as we think about seasonality, it sounds like you have better results expected in the second half based on the mix and some things. Is that right or did I hear that wrong and I just want to understand first half or second half to make sure we model it correctly?","The seasonality, it’s a nature of the business. You got plant shutdowns that take place for the most part around the world. Midsummer I guess is a slower period in the European markets and then around the December holidays. And so you do have some natural seasonality that is built into just the business model. So I wouldn’t take that off the table for 2018. I think what we saw in 2017 was just the improving conditions taking effect in the second half of the year that propelled the back half to be strong in a way that we have not typically seen, as Jim had mentioned. But I would not take what happened in 2017 and apply it forward because you just have fewer working days available in the back half of the year compared to the first half.",1.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Is there some reasons structurally that First Aid has yet to have a gain leverage or is there some reason that Document Management would maybe experience less leverage going forward?","I would say that really the movement within the First Aid, Fire and Safety business, you have got a lot of fire locations that are coming online and we hope to increase the profitability there. I think as you can see we believe that the Document Management business is a very strong business, both from a growth and a profitability standpoint. Well, I continue to skyrocket each and others, it’s going to be upper limit obviously, but as we have been able to gain scale a lot quicker in that business just because of the effect businesses it is than we have in the Fire Protection Services business.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

This is a really critical period for us.

We're working on them. We've got a pretty good funnel or pyramid, if you will, of opportunities. We're in active conversations. I think the difference is we're going to remain disciplined. We don't want to overpay for things that -- it's pretty easy to determine the value of these enterprises. And you have to understand the motives of the sellers, and so on and so fort. So we're taking a rather disciplined approach. You might call it conservative, and I'm okay with that. But I will tell you that I'm disappointed we haven't landed anything of late. And we're working hard to do just that. My hope is that by the time we talk again, a quarter from now, we'll have some news. But you just can't predict this.

And I think we're really teed up versus – I'll take you back to the same period in 2016 and same period in 2015, when we were mid-fourth quarter with very high inventories coming into the lower demand part of the season, and that was a drag on margins.

But had it not been up, it would have added 0.06 or $0.07 to the earnings per share. So could you give us the reason for that? Is it a product mix change or is it additional spending of some kind or what?","We've had... Alex, this is Rob Kuhbach... we've had somewhat higher professional fees and we had to make some adjustments in our contingency reserves. We don't expect that to continue. The second quarter was somewhat higher than we expect, and I would say we've adjusted our overall annual corporate spend rate. If you look in the outlook stage on the slide, we head up [ph] slightly from probably a total of $5 million from where it was at the end of the first quarter. I would say the lion's share of that is some consulting fees that we've been engaged in. And part of that relates to our integration process planning and the overall business improvement process.

So to the extent we can identify those kind of things, we certainly will. The latest addition to this year's CapEx was part of -- as a result of the acquisition of Specialty Brands for instance, and gives us some opportunity to bring product in house and save a considerable amount of money.

Generally speaking you end up – the commodity prices and really the components that go into our products are known by our customers. So generally speaking you end up pricing in an equilibrium manner between your price and your cost. And it’s just when you get those rapid changes that you get some things to get out of whack.

It shot up like a rocket. Everybody as you said in the industry was surprised. And then it continued in the second quarter. It took a while for the rocket to come down. But it totaled about $19 million that we could not pass on or the industry as far as that goes. As a result, we did strengthen our purchase policy, such things as dollar day averaging going out, et cetera, trying to do what we could within our own four walls to control it. So that helped out in the third and fourth quarter naturally. So that’s what I did. But as Paul said, it’s bad to “more normal.”",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So I think there's two parts to your question and let me try and get both of them and if I miss something, please jump in. So the first part is, is yes they have made a repayment to us in full, on time for both US and those portions they were, that their letter challenges, ex-US. So yes, and they've not filed any challenges ex-US to the patents in Europe or any place else.The second part is the action in Nevada is -- it's not patent case or a case involving the European patents. It's actually a contract case. So the question is whether or not when Genentech sent that [fax] at the behest of Roche and Novartis challenging the patents, whether that constituted a challenge to our 2003 settlement agreement and a settlement agreement is a contract and that's why I say this is breach of contract case, not a patent case.

Is there any reason to believe that the California market will begin to perform more in line with the rest of the system or should we all be assuming flat trends for the quarter is the base case to think about?","Brian, I don't know if we have an exact answer for you. I mean, when we look at our numbers we were somewhat surprised because there's actually fairly -- fairly -- it was a fairly quick change in the sales trends, meaning, we finished P6, let's just call it the mid-2's and every week in P6 was pretty solid. We thought the first week, and I do still believe the first week is a little bit of a July 4th flip from that standpoint, but as we started looking at some of our numbers, we did notice last year that we had the Miramar fires down in the San Diego area and that impacted a lot of our San Diego restaurants. We had a Madera fire, we had a Yucaipa fire out in -- Empire [ph] hitting some of our restaurants. So, I think as -- as we get through that, that should be cause for an -- an improvement in our California restaurants but, as we say, and we always say this kind of on the calls, we kind of give you the information that we have to-date and I know that sounds like sometimes not enough but even as we were looking at our business in June, we weren't expecting all of the sudden it to change from what we saw, literally the last week of June, to what we've seen the first couple of weeks of July.So, you know, I'm planning that it's going to improve and I think we've got good initiatives and things we like in our business from that standpoint. We feel very comfortable at least three weeks in how the rest of our portfolio is doing. We're -- we like the strength that we continue to see in those markets. As we said, that would be up in the mid-2% range, that's including in Texas, Florida, Ohio, etc. It's just California has come out of the gate a little bit softer here and as we went through and tried to analyze it and isolate it down, those are the things that we've seen a little bit softer in the Bay area.

The primary reason, Mike is the fact that the laws in Europe regarding privacy are just slightly behind with the laws in the U.S. and Canada have been. Therefore we believe, we are really in the forefront as this industry really starts taking hold in Europe. The other reason for doing document management is that as evidenced by what we have been able to achieve the first… the last couple of years in Document Management here.

I don't think there are networks that we know of that are similar to Ascend, so I think Ascend was – we think Ascend was just a great acquisition.

Is that how you see it playing out?","Matt, let me emphasize once more, it all relates only to our active business. I’ve said it before, on the past, except a few exceptions, we normally see and you will remember that very well constant prices, even in downturns. So because we are such a high share of specialty product. On the actives, clearly, the situation has normalized, and at the beginning of such a change, it overshoots a little. So I would expect that we already in the midst of very normal price decline. But we in the past were able to cope with it. So I am not – that we would be able to do it going forward.

In this year, we have a substantial number of three-year to five-year contracts rolling over in the aircrafts business.

In fact, one of the things that we're encouraged to see is that our takeout business lately has been growing and obviously we like takeout a little bit more because you don't pay those commissions to the delivery companies.Our catering is small. I believe I want to say it's less than 1% of our sales and we think that's where we've got an opportunity to grow that, it just rolled out with some of our changes here in the May timeframe and as I mentioned on our call, we're going to do some more marketing or some new marketing around that in Q3. We originally were going to do it in Q2 but frankly the catering packages and things we put together took a little bit longer to get out so that's some of the shift in the marketing side of things.

I mean, do you anticipate more of that's going to happen with your more focused effort or where’s sort of the bottom on that cost in the basin?","Well, our wells have come down in the quarter a lot due to reduced vendor. We've gone and consolidated vendors, and we're seeing some reductions in cost there. Our completion efficiency is up, and we're really improving our work around that. A big change that happened in the quarter was SWN sand. We were using about between 80% and 90% of SWN sand across the Fayetteville. We've now done some work and are able to use 100% of our SWN sand across the fields. So there's some rather dramatic reductions associated with that. The next tranche of savings comes from our pumping company that I mentioned earlier. We'll pump a large number of wells next year. The savings is somewhere between 150,000, 160,000 per well that we pump. And so you'll see further reductions there, and then we'll continue to chase further optimization. So I don't know -- I wouldn't speculate how far down it can go. We've made some rather dramatic strides in this area, and we'll continue to take those down.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Are we still very close to the bottom and do we still have a big runway in sort of the shift in mix, or where are we within that cycle?","Yes, the mix is still skewed compared to historical levels towards the small/mid. The large, while it’s improving, if you look at historical metrics going back over the last couple decades, it would tell you that there is definitely runway ahead for the large market to keep going. So I think that’s a positive that we’re not sitting here already having taken on the improvements in the large market. We got a lot of runway ahead of us. And for us, our plants operate very well. It’s what we’re designed to do. We’re designed to serve the large ag market. That’s the core of our company wherever you look around the world. And so as the large markets improve, we definitely have the capacity and the capabilities that’s second to none in our industries to serve customers in ways that not everybody can. And so we’re prepared for that. We’re going to continue to be prepared for that. Again, the only thing we got to do is keep hiring people and training them. But there is – again, compared to historical levels, there is runway ahead on the large market. Joe, one point on that is Jim and our Treasurer and IR VP, Todd are – they’re looking at how we can position ourselves from a tax standpoint, some moves we can make with how you set the company structure, pretty standard stuff that both – all of us have been doing for 20 plus years. So I think there’s ways where we can reduce that cash tax expense. Also along with that project taking a look at how we got our intercompany balances structured with our different entities and try to remove some of that FX volatility. So that project is underfoot and hopefully something that will get locked in here in 2018. But there will be improvement in both taxes and FX volatility.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

We would have expected you to deliver better margins year-over-year since you are not seeing HP's consolidation as the headwind this year?","Yes, and in Europe first of all I think we had a good performance overall in Europe. We had Spain and the UK and France actually perform well both on top line as well as their overall profitability performance. In Germany where we have been focused against recapture of market share we have had to apply additional resources against mitigation in service levels on warehouse management system, that is back to normal. But in addition that incremental costs just to regain market share back now we did see a recapture of most of that share late in the quarter in June. We do expect to see that going forward and in addition to that we do expect to see I guess a mitigation of some of the costs that we've had to expend in Germany, start the taper off through the second half of the year.

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Okay. And just maybe a longer-term question, you talked about the record over $3 billion funnel, you talked about committed to the 9% to 12% long-term revenue growth. Just trying to understand, does that imply potentially a supersized growth year in fiscal 2022, such that the average of 2021 and 2022 can be in the 9% to 12% range. So maybe just help with the expectations on timing and magnitude of what seems like a pretty big growth uptick upcoming.","Sure. This is Steve. I’ll try to handle that one. Obviously, trying to give guidance for 2022 would be a bit challenging. But looking at the market dynamics of where we’re at, which gives us some optimism is, we look at commercial aerospace and we’re strong in there, we’ve gain market share. We’ve talked about the fact that we’ve been bounce around the bottom and we see this down. And so we see that as a catalyst for growth in terms of what could happen in the 2022 as things are start to recover. We’ve talked about the elective procedures in Healthcare/Life Sciences. We believe we’re continuing to take market share, we’re winning new logos. And we think catalyst there to help accelerate some growth as we – as things start to recover post-COVID. And then, we’ve talked for the last couple of calls talking about industrial team in semi-cap – with semiconductor capital equipment, the signals are out there. The demand for semiconductor equipment and devices is only going to increase over time. And looking at our forecast and Todd’s kind of comments is, we see this flattish kind of forecast and then we see the short-term drop-ins. And I think at some point there’s a potential for that to turn into real forecast demand. And so, the optimism of the 9% to 12% is driven by those types of factors combined with the fact that we continue to win decent amounts of new business. And so I think – why we’re optimistic about the growth, could it outperform, I think, if the economy takes off and all these things start to recover post-COVID, I think there’s a real chance that demand from our customers continues to increase at a pretty good clip with it.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I think that we continue to believe those we put it back in our Material Handling group, as there might be some synergies that might share with our Palen [ph] business, and those are going to be explored, and hopefully we can find some additional benefits there.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
BLDR,Q3,2018,"Okay. And just really focusing, once again circling back on the value-added manufactured products. And as you continue to develop this more and build momentum in that business, what types of customers – and really, kind of want to get a better sense of regions and types of projects you're seeing greater acceptance. And where do you think that business can be, not just next year, but two to three years from now as a percentage of your total sales?
","One of the challenges we've had on that point is that with the growth in commodities, it's sort of been hiding the fact that we have been growing our manufactured products quite well. But that will prove itself out over time.

And where do you think that business can be, not just next year, but two to three years from now as a percentage of your total sales?
","Well, we see acceptance across all our single-family homebuilder categories, and certainly the multi-family side are big users. So those products aren't limited to national builders or custom builders. There's pretty good acceptance across all categories. As far as regions go, historically, components have been readily accepted in the Northeast, in the Northwest, a little less so in the South where you've traditionally had more labor availability, but that's changed. Those dynamics are changing. And so we're certainly seeing more acceptance in the Southern part of the country than we've had in the past. From a mix standpoint, gosh, we're going to continue to push. And anything we can do to drive down the pure commodity distribution business and expand the value-add side of the business, I think, gosh, we said it as a percent of sales that we can move that mix 1% to 2% a year that would be pretty successful in my mind.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SYKE,Q1,2015,"Okay. And last one from me, are you seen any changes in terms of new business on the billing type, either to more outcomes oriented or different models where you take on a little bit more of the risk?","Yes. There is definitely interest in that merging. I can tell you personally we are interested in that. I don't know if it's something that is going to become really broad-based and the norm. To get the outcome-based billing, it does require the client to come and give over to you certain control and trust that maybe they are not comfortable with. That fact alone I think will make it to where it will just become a component of the market. I don't know what percent. I could see it to maybe 20% of our portfolio would move into that way. And it's something we are interested in because we are operating with some of those outcome-based billing models today and they have proven to be quite successful. So we would like to get more of them.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
ENTR,Q4,2009,"Okay. And last question, Patrick, in terms of what customers are asking you for, are they hammering you on price more so now that you are starting to pick up some more of these bigger customers, potentially bigger customers down the road? Are they saying, hey, we may start to go to the other supplier down the road, and if you give us a pretty good price, we will lock you in for a year? Can you walk us through kind of how this selling process works right now for MoCA?","Yes. In my experience, customers always want lower prices and they always beat you up on that whenever you see them. But, we feel like, we are negotiating long-term pricing contracts with people, so we have pretty good predictability on price. We rarely provide that kind of long-term perspective. Whenever we win new designs, there is a service provider base, so we have pretty good visibility. We have a pretty good felling that we will be able to stay in our gross margin target range of 50% to 52%, because we continue to invest in the product lines, in terms of cost reductions like moving our MoCA 1.1 products to 65 nanometer as well as the R&D that we are doing around the pre-MoCA 2.0 stuff. So, we felt pretty good about stuff and we feel we have competitive pricing and we continue doing business based on that.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
MPAA,Q2,2013,"Okay. And last question, on the -- I know this Roth guy asked about the anticipated use of future cash flow. Just wanted to get a sense of how should we expect the capital structure to roll from here?","That's a good question. I think for now, we have a fairly stable structure. I'm not sure we have plenty of liquidity to pursue all the initiatives that we're interested in. We have a lot of growth organically, we believe, within our organization. We have a lot of opportunity with existing products and potential new products. And we have enough liquidity to support it. So at this point, I think we're comfortable we're going to generate cash. We're comfortable we have adequate liquidity to finance what our initiatives would be, barring something unusual. And so, I see relative stability in the capital structure. I mean, other than generating cash and deploying it.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,1.0,2.0
AMSWA,Q4,2016,"Okay. And lastly for me, just with the return of some of the higher license growth levels you've seen in recent quarters, what are your hiring plans like as we head into the current fiscal year?",This is Vince. We actually – at Voyager level of the high-end product we actually are at 21 dedicated salespeople. That's up from 14 this time last year. So that's a pretty big percentage increase for the Company.

CTAS,Q1,2008,"Okay. And looking forward now, this Project One Team, as it relates just to the rental division. What are those factors do you expected to have the most impact, because I presume they could impact, certainly attrition rates and new business sales. But I am curious as to what you are targeting to experience the biggest benefit from Project One Team?","Yes. I think it is going to affect all the components. I think the first one that we are targeting, obviously is the new business side because that’s where the focus one with the new sales organization, but certainly as we talk from the past, a significant reason to go to this organization was to allow our local management teams to focus on the servicing of customers and looking at ways to lower the amount of lost business and stops that are occurring. So, we hope to see it across the Board, but I would say, if you had to rank them the new business would be the first driver there?",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,0.0,2.0
BGFV,Q2,2013,"Okay. And maybe lastly, on the remodel program. Have those stores been open or kind of been -- is there a long of history there to gauge kind of how those are doing after the remodel? Or is it still too early in that program to say?","It's really early. I mean, we're still in the midst of completing the remodels. Again, there are varying degrees of activity that's associated with the individual remodels, but it's very pretty immature to make a comment as to how the -- how they're benefiting the business other than to say we feel very positive about what we're doing, and we'll certainly look forward to continuing on the program.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
CVU,Q3,2019,"Okay. And obviously, the guidance reflects the sort of the outlook there, but what's the visibility of improvements here on the legacy on WMI business into 2020? And at what point does it maybe get closer to CPI gross margins?","Well, I can address that, Ken. So this is Doug. The steps we've taken recently, in particular, the new system that we finally - we finally have their operating system and ours merged as one. They - as we executed on their contracts and particularly easier to do once they're under one roof with us, it was pretty clear that they had a lot of manual processes, a lot of excel spreadsheets, not a lot of forecasting, not a very good MRP system. And so the first step towards realizing the efficiencies that we've come to expect at the core CPI business, we feel we've taken the first step with the integration of those two systems.We are already seeing a little progress in that area. There's much more automation, there's much better working capital management and there's getting - the parts are getting out to the floor when they need to be there. So that's going to take probably this quarter and maybe into the first quarter of next year to start attaining the margins that we expect.And keep in mind, our expectation of WMI is not simply the CPI margins, we actually feel that we could achieve higher than our margins at WMI, and - but we need to get the manufacturing processes under control, and we think we've made the right step to do that.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,1.0
CTAS,Q1,2008,"Okay. And on the organic growth in the rental division, take that as slightly sequentially. Can you give us a sense when you look at the components of growth, was that primarily driven by new sales account growth, accelerating sequentially?","Yes, yes. Michael, I would say that the other drivers, when you take lost business at stops and price increases, I would say that’s very comparable to the fourth quarter in nature. And I would say that the growth is predominantly from the new business increase.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
SWN,Q3,2012,"Okay. And second question is G&A this quarter was really good. And I'm just wondering if you would think if this quarter run rate a good indication for future G&A expenses, or if there's something unusual this quarter that made it much lower.","Hi, this is Craig Owen. I’ll take that. The G&A, we did have a good quarter for G&A. I wouldn't expect that would be the go-forward run rate. I'd probably look at the year-to-date G&A, $0.25, $0.26 or a little bit higher. We had some benefits in the quarter and some nonrecurring items, nothing too substantial but the $0.21 we experienced in the quarter, probably not a good go-forward rate, more around $0.25, $0.26.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
AXGN,Q2,2018,"Okay. And sorry just last one.

Is some of those going to linger now into the third quarter and then you'll have a particularly strong quarter, how should we really think about the back half?","Yes. Look, we just think the back half is going to be -- is going to continue to be stronger. I think -- again, we don't give quarterly guidance, but I think if you just look at where you -- where we would need to be, it certainly suggests that we're going to get back over 40% in both quarters and moving north in that range as well.",2.0,0.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

And that last thing, can you talk about the growth of Hygiene business is kind of buried within that bigger segment and in particular the UltraClean that had been grown in the pretty exponential rates and have you hit a certain level of maturity in that business?","Well, we certainly have the rate… the rate of growth in that business has slowed somewhat as it has a bigger base but it still continues to grow. The Hygiene and UltraClean are growing faster than the Uniform Rental business is growing. I mean, we are still seeing the headwinds of the shift in types of labor that exists in the U.S. and therefore it is having an impact on our Garment Rental Programs. But the Hygiene in the UltraClean businesses are certainly the factor growing pieces of it albeit on a much smaller base.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0

SCHL,Q4,2015,Okay. And the CapEx that you're guiding to this year is elevated [ph] obviously. What is a more normalized run rate for CapEx going forward?,"Also, I should say that our definition of free cash flow in 2016 does not include the $186 million tax payment related to Ed Tech sales. So that is not included, which would write down our cash balance at year end. As far as the normal CapEx, I think the range that we are guiding to today is more normal. If you look at our historical levels that would be the range we are normally in. The last two years we stopped CapEx, particularly in the technology area as we assessed what our corporate level needs were. And most of what we spent last year in technology was expense, as opposed to capitalized, because we were in the design phase.

And the follow-up question on that is, as your business improves, and you make merchandise changes, product selection changes that improve things, do you think that kind of raises the bar on what performance you expect from some of the stores? And might we expect to see maybe more closings as a result of some of them doing better? Or is that not the right way to look at it?","Yes, I don't think that's the right way to look at it. I think the changes that we've made are fundamentally helping, we think, virtually. All of our stores, generally, have been positive -- positive across the board, so I don't see any thought that the initiatives or changes that we're making would create any more pressures to close stores that existed in the past.

There is limited signs and those fronts need to be focused on making sure we are successful in pancreatic, we’ve done a reasonable job of engaging others in support of the trial, NIH has been helpful in rectal and head/neck.

And the expectation in terms of the use of those proceeds, we said up to up to half of those proceeds would roughly be used to buy back shares, and we would anticipate that to be roughly 4 million to 5 million shares in the year.

I guess I would just -- at this point, is to anticipate kind of -- I'm doing my modeling, I'm just running out the current quarter out to the balance of the year is what I would just suggest to you. I think changes, up or down, with the -- I wouldn't anticipate any of this from a modeling perspective, but even if there were, they probably wouldn't be significant.

And while the categories aren’t growing at the rate that we had maybe originally planned, our competitive situation is pretty strong. We have two-thirds of our growing share and two-thirds of our category sales. And so I think that would not happen without some meaningful contributions from our new products.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0

We saw a very competitive promotional environment there. And if you watch our shares, you saw that business down quite a bit, and as to a lesser extent vegetables. And so I think there were some competitiveness issues there.

I mean, as we go down that, our U.S. portfolio, we feel very good about those. The Foodservice -- Convenience and Foodservice business is entirely driven by new product innovation, whether it’s Go-GURT and McDonald’s or new varieties of Greek, new chips, new offerings to K-12s. We like the innovation there, and we have good innovation across Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso in Europe. So the new products are very much important for us and part of the mix.

I know a big driver of that businesses, those two end markets.

I think as soon as things are normal then why should this not be or go back to normal? But what we count on is a better participation, the high voltage MOSFETs where Vishay historically hasn't been really and now we will have probably see a light at the end of the tunnel in a way, we see product which can compete with everybody. And we are going to start manufacturing them next year, beginning of next year, in large quantities. So I see, for MOSFET, should return to normal conditions. Why not?

So, I'm wondering if there's any sort of hedging you've started to do more on the euro side or if there was anything that I'm missing just in terms of FX impact on sales in Europe, in EU?","No. I don't think, Judy, you're missing anything. We didn't do anything on the euro for the hedges which would have an impact. I think it's just – I guess it's just the timing. We always operate with a third of our quarterly numbers, but the end of the day, it's a sum of the parts of the monthly exchange rates which we use for the – for our P&L for our income statement. Maybe it's just the timing of – euro was pretty volatile, pretty dynamic in terms of the depreciation last year.

How long did you do due diligence on that and I guess what were the major gaining factors that drove you to agree to that agreement? Thank you.,"So I'm not going to discuss how long we did due diligence on it. Suffice it to say, we [due diligence] on it long enough that we got comfortable with it. But to the point in your question and it's a good question. I think the thing we focus on are the quality assets, as I mentioned, the likelihood that we can be repaid and the likelihood we can get a nice return for our shareholders. That's really a focus. And the point I was trying to make earlier, and thanks for asking this question is, is we're a little indifferent as to whether it's a royalty structure, a loan structure or some combination of the two.

And when do you think you might be -- when do you think you might be able to announce another deal and then start seeing more revenue from it?","Well, we don't know when we'll be able to announce it, but we have been approved on a couple already. One very significant one, one that I referred to in the -- during the January, February time frame when we raised money. So that one's -- that went through an RP process and we've been given the green light there. And then we have 2 more we're working on. They're also very substantial deals.

And so we had a lot more change in our schedule there. And I believe that’s going to continue through this quarter, so it’s a little bit more difficult to forecast. But at the same time, I want to also give ourselves a credit. This year was really hard to forecast the whole year. But I was just looking at my notes, internally, when we had a – in June time, we had a detailed review, we had a sales meeting and we look at what we going to ship in next two quarters, and we were in the $5 million. So we’re able to – there was a lot of changes in a product demand, but overall we were $5 million up.

Or were you just doing them to kind of drive share gains?","I'll let Tony -- Tony runs that business for us but I would -- one comment I would make about the mobile business is we were early in that. There are a lot of new entrants into it, but we continue to be uniquely positioned in terms of our retail footprint and our refurbishment capabilities. And our play is how do we continue to leverage that and bundle it with video game promotions. But Tony, you want to talk about mobile promotions and trades and so forth?",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Were you pressured to do more aggressive promotions there, which may have impacted mobile margins because of more competition in the space? Or were you just doing them to kind of drive share gains?","Yes, absolutely. I think the #1 issue that we continue to face is awareness of that. So new entrants actually drive awareness of the overall business, and that's a very positive thing for GameStop. So we did not see an increased amount of discounting in that. We did -- as Rob mentioned earlier, we were very aggressive on the trade side of the business. But we see it as a very complementary business. We see it does bring in some new customers, but a lot of the customers that do come in and buy mobile are the same customers that are coming in. Obviously, we wanted to build inventory for the large amount of holiday traffic that we expect as we sell a lot of new consoles this holiday season.

And then as far as your Chinese testing goes, you have been talking about this for a while, but is there any progress at all, are we really just waiting for final regulatory approval?","Yes. I mean, we have progress, so we will continue to ship more units into three or four different MSOs over there. So this Access business is typically go pretty slow before they really take off. Based on the current kind of calendar that we are looking at from an approval standpoint, I think we will know a whole lot more if they're going to really going to go rush [ph] on this until latter part of 2010.",2.0,0.0,0,1.0,0.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then as we look into '12, and you've talked about this a little bit on the call, but is there a growing challenge from numerous excise tax increases in different markets? Is it more of a challenge than maybe expected at the beginning of '11 as we looked out to '12? Is there any kind of comment you can give to that?","Well, excise taxes are a challenge every year. They are the single most important factor playing into our business. We have had a year, 2009, with 2 surprises; '10 with 5 surprises; '11 with 1. And now we have had recently one for Turkey, which will go into 2012. We have managed through those in the previous years, and I really think that we will be able to manage through 2012 as well. Bad news can always happen. However, thanks to our global footprint, we have always been able to balance the unexpected bad with unexpected good. So I think that should be the case going forward as well. That's simply the advantage of such a broad global footprint as we have it.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
NAFC,Q4,2007,Okay. And then do you have any plans yet for retail openings or closing this year?,"We don't. I mean we obviously have these two Albertson's stores that will be incremental to the store base that we have. We review that not even just by quarter, we review it by period to see if there is anything that makes sense in terms of stores that where we have got a lease that is expiring or store that is underperforming. We do have a store where we've got a lease expiring and to be honest the profitability in that store just isn't worth renewing the lease, so we expect that in the second quarter we may close one store, but it's a small store and we haven't advised all the parties involved yet of our intentions to do this.

GGG,Q1,2015,"Okay. And then finally from me, the translation effect here is a bit worse, as you called out. When I look at the organic growth in industrial and process, it doesn't look obvious that there's been any transactional effect, like losing out on sales versus just translating those sales back into fewer dollars. Are you expecting that? Is that something that we ought to be watching out for? Or is that a smaller issue here?","Yes, I view that as a smaller issue. Generally in the past, we haven't seen that be a dynamic in the marketplace when currency shifts. It can shift to maybe on a project-by-project basis, but I think generally from the larger view of things, the end market pricing will remain stable.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

And then finally, there has been a little bit crackdown on checking for social security mismatches, and I was wondering if that’s something that affected you at all.","Well, that’s been going on for couple of years and our operations periodically will receive a list from the social security administration saying that there are some mismatches and we work with our partners at those locations. Those partners are our employees, to try to help them resolve that situation. There certainly have been a few situations where the employee was using false identification and they are no longer with the organization as is required by law.

ASEI,Q2,2014,"Okay. And then if I look at the cash deployment, there's about, what, $20, $21.50 of cash in the balance sheet. And I know you've been repurchasing shares, and you have a nice generous dividend policy. But as I kind of look at repurchasing as we go forward, in your thought process, I mean, are you guys concerned at all about the float that's outstanding and the availability of shares? And kind of -- are you going to continue to buy in to that or buy back stock into that if the opportunity presents itself? Or have you considered other cash deployment options?
","Well, I think -- obviously, we do -- we are aware of the float issue and the conversation there and balancing that impact, but we do have a matrix in place that establishes what amount we purchase at which price levels from that standpoint. It's been a challenge for several years. It's a great challenge to have. But I mean, there's only so many places we can go with the cash.

Is the DIRECTV and the EchoStar business done through those two customers that you mentioned for CSS?","Both of those are DIRECTV suppliers. Now in the case of WNC, they do both MoCA business and CSS business.Now, we also supply CSS to other people besides DIRECTV, some of the international satellite deployments.

TWI,Q4,2017,"Okay. And then in terms of I guess gross margins on the ag side of things, could you just maybe walk through some of the puts and takes; mix, price cost, how you’re thinking about it heading into the year?","I’ll jump in first, Jim, and then you can add on. With gross margin, Joe, we are seeing a mix that’s improving in the back half of the year. The first half of the year was really driven by the small and midsize market. We’re seeing the large products start to move better which is a plus for us as we continue to grow volumes which we did in '17 and then into '18 as well. We’ll see the plants get more efficient. We’ve been hiring. The only headwind we face right now is just the training cost of getting people up and running and working effectively in the plant. So at all our locations we are hiring. We have been hiring and will continue to do that and we’re getting them adopted into the plant as quickly as we possibly can, so we’re pretty efficient at doing that. But there is obviously a learning curve of two to three months before you really get somebody operating at a high level. So for the business overall on margins, I think economically just fundamental it’s going to continue to improve. Where we got to watch things closely is just the balance between pricing and cost with raw materials and then where you can pick up some additional pricing power as the markets go in a favorable direction compared to where we were over the last few years. Many times you have a prolonged downturn – multiyear prolonged downturn, it gives your customers a chance to really focus on their costs and in turn they’re going to find ways to put suppliers against each other. And so that’s the market [Technical Difficulty] see that change. It’s not going at a game-buster level where you also then have pricing power flipping all the over. But we are going to continue to look very closely at how we price our products, where the demand is increasingly compared to the supply in the market. We’ve been focused on pricing for a while and we’re going to continue to do that. We even got a two-day meeting set up for next week that’s just about pricing. So I think on the fringes, you continue to get better on your pricing versus your cost, again assuming that raw materials don’t have any hiccups like we did in 2017. You put all that together and you keep driving some margin improvement in that direction. Again, I think the big headwind for us though is just bringing in headcount. Whenever you’re doing that you got some costs you have to absorb. But other than that, that’s a positive. Once you get a trained workforce in place, now you’re really running, you’re getting some improved volumes going out the door.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
ENTR,Q4,2009,"Okay. And then in terms of Verizon, can you walk us through a little bit of – I know you have had a quite a bit history now with them. But, in terms of quarters where they have done massive promotions, is there kind of a take rate that you guys – kind of a lag period that you see before the promotions really start to kick in terms of your business? Or is there correlation we can make with the promotion history?","Yes. I mean generally, if you just look at sell-through, net subscriber adds, we typically get a one-quarter lag before we get an impact on our business and we have seen that in the last couple of quarters. There have been kind of (inaudible) in terms of net subscriber adds. So, it would really be a June quarter impact to figure a pretty big spring back this quarter in terms of net subscriber adds. They seem to get pretty immediate feedback from the barely new promotions because they start getting sell-through associated with that pretty quickly. So, they seen kind of a medium impact and then we seen it like a one-quarter delay.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
SYKE,Q1,2015,"Okay. And then in terms of margins, you guys have got into the low end of the targeted range, Is this a sustainable margin range? Or is there something that was helpful, particularly in terms of the hedging benefit to the margins that might not necessarily imply that we should just model it at this kind of a base line going forward?","From a margin standpoint, yes. Yes. And we were really pleased with the Q1 numbers. We got surprised by the volume increase. We delivered lots of increased EPS. But going by quarter three last year, we were close to 8% at 7.8%. We blew through the 8% to 10%, well we were 9.6% in Q4. We got to 8.1% in Q1. We clearly have got a weak quarter two, even though quarter two this year is going to be a year-over-year improvement and that will make eight quarters in a row if we achieve that. We do have a weakness there. And if you look at the implied guidance for the second half of the year, again within that 8% to 10% range. So absolutely we are knocking on the door. There is no special one-off that impact in Q1 that was not operational and just delivery. So we really see ourselves as right there and what the exception is clearly Q2 still has a bit of work to do. In terms of the demand cycle, we have got combined with softness in the communications vertical we spoken about, we see that as being still the biggest job to get each of our quarters towards that 8% to 10%. We don't need to Q2 in that 8% to 10%, but we certainly can improve it the mid-five that we were talking about just now.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Or is there something that was helpful, particularly in terms of the hedging benefit to the margins that might not necessarily imply that we should just model it at this kind of a base line going forward?","Shlomo, there isn't anything particularly like a one-off or anything. We are very, very close in just running in the zone. Q3 last year 7.8%, Q4 9.6%, Q1 8.1%, Q2 ironically just being low and it was low last year. That is not a structural issue, although I guess, if you all hear me talking about this for the next two years, I would have to tell you it is but at this point in time, this has been a strange occurrence of events that happened in Q2 for two years back-to-back. But I think as you see the year progressing, you will see that we are pretty much, when you look back and probably when we end 2015, we will probably look back and see for the last five quarters, six quarters, we have been pretty much in the range with the exception of the Q2 time frame. So I would ay, as you are modeling going forward, just to keep in mind we were at 5.8% in 2013, we came in 7.2% I think 2014, we are guiding here around 7.5% for the full-year what we are looking at. So we are pretty much getting into that zone. And we still have with the Americas utilization at 80%, we still have a little more room there to gain on some of the facility rationalization. We really like that to be at 85% to get into the zone. So if you look at our trajectory, it is probably safe to keep it in that range.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
DGII,Q3,2018,"Okay. And then in terms of professional services 2.7 million for the quarter. It seems like it’s a multi-quarter high. Just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing there? And if that looks like it’s a sustainable run rate or just given this business is lumpy, that we shouldn’t kind of forecast that out going forward?","David, thanks for pointing it out. We do expect services to continue double-digit growth rates, there is two big elements, there is a professional services element, our wireless is on services group has really performed well both in this quarter, but also in trending. What is nice is they are being associated with Digi products more and more as well and so they are ends up being an effect that’s just beyond just the professional services revenue, but helps our customers adopt Digi products. The other big portion of that is our enterprise software and we are seeing higher take rates associated in particular with our cellular router business that includes revenue from both our Accelerated and Digi side of the product lines, quite frankly Accelerated take rates on enterprise software are higher than Digi take rates. But that’s having a positive influence on Digi’s ability to connect and get that recurring device management and enterprise software revenue. So we do expect that revenue category to continue to grow.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GIS,Q1,2015,"Okay. And then in terms of the merchandising, I guess, one question I would have maybe just going forward. It just seems like you’ve got a lot going on. You launched 145 new products in the first quarter. You’re going to be changing some of the merchandising tactics on some of your other brands. But is the lack of lift or sort of the efficiency of the merchandising and maybe this is a more general question. Is it tied at all to -- there is just generally most of your -- the industry is trying to do more, trying to merchandise more or launch new products to try to stimulate demand. And retailers just can't execute all of that merchandising effectively. So it sort of dilutes the intent just simply because they’re trying to do too much?","So Bryan, you kind of summarize the number of comments that we made in June on the merchandising environment. And there is more kind of merchandising and promotional offers now seeking what is a limited display space in the store and that is an environment where I think, I should question sort of points out quality can suffer. You see more offshelf kind of pricing. You see more ads without an end isle or you see lots of products at the end of the isle. So there is lots of activity seeking relatively limited space and that’s why for us it's important. First of all that we focused very much on how we execute these events and the brand that we promote and do everything we can to make sure that there are sort of must have promotions. And there are other consumer things that accompany them to make them appealing. So our execution is very important for us in this environment. And as well as just constantly looking at what we do, did it work, what was the ROI and if something didn't work or tactic doesn’t work to apply the same HMM stuff that we do in all of the rest of the business, apply those and get rid of that kind of promotion and try something else. So it is an ongoing process of review and evaluation, making sure the execution is of the highest level because it is a very competitive environment out there as you point out with your question.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then in terms of your overall business in Asia, it's obviously doing quite well even excluding Japan. It appears, in general, the economy and consumers are faring much better in Asia than the rest of the world, especially when we look at your margins. Excluding currency and acquisitions, I think it's up -- they're up almost 10%. So hoping you can again just drill down a little deeper, maybe give us a few more details on what the key dynamics are here, specifically in Indonesia and then Korea, maybe long-term growth rates you expect in those key markets.","Yes. Indonesia -- Asia, overall, as I said on the prepared remarks as well, is the growth engine of our company, but Asia -- it's not Asia alone. We are also having very decent results in the other regions. Take the EEMA region. Take the Latin America region, but also take the EU region, where we have returned to OCI growth. So whilst the growth rates are the strongest in Asia, the business is doing very well also elsewhere. Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia.

ENTR,Q4,2009,"Okay. And then in terms of your visibility or backlog coverage for the current quarter, do you need to do any turns business to get your guidance and typically what kind of lead time you get from Verizon, if you don't mind me asking?","So within the current quarter, we have really good visibility. We have several lot of [ph] turns business, but generally we have great visibility in the current quarter. Part of our turns business is because we are in the Motorola hubbing program. So, we recognize revenue on so out of the hub and so into the hub. That creates some level of churns business for us. Also, our chain of business have some level of churns component associated with them. But generally, we feel like we have really good visibility in the current quarter and we feel that way about this quarter as well. As far as Verizon goes, Verizon isn't a direct customer. They (inaudible) with guys like Motorola and Actiontec and Alcatel and people like that, and then those are our direct customers. So we typically get like a 12 month rolling forecast. We have 16-week lead-time that we quote to our customers. They usually don't kind of filling out of those, but we usually have pretty big coverage to our lead time. So generally, customers are pretty good about at least giving us 12 to 13 weeks sort of thing. Am I [ph] right, Dave?",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
AAPL,Q2,2009,"Okay. And then just a follow up on the iPhone for Tim, perhaps, you guys started with Wal-Mart I think towards the end of December last quarter and your sales came in probably higher than most people thought. How much of an impact was Wal-Mart there and then what was the channel inventory in the iPhone as you exited the quarter? That’s it from me. Thanks.","In terms of Wal-Mart, and as you probably know, they’re a very key partner for us, relative to iPod and we did expand through them for iPhone coverage and we believe they do provide us extended reach in areas that we weren’t heading before. And we’re pleased with the results there thus far, but it’s in the early going and so there is not much to report there yet. In terms of total distribution across the world, we are selling iPhone now in over 50,000 storefronts in the 81 countries, so we have a sizeable presence and sizeable channel in the space. In terms of channel inventory, if you remember last time – last quarter, I told you that or implied that we had about 1.75 million units in inventory and to remind you in case you guys have forgotten, we are very conservative as to how we count inventory. For example, we count demos that aren’t sellable in inventory and we have about 100,000 of these 50,000 locations. We count units that are in transit from our factories to the carriers that are not physically available for sale and at the end of a quarter, at the end of the last quarter in particular that was around 100,000 units. So just to put your perspective – to put some context and perspective on now, we also in many cases count inventory all the way to the storefront. I think there are many people in the industry that that count units as sell through and seize to count channel inventory beyond the distribution center, it’s just not the way we look at it. We like to be very disciplined in this environment. So on your specific question, I’m not going to talk about weeks, because we don’t frankly have the experience headed into this quarter about the seasonality given this will be our first June quarter with a – with a sort of a worldwide spread. But we sold the channel inventory in the countries that we were in at the beginning of the December quarter fall by the end of the quarter. But with the countries that we added which I mentioned before, we added a net of around 80,000 units and so we ended at 1.83 million units. And again that includes all of those categories that I had mentioned earlier. Net-net, we’re very comfortable with the inventory and we have people running more of it.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then just a quick follow, when Shannon was asking about inventory levels, will you have some catch up in inventory levels in supplies market for both inkjets and laser jets as you look at second half.

Thank you."," Even after the earthquake, we put the past priority to drive the consumers to the customers, because that is our duty to so.

But I'm wondering about Ukraine as well, which had strong growth in the quarter. Does that reverse in the fourth quarter, i.e. is the third quarter impact undone? Or does it just normalize in Ukraine?","Ukraine is now normalizing. Q3 of this year, actually, in terms of comparison benefits from a very weak Q3 of last year. Q3 2010 had to de-load after the July 2010 price increase, which had a load in Q2 of 2010. So therefore, I mean, we are benefiting in Q3 now from these relatively easy comps. And we are now kind of out of that, and we should see now a situation that normalizes in the Ukrainian markets. Let's hope that we have no new disruptions, nothing on the horizon.

I think, we are feeling pretty good about where we have come from over the past say three and half quarters, in particular the German situation. Now in addition to that though we have seen slightly stronger than typical demand at this time of the year in Europe too, so having that little bit of wind at our backs is certainly going to help our business too.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
NMRX,Q3,2013,"Okay. And then just further question I got on the for 4Q outlook, trying to understand that the breakdown between the subscription and hardware. You gave the guidance on the full year hardware and if I took that to just kind of the 8% level for the year, filling the fourth quarter there, it would seem to imply flattish subscription revenue from 3Q to 4Q, which doesn't seem particularly logical. So just wondering, do you expect to see a sequential increase in your subscription revenue in 4Q versus 3Q?","Yes, we definitely do. And we expect that increase in service revenues, and we also expect a -- clearly, an increase in year-over-year increase in hardware revenue. So we just gave you as much guidance as we could. The 8% growth from the hardware puts us at, I think, a low -- probably a slightly lower level but, again, we did say that we've conservative guidance on hardware. Because of it's sporadic nature, Rich, we just -- we don't like to give guidance on hardware because that's tough to...

TECD,Q4,2008,"Okay. And then just lastly, when you speak with your vendors are you seeing any changes on their part their view of the channel, are they trying to extent more of the larger resellers direct versus through the channel or vice versa?","No, first of all, Rich, I would say that every vendor has its own story, based on their products and their perceived optimum coverage model. The good news is I think most vendors today acknowledge that IT distribution is a lower cost variable cost relative to market model that they can deploy. And so when times get tough and they look to go to lower cost models, they turn to distribution and they see our value, they appreciate our ability to execute and to cover larger chunks of the market.

Now, I wouldn’t say that there is a wholesale move towards IT distribution. It really is a vendor-by-vendor dialog and that’s why we talk in both Jeff's comments and in my comments about the depth of the relationships we have with vendors. We were able to sit with them and understand their challenges and their perceived weakness in coverage and the cost and expense issues they have, and we are able to map out our value against their challenges. And when we do that we clearly deepen the strategic relationship we have with vendors. So, as I said in my comments, I believe during these difficult times there is an opportunity for Tech Data to strengthen its relationship and its position in the markets and we are actively engaged in both geographies with those strategic dialogs with our vendors.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"Okay. And then just maybe one follow-up. You guys I'm sure get a lot of the same questions in terms of the potential decline in the amount of UNIX to Linux opportunity there is out there. I guess, when you looked at the fourth quarter numbers or you look at it over a 12-month basis, I guess is there any real -- I guess everybody is thinking there's some sort of ledge that we're coming to. Do you see any real, I guess, risk of that over the next 12 months? Or do you still see that as a pretty fertile opportunity for you all?","I -- well, I mean I think the healthcare deal we talked about is a great example. While we've done a lot of work replacing UNIX in areas like financial services and in telecommunications, if we look at mainstream verticals, we're still in the early days with a lot of very large companies who are -- kind of walk [ph] on the late majority. And that makes up a big, big, big chunk of the UNIX footprint out there. Those are also typically for us a little bit higher price points as people are looking for kind of the higher levels of service and our higher levels of subscription. So I don't think we see at all right now any slowing in that momentum. It's just a move from the early adopters to the kind of late majority in terms of the customers that are now making those migrations. The good news for us is they're big.

As you also look geographically, I mean, U.S. is down 15% and Europe was up a little bit which seems a little bit counterintuitive in a way, Asia I believe being up 34% quarter to quarter, that makes sense. But anything you can attribute to the different shifts you have there both geographically and sort of where end markets of those are coming from?","Yeah, USA is more competitive in the last two quarters. Especially when we have a hard drive high price appraisal. And another fact I believe because our FatTwin– our FatTwin is really remarkable architecture, and we also experienced some customers they're waiting for that. The good thing is that product line is in production now finally. So that we have our performance in this quarter, December quarter.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
CTAS,Q1,2008,Okay. And then just on that last point. Can you help me understand exactly how the economics of that work around selling the paper on the back end? And how much of the profitability comes from that? The business nicely profitable without that or can you give me any metrics to help understand that?,"We won’t provide metrics on it obviously, but we can tell you is the way it operates is not only are you picking up a very saleable commodity. So you are turning back around either bailing it at room side or selling into recycler and when the demand for that product is very high like it is currently, you are essentially covering a lot of cost by selling that paper. Though it’s very, it’s positive at this point in time and it's a… we believe, we will continue to be positive.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
PDLI,Q2,2012,"Okay. And then just the last question, I'm familiar with Merus. What other assets does it have? Is this still purchased from Novartis as main asset, or are there other interesting things in this portfolio?","At this point it's main asset, Phil. These are folks -- what they're doing is they're trying to build the company, they're looking for similar size asset by big pharma spin-offs, products that are reasonable stable and revenues reasonably mature in their life upon which they can build the business and I think that's -- they've been pretty public about their aspirations.",1.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0
VRTV,Q4,2018,"Okay. And then just to be clear, payables in 2019 is an expected tailwind after being a headwind in the fourth quarter of this year -- of last year?","Steve is shaking his head and said, yes.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
CTAS,Q1,2008,"Okay. And then kind of different way, when you look at your different product lines now, what product like do you think stands the benefit most from Project One Team?","I think out of the gate first, it’s the other services emerging businesses because you are bringing a lot of customers to that with Fire and Document Management especially, Fire. If you have a lot of customers that we have that you can use that service when you have thousand business customers, most of this are in a rental business as you know. So, I think out of the gate those emerging businesses should have the best opportunity, but we also believe this new sales organization… for the fact that we talked about previously are going to benefit all of the divisions.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
UHS,Q2,2012,"Okay. And then last question on the non-controlling interest, how should we think about that sort of from a modeling perspective going forward? Is that on a pure dollars basis?","Yeah, as everybody I think knows, the most significant item on that non-controlling interest line is the minority interest in the Vegas market. And, as Darren I think and others have asked about, that’s a market that’s been soft, I think that part of our reason for revising guidance is an expectation that at least in the short run it remains so. To me, the current run rate in that market, and therefore the impact on that line is probably as good a guide to at least the next couple of quarters than anything else.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
KONA,Q1,2013,"Okay. And then last question, can you just comment anything else that you can give us on kind of comp trends during the quarter and kind of what you have seen as weather has improved recently?","And we are expecting snow in Denver in two days, so the day that we hate to use weather as an excuse, but the day that kind of stay clear and nice days we see significant improvements year-over-year, so…",1.0,0.0,1,0.0,1.0,2.0
KONA,Q1,2013,"Okay. And then last question, can you just comment anything else that you can give us on kind of comp trends during the quarter and kind of what you have seen as weather has improved recently?","Mark, I think kind of we gave guidance of 1% for the second quarter and that kind of takes into account what we are seeing to-date. We actually get the benefit from Easter moving out of the second quarter, but then also with weather we have seen a little bit of both. We have seen some rainy weather, especially in Texas in some of the Midwest markets, and even I think upcoming there is a lot of rain expected in the Minneapolis, Chicago market began, so…. So, yeah, I think we are seeing better trends in Q1, but definitely we are not clearing out of the wood. So, 1% comp guidance we feel is something we can obtain for Q2.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
DGII,Q3,2018,"Okay. And then lastly back to the large pharma opportunity when that you announced last quarter you haven’t provided a name, I’m curious if you are able to speak who that customer or provide some indication, the size or scope as well as the expansion opportunity with different products or even geographies?","Yes. I would be more than happy to provide the names I could, I can’t for confidentiality reasons. What I can say is that we began implementation last quarter, it does continue into this quarter, we feel like we will be substantially complete with that implementation by the end of our fiscal year and it is a multi-1000 unit deployment as I mentioned earlier. Our ability to execute those large widely distributed types of implementations are really - it has really become a competitive advantage. It’s not just the product and the offering, it’s not the price, it's not just the remote support, but our ability to train and to implement cost effectively is a real advantage for us.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
VCEL,Q3,2017,Okay. And then lastly for me and then I'll get back in the queue. With regard to sales force expansion is 40 sort of the right number now that you have essentially full access in payor coverage and how should we think about the trend in potential sales force growth going forward to the extent the demand continues to pull through?,"Yes. Thanks Kevin, it's Nick. For the time being, we do think it's the right number. As Dan mentioned, there were a couple drivers, one is that with increased expanded medical policies, it opened up some geographies where we didn't have good Carticel coverage in the past, so that was sort of an easy one. And then as you think about a sales force expansion, obviously there's a larger universe of orthopedic surgeons that we would like to reach with the appropriate frequency and making sure we can do that in light of increasing workloads being driven by increased by biopsies implants et cetera. So it's a combination of all of those factors, increased medical policy better region frequency on our target universe, and making sure that we can do count the work activity for our sales reps.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,1.0,1.0
PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, looking out now in the EU over the next several years, how comfortable -- how confident are you that you can grow your operating income in that market over time in light of the fact that presumably, there's going to be a difficult economic backdrop? There'll be, presumably, government austerity measures. The governments will certainly be looking to increase excise taxes as a source of revenue.","Okay. I mean, there are, of course, the markets that we know already, like Spain, which are already in difficulties as of today. However, there are a couple of positive aspects to the EU business, really, because you asked the question in a longer context, in a 2-, 3-year context. First, it is really encouraging to see that we see clearly moderating total market declines. So in the quarter or in also year-to-date, we talk about 3.6%, 3.7%. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, half of that is just Spain. So, i.e. all the other markets together are declining not even 2%. Germany is growing. France is stable, and Italy is almost stable. So that's pretty good. What will the austerity measures do? Well, the point really is what will unemployment do. We have seen that, of course, a steep increase in dramatic levels of unemployment, like in Spain, have an impact. I do not see Spain happening everywhere in Europe. This is very overdone. I don't think that's going to happen. So then on excise tax pressure, could be. Of course, I can't exclude it. But given the financing needs of those governments, I would rather see pressure on general VAT increases. In Europe, those could happen, of course, affecting all products, including our products. That being said, a VAT increase has always been manageable at the end of the day in the past. Why wouldn't we be able to manage it -- to manage through these occasions also going into the future.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
ENTR,Q4,2009,"Okay. And then lastly, as far as revenues go, this amount of revenue growth you have seen these last two quarters, Q4 and Q3, well you are projecting Q1, do you think you are at risk of some lumpiness with inventory build-up, or do you think that this (inaudible) is going to help you see sequential growth throughout the year?","I will not provide specific guidance on the current quarter. I would say, generally if we look at it from a market standpoint, we should be growing throughout the year, because we're ramping into new deployments. The Verizon business seems to be kind of at a bottom from a run rate standpoint. So if we do get any kind of movement there, it's going to be upside movement. Currently, the way we're looking at, that's kind dampening in our growth a little bit because we kind of happen to grow through some software in the Verizon business. But if you look at the other MoCA based service provider deployments, we have multiple log in there, all kind of in a ramp stage. So we feel pretty good about the future from that standpoint.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then lastly, circling back on Turkey. It looked like, from news reports, that PMI took basically TRY 2 per pack price increases, more than you needed perhaps in low-price but not enough to pass it through in premium. On a portfolio basis, is PMI roughly whole? Or is there a negative impact from simply not being able to pass through all of the increase in the premium segment, where PMI is very strong?","Well, I think I said earlier, if you have brands at the very lowest end of the market that have an allover need of TRY 0.7, whereas it's TRY 3 around at the premium end, then it's no longer a mathematical exercise and you have to protect your entire brand portfolio, which is what we did. But as I said earlier, I would still hope that there could be a second step in that story later, because the rational arguments are clearly on our side.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
GIS,Q1,2015,"Okay. And then maybe a question for Don -- you or for John about the cost savings coming through this year. So with little softer sales in the first quarter, I know you kept your guidance in place for the year. Do you now expect a heavier degree of cost savings may be along those if you could -- I know we have $400 million, I think of HMM savings, $40 million overhead savings, so are there any project entry savings that have come through this year?","Minimal projects entry as John said, we’re going to be starting that effort this year. We’ll see significant savings starting in ‘16. We’re not making that a great deal this year. It’s mostly going to come from our overhead efforts. And obviously there is the ongoing both HMM efforts that we see within our COGS, within our overhead expenses. First, when we you start the year like we have, everyone is tightening their belt a bit from an admin standpoint. And the one thing I would notice is that we did see growth in our media support. So that's one area because we have good ideas to drive growth in some of our key segment and some of our key platforms. We haven't cut back. What we’re doing it is really an overhead in some of those project areas we discussed. We’re still targeting the $40 million for this year and it would be something larger in F‘16.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
WBA,Q4,2019,"Okay. And then maybe just follow-up -- or second one. On the pilots, I know it's a little unclear when they're going to swing positive, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is the main concept of the contribution from those the LabCorp, the VillageMD, the stuff with Optum and Humana, is that foot traffic? Is it your percentage of the earnings of those entities themselves? How's the company going to benefit from those ventures?","A.J. I think just one additional thing. The here was quite important particularly in pharmacy. So, we are really looking to see -- convinced that having a general practitioner in a pharmacy alongside a pharmacist working together not only drives additional prescriptions and a wee which is completely legal, but also provides better patient care. And that combination will lead to new platforms in the future we've spoken about as we look to not just provide a digital care, but also digital care in the community.So, again, its early days, but we are very excited about this idea of doctor-led and pharmacist-enabled including that partnership going forward in that model, yes.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
WBA,Q4,2019,"Okay. And then maybe just follow-up -- or second one. On the pilots, I know it's a little unclear when they're going to swing positive, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is the main concept of the contribution from those the LabCorp, the VillageMD, the stuff with Optum and Humana, is that foot traffic? Is it your percentage of the earnings of those entities themselves? How's the company going to benefit from those ventures?","It is a mix. Yes, it's a mix. Each one will be slightly different, but you could envisage that a fairly standard one would be -- there'll be a rental contribution because we're giving up space in the store. There's probably some element of a share of the total business that the supplier does in that case the partner does in that case.And then arguably the most important one is the foot traffic benefit where we have quite sophisticated models in the case of existing types of businesses. So, we know if there's a primary care. That's why we're testing these pilots. We're trying to see the uplifts on both retail and on scripts. So, you've got three sources of income in most cases.And when we say there isn't a contribution the FedEx agreement delivers favorable contribution already and we're already at full capacity basically. Already LabCorp on an income basis is positive. What's negative is we're investing capital every time we touch the store. So, it's more a cash flow negative. Some of these are neutral to positive already, but as we roll out the 600 LabCorp stores, there's capital being expanded to reset each of the stores.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
OSUR,Q3,2020,"Okay. And then maybe just one last one if I could sneak it in. On that understand that there is some of the kind of time line dynamics that have adjusted. But when we think about running some of the trials in parallel, does delaying the professional test maybe push the over-the-counter or the prescription self-test closer to that initial time line? Is there any chance where you can kind of compress the gap between the two as you've had more time to develop some of the data and fine-tune things? Or is it still kind of the same sort of lag here that we might expect as you go from one to two to three?","Well the lag period is somewhat in our control as you can imagine with the design and resourcing of clinical trials, but it's somewhat out of our control because of course FDA makes the final call on the EUA approval process, right? So we're doing everything we can to ensure that there's minimal time between the EUA submissions and hopefully the approvals. We have evolved our thoughts thinking a lot about what it will take to accomplish these clinical trials and we'll make the investments we need to ensure that we shorten the time as much as possible. So I think that's been an evolving set of priorities for us since we spoke at our second quarter earnings call back in August. And so I think we're in a very good position there to minimize the amount of time overall and control what we can control.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
RHT,Q3,2013,"Okay. And then maybe just one, I know it -- I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here on OpenStack. But, Jim, I'd love to know when we think of RHEL and what differentiated RHEL in the early days, you obviously had some support from some big players like IBM. But you did a lot of certification for workloads, and I think that really was a big piece of what differentiated RHEL. As you think about your flavor of supporting OpenStack, what do you think can differentiate Red Hat's position?","Well, certainly, I think a certified ecosystem is important. And one of the things that we have been uniquely successful doing is building enterprise versions of open source products on which people, whether those are hardware or software vendors, can certify. Recognize certification happens on bits, not on code. And so having an enterprise version on which people can certify is important. We're quite good at that. We're working very closely with a whole series of partners on our OpenStack certification program as we speak. You'll hear a lot more about that over the coming next several months.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
SXC,Q1,2014,"Okay. And then my last question is just housekeeping. I know you're pushing some corporate overhead from the parent to the MLP, once you do all your dropdown, how much corporate overhead is leaving the parent and going to the MLP, do you think? If you could provide that.","And lastly, the right time to do it is when we consider dropdown transactions, because then the MLP, the complex committee as they approve a transaction, both costs are included in evaluation. So it's absolutely the right way to handle it and the right time to do it.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
SXC,Q1,2014,"Okay. And then my last question is just housekeeping. I know you're pushing some corporate overhead from the parent to the MLP, once you do all your dropdown, how much corporate overhead is leaving the parent and going to the MLP, do you think? If you could provide that.","Sam, it may be a little bit too early to comment of that. I think what we would like to do is as we think about the parent without the operating assets, we want to get to something that's more nominal than what we retain today. Obviously, today, the retained corporate overhead is approximately $35 million. We're taking steps, as Fritz mentioned, to reduce that in view of selling the coal business. And then further, we've done a pretty in-depth assessment as to where we're spending our time, vis-à-vis, the operations and the GP, and really what we're trying to do is do a fair rational allocation of cost and reduction of cost, so that when we get to a parent that has no operating asset and you look at the retained corporate overhead, it makes sense.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
DOV,Q2,2008,"Okay. And then on Triton, I mean it's been struggling for the last couple of years now. I mean why... I mean, I am sure you are now aware of that, but why this quarter? Why do you pull the trigger this quarter?",I think we have a viable buyer currently in place that allow us to move the process forward. And we're taking advantage of that opportunity and this just happens to be the time that it was all in place.,2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
BGS,Q2,2014,"Okay. And then on some of the stuff you talked you talked about Dave, I think we have done some stuff on the non-GMO side, just within Pirate's and then I also think Polaner brand. Can you talk about how these initiatives were received by the consumer and any impact on costs on those initiatives as well?","Well the first audience we are doing this for is, isn't necessarily the consumers, the retailer. With the Polaner brand and with the snacks, we are trying to establish a point of difference with the Polaner brand to Smucker's preserved business. We actually tried to do this 10 years ago with the Polaner raw fruit line and say it was a non-GMO line and got called up by the FDA and got a nasty letter telling us stop doing that. World has changed, so now we are able to do it again. Too early to tell what the consumer responses, that's rolled out into distribution and we will see how consumers respond to that. On the snack side, we think we are going to have a much stronger and more immediate response, simply because people like Whole Foods, as you may probably know, have put out the edict that the product in Whole Foods will be non-GMO, and to the extent that Pirate's was not non-GMO, pretty much as we were taking the business over, Whole Foods stopped supporting our promotional activity -- at Whole Foods, until we transitioned to fully non-GMO product, which we have done as of the end of June, and we are running that product through the natural distribution channels now, and we would expect to get stronger promotional support from our natural food customers as a result of that, and therefore do more consumer sales as a result of that. So we have done the good work in terms of making the Pirate's line fully non-GMO for the natural channel. We still have a regular product line that's out in supermarkets that is not fully non-GMO, but we have addressed the concern from the natural channel point of view.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
UHS,Q2,2012,"Okay. And then on the behavioral health side, obviously a very good trend there for 18 months or so that were above average is I guess the way we looked at them, which sort of came back down to earth a little bit this quarter. Can you point to anything in particular what they have changed and I guess what is your long-term growth outlook for that business at this stage?","Yeah, I think Tom that we have said a number of times that we think that going forward a reasonable growth rate, revenue growth rate in the behavioral division is probably in the 5%, 5.5% range and we have been pretty consistently meeting those targets. We were a little lower than that in Q2. As we looked at the detail of it I think we identified a number of facilities where because of ongoing either new construction projects or ongoing construction projects to convert residential to acute beds, we had to close down some capacity and we think that cost us maybe 50 or 60 or 70 basis points revenue growth in the second quarter. So I think when adjusted for that I think we feel like again that sort of 5%, 5.5% growth rate is reasonable, and the other piece is that beginning in July of 2012, the severe Medicaid reductions that we saw at this time last year of 3% to 4% moderate to something like flat to down 1% and so that’s a helpful comparison as well.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
PLNR,Q2,2012,"Okay. And then on the last question, the large orders that were pushed out are those set to return in Q3?","We have captured couple of them already, and we have more than we are working on, it's just for whatever reason we had seen kind of pace of closing of deals in the second half of last calendar year, that when January rolled around. It just slowed and people took more time and things got delayed and couple of them were big projects that are linked to construction projects that had some delays. So, we are continuing to work those. We did not see a lot of losses in the quarter, and the big opportunity, most of them were delayed and so while I’d like to say yes everything is right back on track, I’m a little hesitant just because the last three months has thought us that the things are little bit slower than they were maybe six months ago. So, we have seen a couple of them come in already, we are working them and we are hearing good news about them, but we are being a little cautious about going out (inaudible) before we get them.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
BBBY,Q2,2019,"Okay.

PLNR,Q2,2012,"Okay. And then on your visibility, what are you seeing heading back into the back half of the year, what’s giving you confidence in being GAAP profitable by [two quarter]?","Well it's really all about getting the revenue line back up to higher point and as it relates to moving into this quarter, we started the quarter with a little more backlog as some of the orders we did get last quarter were for shipments in this quarter and so we entered this quarter with more backlog than we had last quarter. And we have seen the early part of the quarter order rate to be little stronger than what we have seen in the past and so, we are starting to see the orders come in to support an expectation of some higher order rate. And then on top of that as I mentioned we do have a couple of new products that will begin shipping here in the second half and so opportunities for that which are in general additive to the opportunities that we are working on now should enable us to grow the revenue sufficiently to get up above the breakeven point.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,1.0,2.0
DOV,Q2,2008,"Okay. And then one more question just on the 12% plus growth guidance. That's on the new continuing ops number, correct?

PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then secondly, Hermann, is the excise tax increase in Turkey the single most challenging one you're going to have to endure, looked at over the last several years, taking into account sort of the nature, the magnitude of the increase, the relative importance of the market, your performance in the market and so on?","Well, I mean, no, I wouldn't say that. It is, of course, disruptive, a disruptive excise increase. It is bad news. But a year ago, we have been discussing Mexico. I wouldn't make much of a difference between the 2 at the end of the day. What I would add and say on Turkey, well, I mean, this -- the excise increase is, of course, a problem for all the competitors. This excise increase is not benefiting the government. I'm convinced about this is not generating really for the mid- and long-term solid increased revenue base. The only one party benefiting from that would be people that sell at the very lowest end of the markets, which is not the international companies, at about TRY 4 per pack, because at that level, their allover need is only 1/4 of what it is at the premium end. This doesn't make sense for the government either. At the same time, we, of course, can expect now a steep reaction -- at least in the first months, a very steep reaction of the tax paid markets. We certainly can expect an increase in the illicit rate. These are all really straightforward, rational arguments which give me the hope that there could be a second step later in the process in this story.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

I mean how does that evolve, how is that $0.03 net evolved on over the balance of the year?",I think we have high confidence.

I mean how does that evolve, how is that $0.03 net evolved on over the balance of the year?",I would say that we anticipate continued progress when we talk about the original $40 million to $60 million over two years. That mathematically comes out to somewhere around $0.13 to $0.20. So we picked up a penny in the first quarter and $0.03 in the second. I would say you are likely to see something on the same order magnitude in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Markem-Imaje will continue to be one of the principal drivers of that process. But there is a lot of activity in the same arena going on in other places like the Pump Solutions Group.

","So typically, we see good design wins and we see good evaluations and basically good customer feedback to show with the new products or gaining traction.

I know that that's much more retail oriented than Avid is but can you talk about qualitatively what the margin structure is there and does is fit in with the Avid strategy or is it really a separate silo?","Okay, I think it's a good compliment overall to our consumer electronics strategy and when you take a look at the overall CE market what we've done in particular here in North America is really rounded out that offering with DBS. We've got out of it on the very high end home theater. We have got a lot of product in the IT and CE convergence space to our core Ingram Micro business.
DBL really does provide... I guess... provides us with I guess a couple of things: number one is it does fill in a lot of the accessories part of the CE offerings, some related to convergence, some not. And in addition to that it also brings us a lot of strength and independent retail. So it's a good mix, it's a good compliment to what we already have in product line. I think it's a great compliment in terms of the customer sets we are able to address and operating margins we didn't talk specifically about but as with the other adjacent businesses we've looked at obviously we are looking at net new markets that offer us with higher margin businesses both on the gross margin as well as operating margin lines.

PM,Q1,2016,"Okay. And then the other question on FX was just when I looked at your guidance for the full year, the $0.15 favorability, there's some favorability on the yen movement, but it seems like some of the hedging that you put on also limits some of that impact. So, can you just remind us where you were hedged on the yen and what that impact would be for the balance of the year if you sort of look at the effect of yen?","Well, we had – well, at the beginning of the year, always when we give the hedge coverage, we're about a 70-or-so percent. So clearly, I mean, there might be a moment – and we always hedge, as you remember, 12 months to 18 months ahead. So, it's not 100% of the yen positions or cash flows which are hedged for this year, but a very, very significant portion of the yen projected cash flows are hedged. Maybe what's going to – what will help you is that some of the hedges are executed in the form of calls and put options, right, the collar option strategy, which not necessarily have to have an impact if we see the development of the year of the yen going outside the bracket. And only some of that is done for the forwards, okay? Forwards, obviously, you can't walk away. But with that collar options, you have some flexibility, so you can take an advantage of what is the spot rate can be.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

And then the – just looking at the breakdown of the $5.3 million in costs that was identified, I think you said $3.6 million was, was that purely of Shoals startup costs I may have missed that?","Yes, now that was a combinations but we haven’t broken out and we’re not breaking out the Danville call it, the Danville is idle currently, the Danville carrying cost as well as the Shoals startup cost. We haven’t broken those out, but of the $5.3 I think it was $3.6 in total for those two items. And the Shoals’ items the larger of that two and as I said, the Danville one drops pretty diametrically with the asset write-down, the impairment that you’re at.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

And then kind of that third one, are you looking for that to be kind of an early Q1 opening next year?","Yes, for the third one, we are looking for a Q1 opening. As it relates to the two restaurants in Q4, we are committed to open them during the fourth quarter. So far we should start construction fairly soon and we have relatively aggressive construction planning anywhere from 140 to 148 days give or take.

And then turning focus to the European acquisition, moving forward, I mean, should we expect this to be a real foothold that you would relatively consistently look to a acquire your way throughout geographically… throughout Europe? Or is it rather this is kind of a just a toehold and you could let a half a year or even a year go by as you begin to understand the culture and financial dynamics of working over there without doing another acquisition?","Bruce, I would say we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake and get too aggressive over there. But on the other hand, I would tell you that we are… we have got a list of potential candidates for acquisition and if we can meet with the sellers at reasonable prices, we are not afraid to acquire a few more operations because we have a lot of confidence and the management team that came with us, with the acquisition in the Netherlands and we feel that, if we find the right opportunity at the right prices, we will certainly move forward.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then when we think about the modern multi-channel strategy, you've announced a few months ago that you were going to close 200 stores in the U.S. Really when you think about the strategy that it's shaping out, when we think longer term over time, what is the type of the infrastructure? What's the size of the store infrastructure you think needed in the U.S. compared to existing?","It's Alex here Ricky. We don't see a lot of change. I've always been of the view that we can have roundabout 10,000 pharmacies probably more than we have today, although at different formats. So the format that we have today is really you see that a suburban drug store or the urban store that we have in the big cities, we're developing a small store pharmacy. We got about I think 30 or 40 now actively in the ground. And we're pleased with the results, lower cost more focus on pharmacy and OTC health care and obviously pick up as well. So we're developing that format. So we still got opportunities to fill in some networks.And going forward -- and I think also remember there are 65,000 pharmacies, thereabouts, in the U.S. today and they're coming down in number. So we believe that our efficient supply chain, the strength of our brand and the quality of our pharmacists and the support they're getting through the new IT infrastructures and digital capabilities we're investing in that we will be able to improve not just the efficiency of the pharmacy, but the quality of the care that we provide to patients and payers going forward and have more percent of the pharmacies in the U.S. over time.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

It's up to them to come back to us in the coming months and that's really something that's not under our schedule.

I would say, we don’t have a definitive plan that we want to be certain size in any particular period of time, but we are very aggressive in trying to understand the market over there. The management team that came with this acquisition is very well known on continent in this business and therefore will be very helpful to us as we expand.

And then you sort of mentioned this when you talked about consumer versus professional and education, but would you say that you’re seeing any signs of stabilization in the consumer market that some of the other tech companies decided in recent weeks and with that in mind, can you comment on the linearity of the quarter and what you sort of saw on a trend line basis as you progressed through the quarter.","Yes, Bill, we’re not – we are not economist and so we are not entering the game of predicting bottoms and that sort of thing. We will report our results and give a view of the next quarter. But if you look at the different product areas, which is the way that we think about it, if you looked at the iPod linearity through the quarter and you overlaid last year, you would see very little difference in the two curves. We were up 3% year-over-year, and so very, very similar and not much to mention except for the point I made earlier that from a mix point of view, the iPod Touch is the runaway hit and it’s clearly being driven by the App Store that we spoke about earlier. On the Mac side, as I mentioned earlier, our sells, our unit sell through had accelerated in March after we turned every desktop in the company on the same day. And so March is a very important month for the Mac business. When you look at the iPhones, the iPhones linearity to the quarter, it was reasonably linear business after the first week or two; it was very little up and down in the aggregate. Obviously it’s a new business for us, it’s the first March quarter that we’ve had rolled out to significant number of countries and so we were exceptionally pleased to see that instead of the normal seasonality curve that one would associate with most consumer electronics.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
ACAT,Q1,2012,"Okay. And then, Claude, could you give us any comments on Europe and just the broader trends there? We’ve seen declines from other categories, but I wondered what your take is so far this spring?","Europe was a – first of all, was a very good year for us. Our entire international business was good for us and so, when you’re talking about Europe, whether it’s ATV or snow, on the snow side, they had good weather. The markets you’re talking about, Finland and Sweden, the northern markets really weren’t/aren’t as impacted as the rest of Europe, such as the southern part of Europe. And so on snow, we had a very good year.
On ATVs, we also experienced very good growth in European markets. Italy, Spain are not big countries for us. The big countries for us France, Germany and then, obviously, Norway and Sweden and countries up north are big as well. So, today, we haven’t seen any kind of impact. Last year, we saw a major pickup and I think as we look at Europe for next year, we’re being somewhat conservative in terms of what we’re expecting from them in terms of possible growth.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then, Dan maybe just to help with modeling some of the overhead expenses, can you give us a number on what you think overall SG&A is going to be including Sargent in 2016?","Yeah. I think it's – we'll be closer to around 15.5% to 16%. But our assumptions haven't changed since what we presented to you about a month ago, when we announced the deal. As you know, we're just in the process of preparing or beginning balance sheet valuations with our experts to make sure that our assumptions that we did give everybody are correct. So I think when we report our first quarter earnings, the first week of August, everybody will get a good view of what we have on the books in the way of amortization and interest and debt deferred amortization cost.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
ROLL,Q4,2015,"Okay. And then, Dan, I guess you talked about the accounting of Sargent and you talked about the SG&A in 2016 being 15.5% to 16% of revenue. And historically when you make acquisitions, the SG&A ticks up, I think the last one was up about 100 basis points. Is it because of the size of this deal that it's not or is it because of the mix, it's aerospace and therefore you are actually seeing a decline because, I guess, it's been running around 17%. So, you expect it to fall?","Well, their SG&A as a percentage of sales runs a little lower than ours. Until we finalize beginning balance sheet, find out where the amortization is falling to depreciation, we're not going to have a good number to give you until we talk again in August.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,"Okay. And then, Hermann, just following up on David's question about EU region. I guess just in terms of the persistent market share losses that you've been experiencing and obviously, more the macro challenges and the fact that you're more exposed to the premium segment than others, are you rethinking sort of your brand portfolio strategy in any meaningful way to be a little bit more aggressive in some of the value segment? I think you talked about this a little bit at your analyst meeting, but just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about sort of share versus maybe a mix or profit in that region.","I mean, we certainly want the EU region to return to OCI growth. Now in the European context, we have seen a number of markets, their brands over the last years have been repositioned to the low end. We have answered that in the markets, where it was necessary, this brand out of our portfolio. I mean, Germany is a much different situation than it has been a couple of years ago. We have Marlboro there. Yes, but we also have today there an L&M, the fastest growing brand in the market. The market -- the brand with the highest young adult smoker share in the market, and we are right now complementing that with Chesterfield at the same price level in the German market. Taken all together, well, the market share in the German market actually has been growing. So our team there, and we have a very strong team in Germany, is doing an excellent job, and it begins to pay off. If you move over to France, that's a different situation there. There, actually, we have 2 growing premium brands. Both Philip Morris and Marlboro are doing extremely well in an otherwise stable market. The market where we are underrepresented at the low end, clearly, is Italy, where our share at the low price segment of the market is well below our overall total market share in the market. So it's a marketing, it's a brand challenge. It's a sales challenge, but we have the portfolio to do something there. And it's not that we wake up to it now. We do something already for the last years.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

TER,Q2,2014,"Okay. And then, I guess, just to follow up here on the buy rate on some of your slides. You're saying the buy rate this year for SOC is only about 1%, which is significantly below where it was in '10, '11 and '12. Did something happen industry-wide? Or is it just dynamics of a single year?","Well, I think there's one factor that needs to be put in there. So yes, it's up this year from last year. It will be up 1%-plus. But the buy rate in the past had effect of some large microprocessor companies were buying significant commercial capacity. They tend, at this point, to move in-house. And so that was in the commercial market numbers in '10, '11, '12, and it's out of the commercial market numbers that you look at in '13, '14 and beyond. So if you -- and that could be on the order of several hundred million dollars of buying. So if you neutralize that effect of shifting from commercial to in-house, I think you would find it's back not quite to that 1.3% level, but it's getting back there.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

There's been no halt to 787 ramp-up at all. I know they have the issues with the battery and like, but there's they've been no impact that I've been able to ascertain, and that's the feedback we're getting from our customers as well.

So, I guess to one of the earlier questions, the reason you’re not expecting more orders that come in, in 2014 that you can deliver in 2014 as because most of those orders would be outside of coal in Shoals. Shoals is already a full capacity which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500 because as half of the 7,000 you expect to be delivered, are all those things sort of roughly correct?","Yes, I think definitely roughly correct and when we look at the coal market that’s where Danville would be the type of cars that would go in there, and the visibility there just isn’t there and Shoals were being cautious on what we can expect there given we’re in startup mode still.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

PM,Q1,2016,"Okay. And then, in terms of Russia, I was actually hoping you could drill down just a little bit further on your business there. You took a price increase in that market. So I guess I'd like to hear the impact of that as well as then your expectation for possible share gains in this market? And essentially your outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of Russia?","I mean, I will start with the total market. I mean, the first quarter, again, as many quarters of last year came pretty strong on a total industry size. I think 6% is clearly on the low side of one could expect from the market. We have a 20%, 23% on a weighted basis, price increases. So clearly, the elasticities are still on a – what I used to call attractive side, i.e., minus 0.3, minus 0.5, somewhere in this territory. So that's good. Market share, I mean, it seems that this year we are a little bit faster than competitions with rolling out the prices, or maybe actually competition is a bit slower versus us in lowering of the prices. It's presumably a more appropriate description of the situation. Look, Russia also compares this year versus pretty strong share advancement last year. So 20 basis points, 30 basis points sort of a share pressure. I mean, it doesn't really disturb us dramatically. I mean, that the more important it is that the total volume of the industry somehow seems on a stronger size, relative again to the price increases. In our portfolio – and the downtrading in the market, so our brands' performance and the downtrading in the market, I mean, it goes frankly speaking in line of – what we would be expecting. It is not – we don't see acceleration of a downtrading. You have this medium to value segment sort of one share point to – up to two share points year-on-year fluctuations or difference there. I mean, our brand's performing in their respective segments pretty strong. So I think the outlook in terms, again, on the profitability, which I guess is the most important at this stage, I mean, is pretty positive. And yes, we might have some sort of occasional share pressure, but it is more as I said also in my remarks, it's more the timing of whose products going to hit first the market with the price increase.

And do you see yourselves getting priced out of some business that you could see volumes picking up a bit more as pricing comes down?","Yeah. So, let's clarify, John. I do not believe I said that the cost reduction would lead to lower end prices to our customers. That is not the plan at all. In fact, we believe that we've got opportunities for margin improvement in the business over the course of time due to both inflationary factors that are impacting the business and our ability to better manage price just by having a consolidated set of systems. One point of truth, I guess, is one way to look at instead of two or three. So, we are not speaking to lowering prices in the marketplace at all. The cost reduction initiatives are broad-based just because of the enablement that the integration has given us. That come from process improvement, which leads to lower operating cost, lower headcount costs that should be part of the benefits of going through the integration.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,1.0,2.0

I mean, I don't know if I have a change in profile there. I think that there's a – when we look at the interest that we're incurring throughout the year, we incur more when we have our seasonal borrowing, which is coming down pretty rapidly right now.

ENTR,Q4,2009,"Okay. And with relates to kind of the next wave of MoCA and beyond, multi-room DVR, it seems like MoCA as a technology really cornered the market here in the US But kind of the IP delivery side, I guess there is kind of other technologies that have started taking off, it's WiFi et cetera. I mean, what needs to happen or what and when it needs to happen, do you think that MoCA really starts going into that next phase?","I think that this is specifically in the over the top video delivery service market so as multiple components in the third wave of growth. The first one is kind of the over the top opportunity, the second one is the move of traditional pay TV service providers from the current video delivery mechanism, the modern IP-based video delivery, and then the third components are really international. So, on the over the top feeds, I think you are seeing WiFi as being kind of the predominant technology out there today. We are really in the early adopter market for that part of the business and I think the focus right now in over the top pay TV service providers is first and foremost to get their application embedded in as many consumer electronic products is possible. So if you look at the Netflix streaming service as an example, they are now in PS3, they are in Xbox 360, they're now even in Wii. Vizio [ph] announced at CES that they are now in most of the major branded TV manufactures, with the exception I think of Panasonic and Sony. So that's kind of the first and foremost objective is given in as many platforms as possible. The second thing that they are focused on is to get the consumer to at least use the service once. And as it turns out, if you include WiFi as opposed to just including an Ethernet jack, the attach rate of people actually trying the service at least once is about 2X. So, WiFi definitely provides that immediate benefit of saying, okay, somebody is going to try the service, at least use it and see how it goes. The disadvantage of WiFi is really going to be evidenced as you start moving through the mainstream part of the market where the quality expectations of video are basically set, and the bar is set by their current incumbent pay-TV service providers. So, just start having more streaming sports content and more things where people have a quality viewing experience get us back on the use of services, unless you have a high quality FatPipe that delivers the video quality very reliably. I think that's going to take a couple of years and that's when MoCA really starts to get additional traction. We did start having initial conversations with TV set manufactures. These are obviously confidential customer discussions, so I can't mention customer names, but where TV set manufacturers are starting to come to us about plans to embed MoCA in TV sets over time. In a similar timeframe, we see the potential of incumbent pay-TV service providers like DIRECTV with our view moving to more of the same client architecture which also has the potential to push MoCA into TV sets, and also in a similar timeframe like in Northern Europe, where there is coax infrastructure and Europe will really lag the US in both DVR and HDTV deployment by a couple of years. We see an opportunity for MoCA to deploy there. So we see multiple things happening that drive that with the biggest factor being this IP video distribution and the need for quality of service.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Okay. And with that said with that point I believe in the past you've always talked about long-term model as kind of mid-60% product gross margin, should we now assume that we’re trending to that level quicker than what previously maybe you would have thought given those incremental investments and if so when do you think we should maybe think about mid-60s rather than the 68% you’ve been running out?
","Yes. So, I think we expect the competitive environment to continue. Certainly the discounting and pricing environment we are currently in. Our long-term target for margins, for products is in the 64% to 66 % range. We still are comfortably above that. Our margins and products are about 68. We think that this will trend down a bit over a time. Our support and service you might have noticed is going up. So to some extent it's offset out on margins over all.

So it looks stable. However it's really early in the quarter. Aaron, so we tempered our forecast with some of that. Because again if price decreases happen again and again we're still susceptible to that in our inventories. If price is maintained stable, we're going to be okay and then if prices go up, we may see some benefits. So again it's very early in the quarter.

I was wondering if you could talk about, we’ve seen inventories down significantly at a number of department stores. How would you characterize the buying environment or the availability of product and also the driver of your own inventory reductions per store with the strong comp?","In terms of availability, it’s pretty broad-based and spread through all the markets.

First of all, just the availability, I’ll let Barbara comment on that in a moment. But in terms of the inventory in our stores, that’s driven by our own plans. We tend to plan our inventories with some discipline, just to make sure that we can drive turns if the sales trend is strong.

UHS,Q2,2012,"Okay. As you did mention earlier you have some CapEx projects coming – that you are starting. But obviously you took down guidance in part because you are concerned about the economy and that kind of things. How do you balance those two things, the desire to invest for growth down the line versus kind of what you are seeing right now as a weaker demand profile? What’s your thought process there?","Well my general sense Kevin is that CapEx decisions tend to have a longer term perspective to them than operating decisions. So we I thought had very good cost controls as an example in both of our business segments this quarter as we reacted to a more modest revenue growth environment and we react very much in real-time to those kinds of changes. As we think about CapEx and particularly as you think about bigger CapEx, building a new hospital in Temecula, building a new tower at Wellington or adding beds in behavioral, those I think are much longer term decisions and I think we have to think beyond just the current economic recovery and just the market position and what we view as the long term projections in a market and that’s how we do it. So I think that’s why you see sort of more immediate changes in our operating cost structure and less immediate changes in our capital planning.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
UHS,Q2,2012,"Okay. Back on the acute side, I guess, I’m seeing here, again cost control wise you guys have done a good job. I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen someone post a negative same-store revenue growth in acute business, but obviously you had a very tough comp a year ago. One of the things we’re seeing from some of the other guys is as they report soft in-patient volumes, it seems like they are getting a little help from revenue per adjusted admission being somewhat stronger and the argument that at least it’s being made is that the soft volumes tend to be in cases that have lower revenues associated with them and therefore it’s not impacting the overall revenue growth or 3%, 4%, 5% revenue on a same-store basis. It doesn’t seem like that dynamic is a play here in your case, I just wondered if you had any thoughts about it in terms of where you’re seeing the softness in the volume and the revenue per adjusted admission being a little sort of flattish or only slightly up.","Yeah, so I think if you look at the difference between our admissions or unadjusted admissions and our adjusted admissions, there is a measurable difference which obviously implies that our out-patient revenues are growing faster than our in-patient. So we are certainly experiencing some of that same shift that you’re alluding to A.J., that I think the other companies are referencing. What it does also highlight however is that the unadjusted admissions that is really the straight in-patient admissions are rather weak and remain rather weak and we think that’s largely a function of these sort of very difficult economic conditions in certain of our markets, most notable Vegas and South Texas. But I think that’s the major explanation. I think other than that we feel like – as we look at what the other companies are reporting in general and directionally we’re experiencing much of the same trends.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
AXGN,Q2,2018,"Okay. But I guess as you've probably going to gather -- you might have already gathered, I mean the results in the quarter of 36% was below the -- at least 40% guidance which you've reiterated several times this year. And I guess just try to again gauge this level of that that we can get back this distraction in the distributor side of your salesforce has been rectified and as you look into the third and fourth quarter, how do we get comfort as people on the outside that you can actually return to that level of growth? And the follow-on to that is given that this has now happened in this segment of our salesforce, how do you -- how does this not happen again? In a sense, how do you get these people perhaps more engaged or does this take you then having to perhaps go direct in more segments as opposed to relying on distributors?","Well, first off, I'll focus on the 80% of our revenue, which is really the direct channel. So, that's a portion of the business that we have clean and direct control over. And that's an increasing part of our business. Doesn't mean that we are going to be a hybrid model. The reason we think we want to be a hybrid model over the long-term is because their trauma is by design geographically spread out. And there are some selected trauma centers that are very good trauma centers, but they're geographically difficult to reach and maybe not concentrated enough. Examples are Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, parts of South Dakota. There are trauma centers in each of those locations, but no one of those in our current call pattern is probably large enough to put in a direct rep, at least at this point. And so what we're really doing is right-sizing what we consider to be some of our independent territories to say we definitely want strong partners in those locations. But in other areas where we may not be getting the focus, we're going to continue to divide out some of the territories and transition to direct reps. And you've seen us do that over time while the number of independent agencies has stayed about the same actually over the last year. The amount of trauma centers that they cover has actually gone down because we've been dividing out their territory and that's where some of the base has come for many of the direct reps that we've added. And that continues to be our strategy. You can see that we're planning to add some more reps over the rest of the year that will come from dividing either distributor or independent agencies territories or are direct territories. We still also plan to continue to split territories when they approach $2 million revenue number on any unrealized basis. We think that is where you might start to see some dampening of growth and that's obviously our goal is to continue to drive significant growth. And so we don't want to have that, so we set the expectation with our direct team and do execute such that we split territories when they are somewhere between a $1.5 million and $2.5 million. So, with all those things combined, I think we're in a good spot having addressed these. We won't eliminate all of our independent distributors, but we will be less reliant on that portion of the channel as we continue to grow.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

I mean you called out Belvac, it's not that big a business, but it sounds like it's pretty challenged right now. How is how is product ID doing organically?","Organic growth for product ID in the second quarter was 4%. Most of that most of the organic growth, or most of the growth, I'm not sure I can split it regionally on organic growth, but most of the growth that we experienced in the second quarter was led by Europe, Latin America and Asia, and North America was a bit flat but organic growth for the quarter was 4%.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
AVNR,Q4,2013,"Okay. Can you just remind me, -- we are actually looking at the old DPN data earlier today, what -- why was that not pursued?","Yes, I can jump on that, Thomas. Thomas, it’s Keith. So originally when we had designed this program and focused on MS pain, it was a number of years ago before we had AVP-786. And at that time, we weren’t certain about what type of intellectual property we would have to be able to support a DPN pain indication that would -- give us the runway that we needed in order to fully develop it.
So, we decided to focus in on MS pain because we believe that there was a good possibility that we get orphan drug status and that we can build that into the overall development plan and time it accordingly. With the in-licensing of AVP-786 that obviously has changed our entire perspective and that’s how we spent a fair bit of time in our Investor Relations Day in October talking about we had already made up our mind that we were going to move towards -- back towards diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain because of 786.
So I think these study results just further validate that belief and that approach that we put out before. That said, we need to look at the totality of the data where we just got the study results. So we have to go through and see how it can inform the program but by no means do we think that this is the end of the pain program.

CTAS,Q1,2008,"Okay. Fair enough. And finally, just a quick one. Your press release mentioned the FIN 48 and accretion of tax liability. Could you explain what’s driving that or what the issue is around it?","Sure. It’s actually with FIN 48 you are required to essentially analyze your tax reserves and has to be based on technical merits is to whether or not you can have something in your tax return that is separate from most on your financial statements. Based on that review, we essentially took our deferred tax liability, and if you look at the balance sheet, you essentially have that liability that was emplaced at May 31 and that has been broken down to the deferred tax asset and the accrued liabilities mainly in the long-term accrued liabilities, you will see that of the flip side portion of that come through essentially. And there was a $14 million additional reserve that we established through retained earnings, which is really based on the competition on technical merits of FIN 48. And so, I think when you go through that merit, you will see that that is essentially just a move from that deferred tax liability as of May 31 up until.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

We obviously did look and try to understand and there really wasn’t anything specific other than the matters we sort of mentioned and then you’ve seen the pickup in October. We just haven’t seen it and – basically for us it was obviously we initially looked at it and said – looked at directionally but basically once we saw the numbers coming back in October, that obviously gave us a lot more comfort. But basically we think that you go back and you take into account the chemical issue which was an unexpected issue and the currency where it is. I mean the business is doing much better as I indicated, the sales are up and the numbers are up in local currencies, up over 60%.

The main difference there is on the far northwest corner of the play, there is some acreage that we'd actually acquire from EOG that we let expire and then we do have some acreage we double counted, but the biggest thing is we dropped some acreage on the far northwest corner.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
VRTV,Q4,2018,"Okay. Got you. And also in the lower volume outlook you have for 2018 in Print, aside from the industry volume declines, are you still adjusting some of your client base going forward as well?","Yeah, we are doing two things, Judy. We're adjusting the client base for high-risk accounts, primarily around debt. It doesn't do anything good to sell to them if they don't pay us, simplistically, and so we're more aggressively managing that. And for a number of reasons, we think the industry is not getting healthier and with price increases from manufacturers coming more and more into play, there could be even greater risk. So we're trying to be proactive to address that. So that could have impact on revenues.
The other thing that we are also adjusting is, we're making some choices on the product portfolio as well. For example, we are in the wide format space, print wide format print. And in the last couple of weeks, we announced that we were exiting the plastic portion or the non-paper portion of wide format and that will put some pressure on the top line as well. Now, the reason we're doing that is because we don't believe that we have the right to win in that space, whereas in the paper space for wide format, we do believe we do. And so, it's a strategic choice that we made. So it's a choice around both optimizing the product portfolio to get it to a sweet spot, as well as making customer choices to derisk the business.",2.0,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,2.0
GCI,Q3,2013,"Okay. Gracia, a couple more smaller ones, I think. Do you -- is there a perceived opportunity in terms of mobile ad sales you feel developing with the USA TODAY and the tablets and smartphones?

You mentioned Shoplocal or DealChicken. Are some of those ones that you think will have -- play an increasingly large role as time goes in?","Let me start with the mobile question, and anybody that would like to jump in, feel free to. We see enormous opportunity in mobile and especially at USA TODAY but really across our entire set of businesses. USA TODAY has put up some phenomenal increases in mobile users and page views and in all the mobile metrics that make it just an outstanding vehicle. And we see opportunities certainly arising with our ability to monetize mobile in a much more meaningful way. And so we're continually working on that both at USA TODAY as well as, frankly, across all of our mobile platforms, whether they are in broadcast or in our publishing side of the business. So just a huge opportunity, we believe, going forward and something that we're carefully working on. I will tell you that the area that we're also focused on is video because video right now carries a very attractive eCPM. We have increased our video views across the company in an extraordinary way, and we have a lot more that we're doing in that area. And we see some opportunity there, especially having a very expanded broadcasting business, together with our video production center down in Atlanta, to really be able to maximize the video opportunity in a much more meaningful way over the next several years.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Let me take the first 2, and then Dave will talk about spats since I apparently don't like to talk about spats. With respect to approvals, obviously, as we all know, the government was shut down for 16 or 17 days. That included the FCC and the DOJ. I assume that they're getting ramped back up after being offline and not checking e-mails and all those wonderful things. We are doing everything that we can, obviously, internally to close the deal, as we previously have indicated. It's not obviously entirely in our hands. We don't control the FCC or the DOJ or what their lineup is right at the moment, given they were not on track for over 2 weeks. But we are moving as expeditiously as we possibly can. With respect to Aereo, as I've mentioned before, we just believe that there's been lawsuits all over the place. Some have obviously been very favorable; some of them have been unfavorable. I think ultimately, as we've said, we suspect that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide on it, but we continue to believe that the copyright laws of the United States of America should prevail. We believe that when we provide content that we should be paid for providing that content. I think that underlies what's happening in retrans and underlies what we've done with our all-access content subscription model.

SYKE,Q1,2015,Okay. Great. And can you talk a little bit investments that Sykes has made in security or privacy of client information? And what are you hearing from clients in regards to that?,"Yes. Security is something that is top of mind for everyone. I don't think it's just even our industry. I mean it's the world and it's kind of sad state of affairs when you comment on it. I can tell you personally when I look at the amount of money that we spend and the amount of money that we continue to spend, it is definitely a new item on our P&L that has emerged over the last five years. I don't know if I see it at this point in time dramatically increasing. The thing that is changing for us as a company is the level of sophistication that our team has built internally.

But security is one of those things that I don't think you ever really want to tout how good you are, because I think we are learning in the market, the synergy to figure out once they, you know somebody figures out something else. So it's going to be a challenging area. But we think, as a company right now for us, the security is everything from your protocol that you put in your hiring processes to your facility, physical security to your network security. Even as simple as clean desk policies.

There are certain human capital strategies that we are deploying and the way that you interact with your people. We are serving predictive technologies now that we are starting to deploy. There is a lot of masking technology, I call it masking where you can protect the customer service professional and the customer from exchanging credit card information, social security numbers, whatever those things maybe.

So from a technology standpoint, I think the world will keep up with it. Typically the security issues boil down to people and I think that's going to probably always continue to be one of the bigger challenges. But for us right now, it's something that is both -- it's a concern. I think about it a lot. But at the same time I think we have some pretty good discipline in our presentations. I think it can be, for us, it's a little more of a differentiation. But it's something we are going to have to watch, Frank, for a long time.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0

Can you give any insight on targeting on laterals, especially in McMullen there?","Well, as you know, Noel, we do spend a lot of time staying in zone.

The business is still immaterial from a dollar standpoint. It's doubling sequentially. I think it's really driving from a model standpoint what we've laid out. It's the opportunity to go back is to, frankly, anybody that is – that is a long time Citrix customer, but the most value being added, of course, those that have converted to the cloud and layer on unique insights, not just as one more monitoring tool, but there's things that are really driving more autonomous actions to help drive a better security model, better performance model and all the contextual attributes that we've talked about. So you can see the pricing out there and kind of draw a picture back to what the overall TAM is. But over time, this could be a really material business, and that's how we're looking at it.

And they were just posting today, in fact, on LinkedIn, about their use -- their commercial simulator to accelerate their design license from the NRC. But simulator, in fact, is based on GSE's technology. We've been working for them for at least a decade now. And so the short answer to your question is, yes. And there's just a tremendous story behind just that. So long before these plants are built, they need to simulate those plants as they design them, and then prove they can operate them safely.

And then other question is I wonder if you guys could walk through the best case and worst case scenarios for the litigation when we could see the first generics and what your plans are? Thanks.,"Sure. Hi Roy, it’s Keith. So in terms of best case which is the case that we fully expected to be the outcome, the judge will -- will issue a ruling from the bench and that ruling will be in favor of Avanir and allow us to continue the promotion of the NUEDEXTA and helping PBA patients through 2026. Worst case scenario would be that after the judge rules against us, in which case the drugs would be allowed to enter.

NMBL,Q3,2016,"Okay. How long does a company and the Board pursue this strategy before possibly considering other strategic alternatives? In other words if you -- another couple of quarters margins don't improve and indeed pricing persists which could cause ongoing pressure on the business, how long does the company look at that before deciding perhaps make different strategic choices?


","At this point I think we've given you a sense for how we are thinking about our business model which is the investments we make will bring us into the same sort -- will impact our leverage in the first half of this year and the second half will improve our leverage. The reality is that from a cash perspective so far this year, we have essentially generated cash. So this is a business that is not burned cash all through this year. When you look at some of our competitors and you contrast our approach to cash management it's extremely prudent. We are not anywhere close to abandoning the prudent approach to managing cash and so I don't feel like we're taking undue risks. These are well understood investments that we know have a good return. So, I think at this point that is really the outlook on how we want to operate our business model.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

","So, Keith, this is Anup. I just want to add something that Suresh said in terms of the confidence in the leverage in the model we are going forward. So we talk about the time to maturity of sales team that we bring on board, just to give you a perspective. So, less than 60% of the team that we have on board are actually in the mature category.

VRTV,Q4,2018,"Okay. I appreciate all the details. You had also mentioned one of the factors for the first quarter being pre-buy ahead of some of the price increases. Was that because contracts are resetting in January due to higher inflation? If so, what some of the inflation that got passed through, or if it's just pushing prices a little bit more organically you like maybe with some of the drivers are there?","Yes. So let me speak to what price increase is first of all. There have been several supplier price increases announced that were to go into effect in the first part of the year, as well as we announced, I would characterize it as an inflationary price increase on two parts of our business where we have higher cost to serve. As a result of that, some customers decided to pre-buy and so the pipelines are quite full in particular in the Print business and some -- we saw some of that in Packaging as well, but it was very specific in the Print business.",2.0,0.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
SWN,Q3,2012,"Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up, looking at your gas price outlook, Steve, obviously sub-$5 with constraints on even the potential for more activity as prices go up and the power generation switchback. I mean, how do you look at the Fayetteville in sort of that light if -- I don't know what your sort of near-term look is the next, say, 3 years? Where do you see activity there at the 400, 450? Do you kind of maintain your activity that you're doing right now on the Fayetteville, or would you increase that at a certain price point?","I think from just a strategic standpoint, we really started in 2011, trying to keep the Fayetteville Shale within its cash flow with a thought that in the not too distant future it could generate excess cash flow to apply to some other things. And we do have a large backlog of wells to kind of what price we have out there. So I think as you look into the future, we will increase or decrease well count based on basically how much cash flow comes out of the Fayetteville Shale. This year, we're drilling about 400 wells. We're not quite balanced. As we look into the next year, I can tell you we'll start the year running 7 rigs. And if you ran 7 rigs all year that would be in the 350-type number well range, again, depending on how fast you're drilling those kinds of things. So we will adjust it. As price gets higher and there's more cash flow, we'll drill more wells on the other side, but I don't know how much lower we'll go from where we're at right now.

We issued approximately 1.9 million shares for approximately $6.9 million net cash.

TWI,Q4,2017,Okay. I guess I must have misheard you. I thought you were not able to pass the rubber cost increases through without price increases.,"Just the first half of the year. If you look at the chart for natural rubber going back to the tail end of '16 into early '17, it spiked rapidly. So if it had done a gradual increase, it would have been less of an issue, but it didn’t. It did one of those runs up the mountain that’s scary to look at. And it was just driven by primarily speculation going on in some Asian markets. So that’s why it wasn’t a supply-demand imbalance, so that’s why it was able to correct itself in the back half of the year. But again, if you just pull up our natural rubber chart, it does the hockey stick and it’s ugly to look at. And the way our business model is and the way tire manufacturers is they’ve also expressed since that moment – we just don’t have the ability to absorb those – well, we have to absorb the cost but we don’t have the ability to pass them on that quickly. And so basically everybody had to face absorbing those costs more so than what we could pass on. But it hasn’t happened that – that hasn’t happened that often out of blue. It’s happened before in commodity cycles where rubber cost increased that quickly, but this one came out of the blue with natural rubber and again it wasn’t driven by supply-demand and the world went back to normal fairly quickly.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Helping us win more right within automotive, helping take our product development path and consider where else we can use it in the market, and I think that's where, Jay Freeland, our new Board member will really help us think that through.

Actually I thought one of the encouraging, albeit mildly encouraging dynamics in Q2 was that, I thought that the length of stay reduction decelerated a little bit, but I think to your point Gary, and my sense is that just as we talked about rates, Medicaid rate reductions is decelerating in July of 2012, my sense is that length of stay contraction should respond the same way because it quite frankly is emblematic of the same sorts budgetary issues. But I think it remains to be seen.

And so can you just talk about some of the mechanics of this on the gross margin, how we should think about it?","Sure. So for the quarter we took a charge of $194 million. As that inventory clears through, any markdowns associated with that inventory has already been taken from a P&L perspective. But we also have inventory that we’ve been focused on from an assortment optimization perspective included in this write-down that we’ll have to work through the process over time, which will take us about 18 months or up to 18 months to clear through that merchandise and be able to present a crisper, fresher point of view from a customer perspective.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I think there is some potential upside there that they should be able to find over time, whether it be pricing or whether it be internal initiatives and the synergy programs we're working on.

What this is, we buy firm. Typically on a pipeline, you're buying long-term firm. In this case, there were operators who can't supply their firm. And for short periods of time, some of these contracts we have are 6-month type contracts. And all we're doing is buying from operators who couldn't use it.

If I could have one follow-up, in terms of the great comp number you put up this quarter, do you think about the upside, perhaps, where your expectations were three months or six months ago, is more of the upside coming from the packaway product or the regular flow?","It’s a combination.

But they generally are fast followers. And the customers tell them, ""Do what LitePoint did. Do what LitePoint did."" But they're not starting with the best architecture to do that, so they have to make trade-offs. And often, they have higher COGS in their product.

We don't anticipate any significant change or improvement in that through the course of the year. I would also point out, though, Scott, even with those challenges, we have been doing significant things behind the scene to improve our cost base in that business.

I know, you’ve had some extraordinary expenses, perhaps, in the last couple of quarters, but we do expect you need to get about 2.5 million now per quarter to breakeven.","That's a great question. I believe Ceci mentioned that at the tail end of our comments, our breakeven has been relatively consistent through the year. It's about 7.5 million on an annualized basis. So if you were to break that across the quarters, right, it's less than 2 million, but it's in that range give or take and it really depends on the mix and you're right also about the extraordinary expenses. As you know, we spent quite a bit of money over the last really 12 months positioning ourselves for the NASDAQ listening, including expenses to get on the NASDAQ and so forth. So those are not recurring and I'd like to see actually I do believe that our expenses are going to decline again. We went through a significant period over the last four or five years where we were able to keep our expenses basically steady or declining and grow our revenue. I think we're going to be back in that mode again for sure. We're again jettisoning those who were eliminating those non-recurring expenses and then getting more efficient in the way we manage our business going forward, especially with the new sales technologies that we're using, I could see expenses going down.

BGS,Q2,2014,"Okay. Lastly will just be, as you talk preliminarily about 2015 around inflation and pricing, is there a way to sort to start to help quantify a little bit, even though we know its preliminary, in terms of what type of overall sort of cost in goods increase you might have, and therefore with the type of pricing we are talking about, to try and hold your margins steady?","It's not at 1% of sales yet. Of course, that's developing thing. We are at mid-year 2014, so it's hard to project the full year 2015. Right now, we are looking at an increase that's below 1% of sales. What justifies taking price increases in that context, is it falls hard in certain product lines and not so much to the other product lines. So to the extent that fruit prices are a driver of this, and fruit is a very important part of the Polaner line for instance, you have to look hard at what kind of pricing you're going to do in that particular category.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue and I know this is a shortcut but was higher in the June quarter than we've seen in quite some time. I think it was the highest we've seen in the June quarter in several years. I know that you've gone through a lot of efficiencies. I think Peter, I think the expression you used was volatility in performance marketing. So just talk about how illustrative the June quarter was in terms of the optimization that you want out of your brand and performance marketing spend. You look at that number and you say, well that's the opportunity to those -- to that level of sales and marketing spend come in largely as you would be expected.","Peter, maybe I'll just give a little bit of context. I think one of the things to keep in mind, Mark, is that remember that our revenue is on a state basis, not the times our marketing spend is generating bookings that we're not going to get revenue for until another period if you will. And as I just talked about on the Vrbo 's side, we're continuing to see very long booking windows as a higher mix of our overall transactions. So, it is quite a diff -- and we're seeing other shifts and booking windows across different products as well. And so being able to compare quarter-over-quarter to historical again -- historical quarters, it is quite difficult, so I'd just caution you that simplified forum that admittedly that was simplified, we have to be a little careful to that because of those booking windows looking around and the difference between marketing spend booking and stay days.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

Or should we expect the growth in Europe to be in your emerging areas rather than on traditional Uniform?","But what excites us about Europe is things like Document Management but also facilities services. So, while we may not be as bullish on Uniform Rental in Europe, we are very bullish on the facility services, opportunities that exists, both in Europe and as well in the U.K. In fact, in some case, in some respects the facility services business may have a little bit more potential over in Europe than it necessarily does here in US and we are very happy about the opportunities we have in U.S. So, we think that the Document Management and potentially, facility services will be the big opportunities for us in the short run.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Just any commentary about your exposure there, if you can?","Yes. Ironically, those programs that have been announced over the last six months, we didn't have a lot in our forecast for those.

I think I feel pretty good we're going to hold gross margins, improve gross margins next year. Commodities will be what they're going to be, and that's part of the business and we deal with it.

Have you ever seen that number or do you look at that number?,"I'm not aware of that. It may well be that we have that data. I mean, really all I was suggesting is that as Medicaid programs try and reduce utilization, one might expect to see a reduction in both admission rates and length of stay and for the most part what we have seen over the last few years is really no decline in admissions. In fact pretty strong admissions on both the residential and acute side. But a contraction in length of stay, and again, my sort of conclusion that I draw from that is that it may be somewhat self-defeating strategy and that you are getting some patients out sooner.

But you're saying that's not... that's the case.

That's just the way the math works. The difference between the two segments, and I'll speak specifically to Engineered Systems, is that even though we had some significant price increases coming through during the first half of this year, especially in steel that we were able to pass through some of those charges with the coverage on existing customer contracts. But in a couple of instances, we also had pretty favorable hedging positions that were in position through June, through July and sometimes through August.

","Brian, as I said, we're now functioning under the Army contract, if you will. We are functioning as a sub to a prime, and I commented that we'll be at a reduced level. And that contract is in effect as we speak now, so we'll see that roll out over the next quarters.

","Yes. So the dose range in the DPN trial was slightly higher than this dose range but there is some overlap of this trial too in the higher dose. So that may be a factor. I think a larger factor is looking at DPN versus central pain in MS.

SANM,Q4,2012,"Okay. So, Jure, just to clarify if I understood your comments correctly, you’re explicitly looking for growth in fiscal 2013. I want to confirm that. And then, did you mean that you’re looking for the improvements year-over-year or are you also looking for improvements on your top and bottom line of your business sequentially through the year – or how do we think about that?","Yeah, well, based on the – if you look at our projects that we have with existing customers that have been a long time, we’re very fortunate that we’re involved in a lot of new technology products. So that customer base is pretty strong with most of them. Some of the new programs that we’ve won also have a fair amount potential and the new projects that we’re presently involved. So when you look at that, assuming all these things move in the right direction, I would expect us to deliver a better year than what we did in 2012. But at the same time, if the economy falls off a cliff, then it’s going to be a different world. But we do not expect that. We expect to see some improvements across most of our businesses, based on our opportunities that we have in front of us today; that’s really what I’m talking about.

AXGN,Q2,2018,"Okay. So, is it safe to say that there's a little bit of lingering impact from some other kind of the salesforce changes they implemented last quarter, lingering into this quarter that maybe understated where your true growth trajectory is and that's why you're calling out the direct reps being greater than 40%?","Actually -- I guess I don't see lingering issues. When you make a change in a bunch of sales territories, there is some disruption factor and we definitely saw that in January and February. We saw just that for a lot of the focus that you get when you have a lot of new people and new reporting structures in an organization. That's passed us. I don't see any event now. But what we do still have going on is that 50% of our direct sales teams that are new with us are going through a learning curve and the conversion curve. And if I put a little color on that, historically, when we brought reps -- a new rep into a territory, we brought them into it a territory, if you go back a few years and often we have very little base business, and we've talked about how they would expect to breakeven within a year. And what happened was that rep would come into that territory across the first couple of months of training, so there's not a lot of productivity in the first couple of months. Then they start to hit the ground running. They would have grown their revenue in those first few months and then historically, what we saw was they hit the valley of death where all their surgeons went into their wait period and they didn't have any business. And so in a later period, they would drop and then they would start to come up towards the end of the year. Today, we see an improvement in our productivity because they're handed a base of business already because we're splitting territories, or some base and a conversion from a distributor. And so they have a base. They are both maintaining that base and continuing to add incremental revenue that more than pays for their -- the cost of adding that rep in that first year. In addition we don't see them hitting that valley of death. So, we don't have a sort of low point where they're worried if they can make house payments and we're worried that their actual quarter-to-quarter growth. We are seeing that they continue to grow and it's particularly backend loaded.

So the total bad debt in 2018 was $27 million. The total bad debt in 2017 was $16 million. And it's hard to predict precisely where these accounts will end up during 2019. But, we're anticipating roughly the same level of activity in this category in 2019 is an 2018.",1.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Okay. Thank you. And I think you just, there’s a little bit to elaborate about the gross margin and ramping new projects might be pressing that, because you’re guiding to quite – you had a good performance this quarter and you’re guiding for the second quarter to remain relatively high. So, how should we think about that going forward?","Yes. And we don’t see really a significant drag from new program ramps in the future. I mean, we’re – somewhat always ramping new programs and we think the leverage we can get from the other business can offset the costs or the inefficiencies of new program ramps.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0

So, how should we think about that going forward?","Yes. well, I was going to say, as Todd said, I mean, we’re – from an operating margin standpoint; we’ve been really pleased with the last three quarters. So, hitting 5% or above would be our target. Expenses, we’re kind of monitoring, Anja, would be travel expenses and healthcare costs, those are things that could be potential headwinds for us, but trying to achieve that 5% or above would be our target.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, in the army and defense this quarter, you alluded to some issues with ramping new programs causing the shortfall there. Can you just elaborate on that and talk about how that’s going to keep in the coming quarters?","Sure. The space program, I mentioned, had some delays in the ramp, and as you can imagine, programs that are going into outer space, there’s a lot of stringent requirements and from a manufacturing process standpoint, we’re working with a customer on some strengthening of those requirements and it slowed down production. We believe, we’ve worked through those and have alignment with the customer on what the requirements are. And so I want to expect it to impact that going forward.",1.0,2.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
GGG,Q1,2015,"Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And in the process business, you know, the growth rate was -- volume price looked good, mid-single-digit, but it was a little bit of a slowdown from the big pickup you had in the fourth quarter. I wonder is - and what we're hearing from some other companies is capital projects pushing kind of generally in some markets because of currency or with the price of energy or whatever. I wonder if you just comment on what you're seeing from capital projects.","I've been doing a lot of traveling all over the place this year. And I would say that that's that's definitely a theme, especially outside of the U.S. here. You know, other than a few selected areas, it doesn't seem like it's real dramatic. But definitely there's an impact there and there's a tendency for people to be pulling back. Oil and gas is the obvious one. But you know, our exposure in oil and gas is still pretty small. We are exposed against a broad range of end markets and also a broad range of geographies. So it's a tough environment out there. Brazil is very challenged. China, for sure, I think is still trying to sop up a bunch of excess capacity in certain end markets they had put in place when things were going hot and heavy here for a few years. So it's a challenging environment, but I didn't get the sense in all my travels that this is going to be a repeat of 2009.",0.0,2.0,2,1.0,1.0,1.0
HAE,Q4,2014,"Okay. Thanks for that, Brian. And then just switching gears here. Several last calls and various conferences you have discussed your work in China and the progress you are making there and certainly what a large opportunity that is. Just wondering if we could get an update there?","Yes, China is part of the emerging market investment that we’ve made. We went from 50 employees in fiscal ’11 to 70 in fiscal ’12, to 125 in fiscal ’13. And there is no question those investments are paying off for us. We continue to see stabilization in growth in our platelet business as we win share in that market. We may not have the best technology, we are addressing that, we will give more visibility to that in May and beyond. But the beauty of that is it's the least expensive and the easiest used platelet technology out there, and hence we’re driving growth in the emerging markets. We’re seeing growth in cell salvage as you see a population emerging with the demand for healthcare and the lack of the supply of blood in China, so therefore we’re seeing growth in our cell salvage products. And we’re continuing to see growth in our TEG thromboelastograph product both in terms of our cardiovascular surgery but as well as interventional cardiology in that market. So growth across all three of those big product lines. We've implemented important measures around government relations, we're working with the local governments to understand their five-year plan and how we play a more involved role in that as they continue to evolve their healthcare system and how they support their population. So we continue to be bullish about that opportunity as we go forward.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GGG,Q1,2015,"Okay. Thanks for that. Looking at the contractor segment, you mentioned in the comments double-digit growth. It sounds like that's going to come from your efforts on the contractor side rather than the pro painter. Is that right?",No. In the first quarter both paint stores and home centers grew strong double digit. It was just that the home center grew faster. But our outlook for in the Americas for both of those segments is strong and we think that we'll do better in the regions in the last nine months than we did in the first nine months.,2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
EXPE,Q2,2021,"Okay. Thanks, Peter. And then the second one on Supply acquisition campaigns related to wellbore -- Navarre. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. We've been focused, I think, we said the last quarter. But we've -- our principal focus has been on compressor markets and we've seen good growth there and good additions. And when we can add inventory there, we see a very good return on that effort. We have not gone to sort of a broad global return to everywhere acquisition strategy because we just don't think it's a prudent use of resources and so many places are still closed down. But we are taking a much more targeted approach. And as the world opens up, I think you'll see us expand those targets. But in general, when we've been able to add inventory, again, focused on compressed areas that have been quite productive for us.

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Okay. Thanks, good morning and congrats to Shawn and Heather. Todd, I just wanted to start with some questions around the second half comments, where revenue is relatively consistent with the fiscal 2Q guide. just maybe, the biggest drivers of why we would see effectively flat sequential trends in Q3 and Q4, because we normally expect to build up each quarter or see it up sequentially on a seasonal basis. It sounds like towards the end of the quarter, medical and industrial saw a recent strength, you’ve got new customers coming on. So, what would be the offsets that I’m missing to make Q3 and Q4 effectively below normal seasonality?","Yes. I think that the issue Adam is that the visibility is just fairly limited right now. So it – I would say, it’s more of a situation is we’re just not sure. We just don’t know. And if you think back to a quarter ago, when we had our call, we expected Q2 to be flat to Q1. I mean, obviously, it’s not – it’s up substantially on the order of about $50 million. So, we saw a lot of upside demand come in, particularly around the healthcare and in the industrial sector. So, as we – as our customers brought up forecasts, they just brought them up in the near-term and not necessarily further out. So, I’d say there’s a lot of uncertainty to us as whether we’re going to see something similar as we move through the rest of the year or whether we won’t. but based off of the visibility we have right now, it looks more like flat at this time. But I think in some sense, we’re a little bit of a victim of our success from an execution standpoint, because there are customers feel comfortable that they can drop in demand and we’ll execute on it.",2.0,1.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
MPC,Q3,2017,Okay. Thanks.," And I think – Paul, I had mentioned even on the last call that heading into these drops, we'll try to provide some framework about how that will look pro forma for the transactions to sort of help guide your thinking around how best to model it.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,2.0
CTAS,Q1,2008,"Okay. Thanks. And I guess looking down at the cost line; you had stated that heightened legal expenses had an impact in the quarter.

TWI,Q4,2017,"Okay. Thanks. And then I just two more quick questions. You mentioned, Paul, I think that ag order books in Europe were weaker. Is there something fundamentally driving that or is that maybe driven by some [indiscernible] and some other rules in Europe, if you could clarify that specifically? And secondly, price cost, can you just help us understand what kind of inflation for steel and rubber you expect this year and what kind of price increases we should be looking for? Thank you.","As far as my comments on European ag, it’s weaker compared to the rest of the markets that are growing. It’s not in a declining situation that causes panic, it’s just – it’s generally speaking just not as strong as everywhere else and so it’s again not an area of highlighted concern where we’re looking back – that we’re looking to have to pull back costs and reduce production levels. But it’s just not an area of growth – it’s not the same level of growth as the rest of the business. As far as the questions on raw materials, I think our forecast for raw materials on the rubber side of the business, it looks like the supply is in pretty good condition. So the issues that existed in 2017 don’t appear to be percolating at this moment. And steel, obviously there’s just a lot of talk going on in the world these days about steel and specifically from the U.S. perspective. From our North American business, the way we have it structured we do believe at this time we have sufficient supply for steel and we have sufficient capability to pass through any increased costs to our customers in what I would call a timely efficient manner. So our North American wheel business is much different than our tire business. And so as we sit here today, we clearly are watching it closely both supply, costs, price in the market, but we don’t have forecasted headwinds for steel. And that’s generally true across the world on steel but steel is volatile. The announcements of potential tariffs and what may be going on with price competition clearly it’s something we just got to stay very close to. But at this moment, the way things are, the rising cost in steel is not a concern and it’s not even the same situation as what we faced last year with rubber. So at this point again, raw materials appear to be in a fairly stable, neutral environment and we don’t have any forecast for that. And by neutral, I just mean price to cost not obviously price of steel is going up. But for us, the price to cost ratio seems to be very stable.",2.0,1.0,1,0.0,2.0,1.0
SYKE,Q1,2015,"Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, has there been some fundamental changes undergoing in the financial services vertical since Drew Blanchard joined?",You mean internally insight? Or are you talking about from a market perspective?,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0
PM,Q1,2016,"Okay. That helps. And then the EU Tobacco Products Directive, which will be implemented in May, just curious to hear from you some of the key issues and concerns? And then what are you doing to mitigate those? And then also the costs associated with complying, were those above your expectations, Jacek?","Well, big part of this cost we have incurred in the Q3, very much Q4 actually of last year. I mean, perchance you remember we've had these – we make these decisions actually to preempt debt spending and some of these preparations calls – when it calls, to the product retooling machines, et cetera. It's a number of a cost buckets, which we'll have to cover, we decided already to take in 2015 – in the 2015. I think we were prepared. You know, each of the biggest challenges that obviously this directive does not hit due to the transition periods, which were put by the different member states, the transition periods are different in the different member states. So logistically it is quite an exercise. They might be, it doesn't have to happen, but it might be that there will be some distortions on a shipment level. I don't think it's going to obviously impact the consumption or retail uptake, but there might be some difference on a shipment level in the quarters going forward. But it's difficult, frankly speaking, to predict. There are a number of formats which will have to be replaced, one format has to cease its existence at retail level, has to be replaced by the same cigarette but in a different pack format, et cetera. So it's more of the logistic supply chain type of a stretch at this stage rather than anything else. I don't think structurally it's going to change our outlook in terms of our performance, both on the top and bottom line for the EU region.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,0.0,2.0
ACAT,Q1,2012,"Okay. That makes sense. And then on the related note, Parts, Garments and Accessories, your outlook for that business is maybe conservative, in my eyes, given the huge opportunity you have with Wildcat to sell PG&A. Can you help us unpack and sort of think through your guidance there?","Yeah, I think that there’s a good guy in there. When you look at our PG&A business, we said we’d be up 1% to 3%. The good guy being the Wildcat side of the equation. There’s no doubt that as people buy Wildcats, they will go ahead and accessorize those. And so we should see a very positive uptick on our accessories for Wildcats.
On the other side of the equitation, as we mentioned, the snow industry in retail should be up zero to 2%, but you can see our guidance in terms of shipments, down 4% to 6%. And so, with that, less accessories there. There are less people riding in the fourth quarter and we saw a drop-off in snowmobile parts. So if the dealers still have those parts, then we would’ve expected to see that a little bit soft next year as well. So you have some tradeoffs and some good guys in the Wildcat and then some negatives being impacted from the snow.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

It's mainly what I mentioned on the phone. The AccuSite product is going to be – is very important for us, and we're making significant traction developing that. And we think as we get into the next cycle of programs coming through, that should help us with our win rate. I feel the same way with our gap and flash product. The algorithm enhancement that we've done over the past year allowing us to measure translucent materials should help us there as well. As I mentioned, we did get our first order for an AccuSite multi-robot product in China, and these are all things that have been on our road map.

How would you prioritize paying down debt versus buying back stock, investing in the business, acquisitions, what's your general thinking on that?","Well, I mean, that's obviously a lot of components to that. But I would say, number 1 is to make sure our business is financially stable and that we have more than adequate liquidity to support our existing business, which we feel very comfortable with. We also have a number of new product ideas cooking, which we're very, very excited about. So we need to make sure we have the right capital allocation in place for that.

If you remember last year, we had a very good strong fourth quarter, and that's great, but it drove our manufacturing plants wild with maximum volumes through the plant and shipping challenges like we've never had before. So we asked our supply chain folks to get together with our commercial guys and to say can we figure out how to kind of smooth this a little bit so that we don't have such a huge number in the fourth quarter. Maybe some customers might actually want product in third quarter or could we at least move some of our manufacturing a little earlier so we don't run it all to the hilt over the holidays like we did in 2015.

Or what's the outlook there – just in terms of how that's shaping up?","Well, we are still comparing ourself to relatively late part of the – our – period of our performance in Asia – sorry, in Australia. I think Q4 2014, first quarter of 2015, however, we still were a little bit in a more – we're in a much more difficult situations in Australia. Australia is not a drag, neither nor in the quarter. No, I would think in our outlook for the full year, that sort of a drag would not even near the drag which we have had in the past periods. I mean the situation, I think the price increase at least, taking this at its face value as it is now, why the price announcement versus the excise increase, we'll have to see how it develops. But it seems that the dynamics in terms of the deep discount growth segment combined with these price increases from us and competitors might be a couple of steps in the right direction. So while I'm getting very cautiously more optimistic on Australia, but it's still, some time to go. But I think that the worst is definitely far behind us.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
PM,Q3,2011,Okay. That's helpful. And then just one final question on currency headwinds that you'll be facing as we head into 2012. What can you tell us about what you're expecting and maybe any of your hedging strategies? Can you give us an update?,"Okay. I mean, now, for this year, where we had forecast $0.25 currency favorability still around the second quarter earnings call, that has been reduced now, and we're now at prevailing rates. We expect $0.20 for the year. Well, that's pretty much the number that we have year-to-date. So therefore, I wouldn't talk about unfavorable currency in the fourth quarter, because actually, at prevailing rates, the fourth quarter of this year is going to be a currency-neutral quarter. We will see what the actual rates will be, but at prevailing rates, you could expect a currency-neutral quarter. Going into next year, who can forecast the currency rates of next year? I can't. I would only say we have so much focus these days, again, on the problems in Europe and around the euro. The focus will come back on the United States as well.

Is that an area mostly retail or are there other -- any other areas that you see that same competitive outlook in 2019 where you -- and other areas you might be exiting other than retail?," Yeah. I would say what we're faced with is a lot of its retail and what we would characterize is smaller order type business. We generally don't want to be in the small order type business, that's where some of our other competitors play, but we did have some historical business in those spaces. And so, we've been identifying those markets and segments where we do have the greatest value proposition offer both in terms of our service capabilities, order metrics and our value-added consultative sell, and as well as markets where there is better growth dynamics and profitability dynamics. And retail is certainly illustrative of that in the US specifically and as well as there's bad debt risk in that space as well. And so we've just as we've looked at the trajectory on this market, we're making choices of where we really want to compete in terms of where we can get paid for the value that we bring that matches to our service metrics, which are also more in line with the same kind of service metrics we offer in our Packaging business, Packaging and Print business.",1.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

And so those are wide format where you have huge, how do I describe, a sheet essentially of either resin-based products or paper-based products that printers have to support on big signs that you see outdoor signage, as well as some of these big things you see -- markings you see on the airport floors, for example, just to give you an idea of what it is, it's all in the Print space, we were supporting that business both from a paper-based and a non-paper-based and we're exiting the non-paper-based element of that.

PM,Q1,2016,Okay. That's helpful. And we've seen Gudang Garam take pretty aggressive pricing in late in the fourth quarter but then you're still seeing your share under some pressure in this quarter. And you've specifically mentioned some machine-made discounting. What's the pricing environment look like? Is it other competitors that are putting pressure on or were there price increases not maybe broad enough? Or can you just dissect a little bit some of your share moves and what you expect over the course of the rest of the year?,"Sure. I think everyone is – we don't see anything abnormal in the speed or frequency, if you like, of the pricing being taken in Indonesia. Obviously, with some positive adjustments due to the size of the – or relatively higher size of excise passed on – they'll pass on, which our industry was confronted this year. So I think as an industry, if I follow what the competition price moves are there, there's nothing really abnormal taking there. Obviously the prices are going a little bit higher due to this, as I mentioned, as a higher pass-on to be passed to consumers. Now the four extra stick price segment, of some four-stick discounting which has happened there, that segment of extra four sticks in the pipe which was sold at the price of the competitor's product with the four sticks less was therefore some time, I think, until the relatively late – okay, let's say maybe second half of the last year, the segment was at about 3% to 4% if I am not mistaken, size of the total market. So it is a segment that's not very sizable segment. We have our more sizable segments in the market. This accelerated I think due to some offerings or introductions from some competitors. We're not very active in that segment. I think our recent, the most recent reading of the size of the segment is somewhere in the range of 9%, maybe slightly above 9%. So it's growing. It accelerated the growth recently. I think in that environment when the consumer is confronted with the frequent price increases and maybe of a slightly higher nature than in the past, clearly some form of a price also discounting, I mean, it might be attractive to some consumers. So that puts obviously especially if you look into the quarterly shares, the monthly shares, they put a pressure on some of our propositions in the market.

I'm just curious if those -- obviously, it's a broad brand building activity, but obviously, Marlboro has been quite weak there. So is it targeting that brand? Is it -- explicitly that's -- it could help your performance in that market.","Yes. We are not happy, I've said that before, with the performance of Marlboro. I mean, it's just 2% share of market in a market that big and that important like Russia is, of course, disappointing for Marlboro, and we definitely think that Marlboro can do more. There is -- again, there is a marketing challenge. It can be that we have such little volumes for that brand in the markets. We will invest behind. We will build the brand equity, and we want to bring that brand also on a growth trajectory as in so many other markets in the world, in most markets in the world, actually.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0

Will the strong demand in Japan perhaps delay some of the, I think it's 13 markets that you're targeting by year-end?","Well, we targeted 20 markets to be present with iQOS on the city level, on the national level by the year-end.

CVU,Q3,2019,"Okay. That's hopefully some good news coming there. And then just my final question is, you're obviously continuing to do a great job on providing better visibility on the top-line. I really appreciate the three-year outlook. You've announced a lot of contract awards and the pipeline seems very healthy. But Doug, I guess, just the fundamental question is, how can you help frame the opportunity on the margins from the new programs?And to what extent, as you're layering in additional business on to the facility, do we maybe see better incremental margins? Or to what extent can the incremental margins in the next couple of years move up based upon, obviously, the higher volume you've outlined?
","So all of this work, keep in mind, we won, it hasn't started. Some of them have started on the floor, but things like A-10, F-16V, some others that we intend to win, they haven't started producing the hours that the - the manufacturing hours out of the shop floor, which they will in 2020. There's a significant benefit to our fixed cost absorption when these starts being out on the floor, and we're actually applying a lot of direct labor hours to them. So you'll start seeing that naturally occur within the next, say, 6 to 9 months.Don't forget though, a lot of our growth is with some of these newer programs, and we do carry these lower programs at, say, lower than production rate volume margins. So the expectation is that the top-line continues to grow. Will there - will we be able to achieve full run rate gross margins in 2020? I think that's kind of sporty.Certainly, by 2021, not only is the top-line approaching kind of not peaking, but higher again still than 2020. And then you'll see a full year's worth of benefit of all of that absorption and better manufacturing efficiencies. And once we get WMI on track and executing on their more than $20 million in backlog at higher margins, I think the combination is a good story for mid-2020 and on.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,1.0

Is the focus really on shredding or do you still have also a significant interest in pursuing the storage business?","As I have said before, shredding is by far our immediate focus and the one that we are the most excited about.

In theory, you should continue to generate some solid free cash over the next few quarters, what are the plans with the cash now?","The current plans, number one is to harvest it and be ultra conservative in this market. We don’t have any debt maturities in the near term, we hear about companies that do and our point would be very unfavorably treated as far as rate and availability. And secondly, we will continue to look for small fill-in acquisitions and those would be the two main, and then of course, we would always present to our Board the opportunity for continued stock buyback, and they would probably be in that order conservative, small acquisition opportunities and may be continue our stock buyback.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
GCI,Q3,2013,"Okay. The second question was, in terms of the newspaper business, now post the Belo acquisition, is there any thought behind the newspaper business as a standalone entity towards a less [ph] modest or something? And can you just give us your thoughts on why it should be part of the consolidated entity?","Sure. A couple of things, Kannan. First of all, I think for the foreseeable future, certainly into 2014, our #1 focus is on closing on and integrating Belo and achieving all of the synergies, if not more, that we shared with you when we announced the Belo transaction. So that's incredibly high on our list of things and our priorities right at the moment. I'd say secondly, as we've discussed, I think, several times is the fact that when we look at our publishing markets and our broadcasting markets, we really don't look at them as publishing or broadcasting solely. We look at them as local markets where we have incredibly strong brands, where we have been for a very long time, where we have rich, deep relationships with literally thousands of businesses, both large and small. And so when we look at things like what I'm talking about with G/O Digital and our digital marketing services business, what we are finding is as we've rolled that out across both publishing markets and broadcasting markets is that they are equally successful in generating additional digital revenues because businesses in those communities, in addition to wanting to have print or broadcast advertising, also understand the importance of reaching consumers on digital platforms and in ways that are more attractive on a digital basis. And that is true of the businesses we go at, whether they're in a -- whether we happen to have as our main brand in that market a title like The Des Moines Register or a title like WUSA Channel 9 here in D.C. And so we see the incredible opportunity we have to scale these additional businesses like G/O Digital across 111-plus markets locally in this country where we have common characteristics and common advantages. And we just see that as a unique huge opportunity that, frankly, no one else has. And so that's why we see this as -- we don't just look at them as publishing and broadcasting markets. We look at them as local markets where we have incredible advantages. And we have the ability to scale technology platforms and other things across 111-plus local markets in this country, which is pretty extraordinary for anyone.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
PTEC,Q1,2009,"Okay. Then I just want to talk about pricing of it, because to me and I could be way off, but if someone was looking at a low end Netbook for $300 or less, I mean are they going to be willing to pay $40 a year? What kind of studies have you done to come up with that pricing I guess I would look at?","Well, we know that the value of a Netbook is instant on and instantly connected and easily connected and therefore we believe we’re providing significant values. There’ve been studies done that show that consumers are willing to pay at least $100 a year to have those features and then in addition, it depends on the Netbook and the development of it, how it was developed, but we would also expect to have significant power savings. So we just feel like we’ve got some of the key features that people want in a Netbook when they are browsing. If they need Windows primarily, then that is a different use case but we believe we’ve got the right product and we’re going to be doing a lot of updating to the environment and increasing the capabilities, so our price is more a target price for a product you don’t yet see. We’re going to be adding things to it that enhance the ability and make it more of a stand alone product. We didn’t want to keep changing the price or forcing users to pay for updates or any of those kinds of things. So the price may seem a little high; we don’t think it is. We think that individual productivity will justify it, but as we start to complete the product over the next quarter and maybe even two quarters, you’ll start to see that the price is more reasonable than you originally thought.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

However, we are cautious about making any commitment to sort of granular forecasting elements and particularly to product level revenue guidance and so the simple truth is there is not yet enough data and therefore it doesn’t make sense for me to provide you any data.

The ASUS contract is one of the first ones that could generate leads in the millions and given the current economic climate, we’ve canceled our Super Bowl ad, so that will wreck our leads for it right there. So you have to spend money to get leads in significant numbers or you have to have a partner and our partner in this business is the OEMs. Like I said, given the economic climate, the amount of advertising and another kind of lead generation we’ll be doing, would be minimal. So we’ve got to get the OEMs in gear to generate millions of leads and that will generate interesting and significant numbers and we’re signing them up left and right.

Is that the way we should look at that?","So the impact of the currency has a big negative effect on our operating income because the majority of our cost certainly manufacturing we saw in North America revenue is reported international.

BLDR,Q3,2018,"Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then, on the manufactured products business, the 21% growth, I think I heard you say double-digit on volume. Is there any finer point you can put on that volume versus price there? Because it's just – obviously, given what you mentioned around the market growth next year, I think it would just be helpful to understand your growth relative to the market and so how we can think about that into 2019? Thank you.","So, I mean, we don't have any real market information that we feel comfortable banging up against. I mean, I think that when we talk about single-family, we have some high-level starts numbers, even that's tough given the changing size and profile of the homes that we sell into. We feel very good about our performance. We think we're at or above market. We think we're holding or gaining share as far as value add goes. Yeah, there's a good chunk of commodity inflation and pricing change in the number this year, but we're still solidly in the double digits for growth in the manufactured products, I think still in that double-digit range for consolidated value add, so clearly market share being taken in that space. I think it's consistent both with the investments we're making as well as the market adoption of that sort of labor-saving service that we provide in that space. So we feel like that is very healthy and I think consistent that we've seen pretty much all year and through last year.

SANM,Q4,2012,"Okay. Well, just to follow on that, can you perhaps elaborate, when you think about that business providing the relative strength, as you look into December and into 2013, to what degree is there perhaps, A, the project orientation where it’s the momentum with the customers that’s underway versus, B, better relative demand for some of your customer products in their general marketplace versus, C, explicitly the magnitude of new programs and perhaps why the environment has not disrupted those ramps? Thanks.","Yes. So let me kind of just give you a little bit more. If I look at our communication infrastructure product, overall we expect today a slight growth on that bucket. But if we look at the industrial side of the business, defense, the medical side, we expect more growth on that one. Also, our storage, what we call enterprise computing and storage, we expect that, based on a project that we have, to move in the right direction. On the multimedia, with that business being down for us – and actually there’s a two reasons there. Demand, and we also decided to end a relationship with one of our customers there. That was a relationship that was not profitable for us and we made a decision to exit that. We believe, overall, that business now is stabilized. I think we have a right customer. So quality of the customer, I would say for us is a lot stronger in 2012. We do have a fair amount of good opportunities in front of us, some new opportunities that we have a high confidence that we’ll benefit in 2013. So, Sean, we’ve been expanding again in a unique market. So the key there is to focus on areas where it will allowed us to deliver not just a growth, but more sustainable growth and go invest in these unique technologies that will allowed us to make a little bit higher margin. So if I can go back – and I know this is a long answer to your question – if I just look at our circuit boards, backplanes, overall, we expect that to do better in 2013 than what we’d accomplished in 2012. Same thing on mechanical, that we will deliver better numbers. I think defense and aerospace products, which are mission-critical products, I believe that will also move in the right direction in 2013. We got some new capabilities, we’ve been investing a fair amount. I think our storage product, our Sanmina ODM product, JDM product, I believe we are positioned to really win some good projects there and I think we got some new, unique technology that is competing in the high end of that game. We continue to invest in that business more. I think our Viking Technology modules, 2012 was a kind of a flat year for us there. We’ve been developing a lot of new technology in the solid-state drives. Qualification orders on those type of products are taking a little bit longer than maybe what we anticipated in 2012. We also expect that demand to move in a right direction in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, I think our Sanmina Global Services, we partnered with a couple of key players during 2012. We expanded the footprint of that – those capabilities, and I think we’re going to grow at least 20%, 30% a year in those areas. We improved our design and engineering service that works across all of these businesses. So, we did a lot of work in 2012 to position the company to be able to win new programs and execute better in any economy. So we prepare for both ways. But today, overall, I would expect that – I don’t know how much, but 2013 overall for us should be a little bit better year.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

When we look at Asia, which we talked about before, it's relatively – all-in, it's less than 5% of our revenues, still obviously very important, because a large part of that is golf, and the most headwind, if you will, we faced in Asia this year was a result of the Tsunami in Japan. Japan is a very large golf market, and certainly we have great relationships there especially with some of the larger multi-course accounts and they not surprisingly, they backed off purchases this year and we very much expect those to come back in 2012.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

LAKE,Q2,2016,Okay. What about Mexico? Is there any progress with – you noted previously that there are some big customers. Has there been any inroads do you feel at this point?," Not quite yet. The thing that flowed Mexico down was the drop in oil prices that we didn’t really – I asked a bit, most of the world didn’t anticipate that six to nine months about. But what we’re seeing is that, they’re beginning to make decisions, because Pemex is – the country of Mexico is not completely dependent on oil, although it is a big part of their economy. Pemex is the big part of that. And so those decisions have been sort of stalled. But I think as oil settles down in the 40s, people can sit down and say, this is the supply that we’re going to be used in these to the export. This is the amount of exploration we’re going to be doing and decisions will finally get made. They’re going to close down some production and keep other production going. One of the things that has happened with regard to the oil and gas slowdown is that the industry is found us to be an ideal opportunity to shutdown refineries into their long overdue maintenance that they haven’t done for years, which really helps that they buy a lot of garments when they do that.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

To what extent do you think the significant fall-offs in glass pricing that we’ve seen over the last 18, 24 months, how much do you think that has contributed to people just buying larger TVs because the price points have come down, primarily because glass pricing has come down. And we’re now, in 2013, in an era of moderate price declines as we get into 2014 and beyond, do you think that maybe we’ll see an end to the larger screen sizes? You see what I’m saying? Maybe the larger sizes will link to the lower prices? When you [unintelligible] lower prices, you [unintelligible] larger screen sizes a little later too?","I don’t think the glass price declines have been the primary reason why pricing at retail has gone down. Obviously it contributed and for panel makers, also the fact that the yen has helped them on their profitability has gone up. I just think that the price points and the quality of televisions are so incredible that it’s hard to imagine people buying a small television now. I got up early this morning and read a whole bunch of retail television ads for the past month, and I just remain stunned by how low the price points are. So I’m not expecting price points to go back up on large televisions next year, and I think we’ll begin to see sometime next year 2k/4k showing up.

But having said that, the shelf spaces had -- is being challenged hard and -- wherein some competitive categories like the bars, we are having to work hard to maintain our presence in supermarkets and places like that.

Any more color around how that’s helping, maybe in the second half of the year?","The screen size thing is becoming increasingly important. We really started seeing this large size impact start last year. We were uncertain whether it would continue to grow this year, but it definitely is, and seems to be accelerating. So you’re right about that. I think all of my statements on gross margin relate to our restated results from the prior year, and as I mentioned on our website we’ve done some updates on that, and many analysts asked us to do 2011 also. So we’re putting that on our website too.",1.0,2.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Since the end of February, what we have been doing is fine-tuning and refining our own internal processes. That's what we're working on today.

And right now, the mix is obviously saving the DBS-ODU given where the margin guidance is in Q1, after that is going to depend on really how fast MoCA ramps.

For us, process focus right now on areas like sanitary we think are very interesting. If you just step back a little farther than that, the more likely area for all of our future acquisitions is in the industrial and process segments.

PTEC,Q1,2009,One question for you on VPA contracts; has it become much more challenging to get your customers to sign to two year VPAs or are you seeing a mix shift towards one year quarterly and to what extent?,"No, it differs from customer to customer Nate. Last year there was a conscious strategy on our part, which by the way in retrospect I would say has turned out to be very smart, to extend out to two-year VPAs, which was done for several reasons. From the OEM prospective, it was an opportunity to increase their aggregate commitment to us, which in their view helped them to negotiate the best possible pricing. From our prospective, it provided us with insulation against the risk of loss of customer base during the transition to the Montevina platform and also to extend the length of the commitment at a fixed price and therefore minimize the ASP degradation that could occur if we were renegotiating ever year. Now, we don’t have particularly the Montevina issue now and customers are a little less willing to make macro commitments in an economic environment like this. So the negotiations this year, we consider to have been extremely successful as evidenced by the fact that we booked $17 million in new business in a quarter when our revenues were only $15 million. So that’s almost a two to one book-to-bill ratio and that is a great outcome by our sales force. It’s mostly one year VPAs, although some of them are things like 18 months; they might the life of a project, life of a product line kind of deals, but they vary.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
SYKE,Q1,2015,"One quick clarification, when you are talking about the 4% to 6% or 4% to 5%, as a gross level or a net level of growth for the industry?","Yes. Well on the market side, from the market growing, they would only be speaking about it in terms of growth. Because what they are talking about is saying, look if you have got 8 million people working 20% or 1.6 million outsource, they are looking at the total pie growing 4% to 5%. Now are it relates to us as a company, being able to hold on and grow our business at the same range, we are talking net, right. Because we do always have dynamics happening in our business. So normally, Bill, what that means for us as a company is, we need to be waning. Like when you hear us reference and we don't breakout the pipeline and everything, because in the end, it's about, are you growing or are you not? And for us, what happens is, on a gross basis, we really need to be generating almost 8% to 10% growth sells and then whatever is happening with the volume below is how our net comes out.

HLX,Q2,2010,"Owen I was wondering if you could give a little color on kind of your commitment to selling the E&P assets, and have you thought more about splitting the assets or maybe selling them more on a piecemeal basis given I guess that the deep-water kind of valuation assumptions have changed so dramatically over the last two months?","I am absolutely committed to the vesting the assets and yes to all of the options you just mentioned. I think given the uncertainty of this market, you have to be a realistic about what you can get accomplished at what value, for instance our capital spend, if you look at the six year, the next six years you’re looking and the total value of our portfolio, you’ve got something like a $3.5 billion capital requirements to generate 2.5 Tcf out and that’s over and above our 400 current PDP. That obviously is a big number for us and it’s not where we’d like to focus our capital. The options are sell it now and redeploy the value into the service side of the company, barring the ability to execute a 100% sale I think you do look at other options of brining in partners to provide the capital required and that preserves a lot of value going forward, but eventually we are absolutely committed to a divestment.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

So I don’t see this as an event that you would create a business around. I do think that it’s been demonstrated that our assets are very conducive to responding here especially if the hardware was preexisting I think you’re looking at containment within weeks.

By way of reminder, the IRENE cohort is a bio-bank essentially of over 2,900 patients that we had reported on in this poster that will be hopefully available electronically here in the next 10 days or so. These 2,900 plus patients all had early stage lung cancer, early nodules and were recruited from over 60 sites across 31 states in Puerto Rico. So very broad cohort focus very specifically on the physician’s dilemma of what to do with patients with nodules that are in this kind of immediate unclear diagnostic path? And what the poster that we presented and this will be – it’s co-opted by Dr. Nicole Tanner from the Medical University of South Carolina. And what we’ve identified is that there are significant differences in the practice patterns for the use of invasive procedures across the various sites by grouping, and this highlights within the cohort that we’ve captured a great tool on this bio-bank to be able to apply what we believe will be better diagnostic choices for physicians as they decide who to proceed into an invasive procedure versus those that they can put under surveillance and follow up.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

So I will just give you the global cash flow from Russia because, of course, with the crisis, we look at the figure to know what was the risk is around $1.5 billion in 2021 which honestly, at the size compared to a $30 billion is not -- yes, it's sizable but it's for 5%. So in the past 1, 1.5 figure, I remember Yamal LNG when it's stopped was around $1 billion per year as well. So we experienced this type of situation. But I hope not because I think for Europe, it's very important. By the way, I can tell you the consequence of any energy sanctions on Russia. I think globally, the company is winning because the impact on the oil prices and gas prices will be huge. So yes, I would say, our operations in Russia, our assets in Russia might be given us some headaches and to manage it. But having said that, we have been -- by the way, I said $1.5 billion, it's a big mistake. It's EUR 1.3 billion because I must not speak in dollars about Russia, just to give you the magnitude.

Generally speaking we’re seeing good improvements across the board. Now ag’s weaker in certain areas such as Europe, doing better in North America, holding its own in Brazil. For us I think that’s a – it’s divided pretty well between OEM and aftermarket, so I think both areas are functioning very well. It’s clearly not a commodity-driven process or improvement. It’s not a farmer income-driven improvement. It’s really just the industry fundamentals and Titan business fundamentals improving. And so I think the spread across the board and definitely improving size of the [ph] business. We’re seeing that move in good direction in just about every location. And I think that’s more driven by industry improvements and obviously coupled with some of the changes we had last couple of years. But you’re seeing more of an industry cyclical improvement there than you are necessarily in ag. I think ag is just fundamentals of the business and dealers getting their inventory right-sized. People managing input cost better. So for us, we’ve seen that kind of spread into our order books where generally across the board kind of like how we saw 2017, things are just fundamentally improving. And it’s not, Steve, happening in one big area where we could say this is the shining light and we’re going to follow that. I think we’re spread pretty evenly seeing things move, continue what they did in 2017 and continue to move in a positive direction for 2018 with order books. We got to continue to watch it closely. We got to continue to stay on top of it. And I think if we continue to do that, then 2018 will be a very good positive year for us.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

I'll take the question on the tablet. I think the tablet certainly are here to stay with the launch of the iPad earlier this year. There are several million iPad tablets in the market. I think data that's published from a number of sources would suggest that it certainly impacted not only the netbook market, but it's also impacted the laptop, and in some respects, even the smartphone market. So I think it's a choice that both consumers and small businesses will make in terms of their computing needs. So therefore, for us, having a presence in the tablet category, we think it is important. We've picked a couple of tablets that we plan to have as part of our offer in the fourth quarter, specifically for our small and medium business customers. We've also enhanced our offering of accessories both for Apple products, as well as other makers of not only tablets and smartphones. Short answer is tablets are here to stay.

And also, I still think you have something like $1 billion of face value bonds that are due in ’11 and ’12. Have you been buying any of those in or do you plan -- do you think that’s a good idea to buy them in or is all free cash flow simply going to go to reducing the bank debt?","John, on the pension side, as we’ve said, we will not have any mandatory cash contributions in 2009, we will not have any mandatory -- to the best of our knowledge, at this point, given where our pension fund stands -- in 2010. Obviously 2011 and 2012 depend a lot on what assumptions you make on returns, discount rates, employee population, et cetera, et cetera. Our pension plan I think on a preliminary basis is up about 20% or so for the first nine months of this year. A lot will depend on where the market and we end the year and where interest rates are, because that discount rate obviously can have a fairly significant impact on things as well. With respect to the bonds due in ’11 and in ’12, as you may recall we did extend the maturity of some of those ‘11s and ‘12s, I think about over $250 million of those maturities were extended in to 15s and 16s. Obviously we’ll continue to look at things on a very opportunistic basis and if we saw opportunities to do some things to further move maturities around and it made good economic sense for us, then we would do that.

RH,Q4,2020,"Quick one. One thing you haven't mentioned today is the art curation initiative with General Public. Just curious if you can talk about this a little bit, and how you see fine art as a potential opportunity for your business.","Yes. Well, this is an idea that Portia de Rossi came to us with and she's really the entrepreneur behind it. She figured out the technology and the 3D printing or - what does she call it? It’s called yes, xenograft. It's like a 3D printing. Like - you can look at a beautiful textured hand painted piece of art. And this - it replicates it perfectly. Like, you'd need a real art expert to be able to tell the difference. And her and her partner, Ellen, Ellen DeGeneres, they’re big art collectors. They've got great taste and style. Their homes are fantastic. And they just have incredible taste in art. And I think Portia is art history major. It was one of the things she studied. And she's just very, very smart entrepreneur. And she had a big idea about this. And she kind of came through some friends, made a connection to talk to me about, here's my idea and it’s what I'm doing. She just kind of got it started. And we loved the idea. We loved her taste and style. And we said look, we think we can be the platform that can amplify your idea. We can be your best partner. And that's what we've done. And she's working on ramping production and expanding the assortment. And the great thing about Portia like you just always know like what she's going to show you, you're going to want to buy because she's got such incredible taste. Except I'd say, she's probably listening to this conference call, there’s dog pacing but she came to me a few years ago. I know, I was joking around. So it's better actually, now I really like them and we're going to probably ask them. But I’m just joking around in case she ever hears this conference call. But no, I think it's an incredible opportunity for us. When you think about all the walls in a home and all the opportunity, there's more square footage on the walls than there is on the floor. And so yes, and it’s one of the reasons why initially years ago some of you may remember, we tried RH Contemporary Art and then we pulled back and we may try it again. The tough thing about we RH Contemporary Art was you only get to sell the item one time. So if you had it like a best seller, you had a great piece, you use that transfer of happiness happens one time. And then you're like, okay, we sold it and then now what do we do? Like I got a thousand people that want that piece of art and they sold it. So, the great thing about Portia's strategy, she said - what was her line? Great art for general public - I can't remember. She has this whole great view about it is - like her thing is this, imagine if the great books in the world there was only one that you couldn't publish another copy. Like that was her whole - I thought that was just brilliant. Right. Like imagine, like every book was just a collector's item and only one person could have that book. It makes no sense. Right? And so her idea and what - and the great thing about her, she's just tremendously persuasive. So she's great with all the artists. Because a lot of the artists are trapped in the old school of like I've made this and that's my piece. And now like this one person in the world owns that piece. It's kind of goofy. Like when you think about it. If he like, a fashion designer designed like one dress or one coat and no one else could enjoy that except for one person. So she's got this different view and the way she's framing it. And because she's a credible - her and Ellen are really credible art collectors and they've got incredible taste. And they've been advocates for the art community for a long time. That people trust her, and I think she's breaking through and she's getting better and better people on the platform. And she's convincing them like why only print one copy of your work. Like great novels there's not just one copy, right. And so people are starting to get that. And I think it could fundamentally change the art world permanently. So, that's the idea.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GLW,Q2,2013,"Quickly start on telecom. You mentioned an affiliate that you brought in house. Can you just give us a sense as to what it was, how large it was, and how much that impacted the numbers? And then you also mentioned in telecom that there were some delays in China and some large fiber deals. Do you have any color on what caused those delays? Was it the change in management that happened in a couple of Chinese carriers? And how far out did this get pushed? And I have some questions on LCD and Gorilla.","The small company was a previous joint venture that our Corning Cable Systems unit had. Its impact was about $5 million in Q2, and I think it will be almost $10 million in Q3 in terms of consolidated sales. It’s really relatively tiny. The telecom tenders, we were expecting tenders to happen earlier. I can’t tell you why they don’t. You probably heard me say in the past that we believe all of the telecom business in China is ultimately controlled by government policy. So whether it was the management changes or not, I can’t know for sure. But definitely tenders that we expected earlier have not happened yet. There is a tendering process right now. What we just don’t know is when it will be complete, and how much the volume will be. But definitely against our original expectations for China, this has been a slow down.",1.0,2.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0
SWN,Q3,2012,"Real quickly, as we look at kind of a multitude of new venture opportunities and getting more color on those in, I guess, the fourth quarter call, can you give us maybe some color with respect to spending on those plays between here and there and maybe with respect to '13? As you guys are gathering information, are you considering or pursuing bringing in a partner into any of the plays? Maybe -- probably the one you have the more information on would be the Brown Dense at this point.","As far as '13 goes, and really, as you look out into the future, I would just assume that not much more than about 10% to 12% of our capital budget will be going towards New Ventures on average. Now I think the individual year might be a little bit higher, so that's going to be a relatively constant number just to kind of what’s our total capital budget is in any given year. For the rest of this year, from a pure capital investment, while we're picking up some acreage in some areas, there's not a significant amount of drilling to do between now and the end of the year so most of our capital’s invested at this point in time. And then, your other comment about bringing in a partner. We'll look at each of our plays. And we’ve talked about this in the past, New Brunswick, we definitely ultimately will need a partner. It's just a matter of when to bring them in. Some of the other plays may end up needing to have partners for various reasons, whether it's to look at the risk standpoint or whether it's just total capital invested, and we'll just look at that as we go along.

But how do you – how are we accounting for the cash flow associated with the early terms in the Q2 guide? And is it worth mentioning those dollars?," So when we gave the revenue per day and the operating rig count and the cost per day, we excluded anything out about those early terms. The revenue we're going to get on the early terms between $1.5 million and $2 million, that's probably going to be offset by the stacking costs that we have that are coming in.We're going to have a large number of rigs come in that you've got to put new preservation on and things during the quarter and that's going to be a chunk of change. And there's some furlough opportunities that we're able to take for our employees during the quarter as a result of getting the CARES Act loan that those costs will probably offset the early term revenues during the quarter.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

There’s nothing that we’re seeing right now in terms of the level of inventory. I don’t have a lot of details, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, about where the inventory is. I did mention that in China there seems to be an excess of small sized televisions, 32s, but beyond that I don’t have a lot of detail.

As we look at pipelines and offshore platforms, as people look to find energy sources from other areas, the offshore plays a big role for us in the future.

The change from 4.3 million to 4.2 million tons, is really pretty modest, I guess, in terms of what we're seeing in the steel industry at the moment with all of the sort of iron ore and raw materials issues that they're having. Could you talk a little bit about the underlying blast furnace utilization numbers that are embedded into your full year production guidance?","So, interestingly, obviously, the blast furnaces have been affected by iron ore shortages, Lake Superior logistics, I've learned all sort of things about icebreaking barges. And let's face it, it's been a -- the winter has affected our customers in a pretty significant way. Interestingly, relative to the demand for our coke, there's been no desire on the part of our customers for us to dial back production. On the contrary, frankly, we wish we could've produced more from -- particularly from Indiana Harbor. So relative -- I can't really comment on overall blast furnace utilization as we go into 2014, my crystal ball is not that good. If you look at order books, and I do -- we do talk to our customers, their order books are strong, they would prefer to be running more. And I think if they get through the disruptions of the winter and get iron ore delivery more normalized, they want to run their blast furnaces at higher utilization rates and they're going to be pulling on our coke.

What we’re looking at it from our team’s perspective is that we’re comfortable with the outlook we put out there. We see the path on how to get there is really kind of how we talked about 2017 results is spread across all the business units and segments within our company. So the bridge is not simply just take A plus B and you get C. You’re getting revenue gains, you’re getting some margin improvements, you’re getting cost cuts, you’re reducing SG&A. And so – again, it’s really a broad based improvement. So what we’re looking at is again the overall forecast and the overall picture for 2018 supports the outlook that we put out there. As far as narrowing it down that’s something that as the year progresses, we could look at doing that.

But, that makes up all the ratable movement that we go through our refining system in the Speedway, the value in certain markets that we can glean out of Speedway. So all-in-all, as we look at Speedway again as borne out in this quarter, very, very strong segment for us, and we continue to see that going forward.

And what this can mean as -- in terms of the larger picture for GSE going forward?","Sure. Look, when we came into the business in 2015, we saw as part of the deep value this company can offer is packaging and licensing. It's IP in a contemporary fashion to industry to add value to the industry and create an ongoing annuity for GSE. And you look at where we are today, it's very significant SaaS-based revenue increase, 160% year-over-year, this is high value-added, very sticky, 80% to 90% gross margin. And that's really a direct result of the strategy and hard work of the team in working with customers. The growth potential is significant. While I won't put a specific dollar estimate on it, we certainly have the opportunity to go back into clients who have spent millions of dollars on our solutions and convert them into a recurring annuity, and we're working hard at that. The example of the Canadian client that we highlighted is just one example where we've achieved that conversion, but there are many others that we're working with to go through a similar conversion. The value prop is obvious. They don't want to have to support on-prem technology to hardware and software. They'd rather just support it Internet connectivity and a web browser much cheaper for the client, more effective and scalable for us.

And given the increased content you're delivering, is another price increase coming in the near term?","Yes, I think, John, with respect to pricing, the very foundation of what we did with our all-access content subscription model and now with what we're doing with these 4 pilots is to be totally focused on enhancing our content for readers and users. And we believe that when we provide additional value as we have with our all-access content model as we are doing with relaunches of our mobile sites and apps and a variety of other things and, for instance, in these 4 pilot markets where we are providing literally 70 or 80 additional pages of both national and local content that consumers are finding valuable and we're hearing from them the value they see in it, that we believe that will potentially give us the leverage -- some pricing leverage. But it's still unbelievably early. We're only a couple of weeks into it. I think we can probably speak more concretely about it when we get to the investor conference in early December. But we feel optimistic about our focus on content and bringing additional value to consumers. We've already proven that by doing that once. Consumers were willing to give us pricing leverage, and we believe that we can repeat that as long as we continue to provide that added content and value.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RRD,Q4,2012,"Shifting gears a little bit, if we look at the performance in Q4, it's definitely better than, I think, myself and the industry were expecting there in terms of the revenue and profitability. As the quarter progressed, what were the areas that kind of stood out for you in terms of the outperformers versus where you thought they might be.","And Charlie, just staying with financial because that's one of the points that we've harped on for the last couple of quarters, even in 2011, we've seen -- I think the numbers say that I have in front of me that from 2010 to 2012, the number of IPOs over this period averaged 136 per year. That compares to 2004 to 2007, where they averaged 205 per year. Now we're sitting here as we get through January, and January, obviously, as everybody has seen, was a pretty good month in the marketplace for that. IPOs were strong in January. M&A activity was led by monster-size deals. It's also a good sign. The low interest rate environment, private equities need to put their cash to work. And the fact that we're seeing strategics are looking to go ahead and have combinations that are going to give them cost savings, that all bodes well for our business. Couple that with what global translation services business and the 4 major verticals that they're playing in is also in a good position for '13, and the products that we've put together for the mutual fund and annuity providers, we think those are being well received in the business. So one of the things that's sort of been a headwind for us is this particular area, which we think, in 2013, has the capabilities to be a tailwind for us.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And our short-run fulfillment and our statement printing was also up in Q4 after being down in Q3. So that was up about 20 basis points. Magazine/catalog retail, up about 110. You look at logistics, which was better in Q4 than Q3. Office products continued growth in Q4 of about 5%, which is consistent with what they did in Q3. Premedia showed about 3% growth. And then on the international side, we did see a very strong performance in China, up about 13%, which was off of a Q3 which was up about 1% or so, and Latin America, which is a bit of the timing influence, but was much stronger in Q4 as well.

CTAS,Q1,2008,"Since your last call, I guess, it was about 18 seats and one could argue that's the macro outlook has moderated a bit and I guess in that context I am curious what is sort of embedded in the guidance to extent… reiterating the full fiscal year's revenue guidance. Have you in fact assumed that the economy soften a bit if so how much, is there something else in the business and self productivity or something else that’s ramping little bit better? We are on a better trajectory that might offset a slight macro softening since your last call.","Chris, I would say that while we are… our original plan that we put together, we talked about in July upon which guidance was based, assumed that there would be a modest, continuing growth in the economy, but that the real impact that would happen to Cintas is that we would to accelerating organic growth as we move throughout the year as the Project One Team became more productive with regard to its ability to sell, generate new business to cross selling. But we still believe that is the case, while the overall economic environment, you say has moderated some. It really hasn’t changed our expect… from what our expectations were. It's certainly not a very rapid growth business, but we didn’t expect our rapid growth economy, but we didn’t expect that any way. So, my only concern is assuming there is not a recession, where we start to see a bunch of people being loosing their job and there is certainly no indication of that yet.

And if so, was it transitory and what kind of got it moving in the right direction?","Andrew, there is a lot of unique circumstances going on here right now. I think it's unusual, it's unusual, and I think the promotional phenomenon if you will, I think is partly because, you already promote the brands that are sensitive to promotion. So the question, well how much additional promotion are you going to move the needle -- how much you're going to move the needle by doing the additional promotion on a brand, that you already are putting a decent amount of money against. P&M for instance, is a highly promotional category, I think upwards of 80% of the volume at certain times of the year sells on promotion. How much are you going to move the needle by doing even more promotion? So I think there is that factor, and then putting promotional money against brands that aren't promotionally sensitive, you're obviously going to be very challenged to suddenly get a consumer response when you do the promotion. So I don't know that it’s a really good weapon in a lot of cases.",2.0,0.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0

I think that in general, demand has stabilized. In general, I would say we feel better, and I'd say the travel industry feels better than what we see in the overall economic numbers. We are seeing corporate travel coming back pretty nicely, both for us on a same-store basis and as far as signing up new clients. And we are seeing some tightness in occupancy and ADR strength in some of the metropolitan markets where you see a lot of business travel, in the New Yorks of the world, in Hong Kong, in Singapore, in London, et cetera. So I would say all of the signs that we see are pointing upward. Now I'll note that they are against very easy comps. And I think the comps are going to get harder as the year goes on. So I wouldn't declare all systems go yet, but I think the trends are good. And I think to the extent that we have a balanced business, a good, strong domestic business, a strong international business, a strong leisure business, a corporate business that's growing very, very quickly and on top of that, a terrific, terrific media business, I think we'll benefit from all those listings, so to speak.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And as we've gone into the fall season, really focusing on going after the Fine Fragrance business with the first Victoria launch, if you haven't seen it you should, and really has been very pleased with the response that we have gotten.

It stimulates demand. But still, it's not going 100% for us so far, and we kind of like having a mixed mode to tell you the truth, but it's really we focus on what the customer wants.

TER,Q2,2014,"So I guess, first question is on the turns business. So were you surprised at the magnitude of turns in the quarter? And could you have even done more?","Yes. Surprised is a term of art because we always, in our manufacturing model, put in enough upside capacity to deal with some amount of surprise or pull-ins. And in this case, the customers were pulling hard to get a little bit ahead of some of the ramp of silicon for some product launches coming soon. And on the Semiconductor Test side, we actually exhausted not all but quite a significant portion of our upside. So it would have been hard for us to do much more in SemiTest than we did. On some of the other segments, we did still have some dry powder. We could have done more. We didn't need to. But that's a position we're in pretty much every quarter. When we're in a peak quarter like we are in the second quarter and third quarter months, we can have, depending -- if the mix hits right, anywhere from $50 million to $100 million of upside. And in a trough month or trough quarter, we might have $150 million of upside. But that's how we've been running the business now for 4 years, and it helped us really be responsive.

TWI,Q4,2017,"So I wanted to talk about the SG&A. Just first off, wanted to – in terms of the fourth quarter, so your SG&A fell about 2% I think, revenue up 22%. Could you explain to me how that’s really possible with such strong revenue growth? Essentially I’m just trying to make sure that we’re not eliminating certain costs that will sort of hinder future growth.","Yes, this is Jim. Again, as I mentioned in my notes, we set out a number of initiatives at the beginning of last year, one of them was what I called profit leaks just taking a close look at doing the basics, looking at our SG&A expenses. And there was quite a few findings at the corporate level. For example, naturally when we solved the remediated material weakness, our audit fees came down and cost associated with that. That’s just an example. We’ve taken a close look at our legal spend. So basically it’s taking a hard look at, as I said, every fixed and variable cost. Now to address your question, are we hurting the business? No, I don’t believe that. We’re increasing our productivity, as Paul said. We’re taking a hard look at making sure that how we invest our money in SG&A.

VNRX,Q1,2021,"So I was wondering if you could talk about how the first nematocysts products can be launched and what the go-to-market strategy is. Specifically was wondering what the most likely use for the first assays are going to be I get? I understand that it is probably from monitoring, but just like which disease I was kind of thinking. And when you say launching the product on multiple platforms, do you mean allies or beads when you say that or do you mean like, the actual amino assays analyzer like the ? And then on the go-to-market plan, is there going to be like a beta launch in Europe and then like a broader launch later? Or how should we think about that? Thank you.","Thank you, Kyle, and thanks for your questions. I will answer them more than make sure if I forget one of them, please return. So which disease so a couple of quarters ago, we thought perhaps under NETosis/influenza, sorry, for COVID in an influenza might be the way to go. But I think given the waxing and waning of NETosis from COVID, I think perhaps sepsis might be the one which is easiest to get the traction in. Certainly the easiest way to get large numbers in a trial because obviously, as I’m sure everyone’s aware, it is even during the pandemic, there is the biggest killer in hospitals. So it is obviously a very, very big problem and therefore much smoother ride to get the numbers needed for trial. When we say multiple platforms that is a good question. So we launched the vet on plates, and initially where we are now. As you can hear, we have been working a lot on getting it on the machines. We are using IDSs as machine but we have also explored different machines, we can use it on the larger auto analyzer machines. And we are also producing the beads at large scale now so we can absolutely launch things depending on what machines are available but on bead based machines, and adapting to a new machine seems to have taken just a few months ago. There is obviously new regulatory work but the actual adaptation is quite easy. But we have also mentioned we have also working a lot on a point of care both lateral flow small machine. We have actually, Dr. Eccleston, who is in his new role, as technology has been looking at a lot of different options for just simple yes, no lateral flows, quantitative point of care, and also the small machines. I won’t mention the companies but because of confidentiality, but we are talking to quite a few. And we actually have our essays out to a quite a few different companies. So for small point of care machines, as well as lateral flow. So it is what we aim to do with everything. I think, as I think it is clear, what we believe is this is going to be potentially huge in a very wide range of areas. So rather than saying to a customer, or a government or someone, it has to be on beads, or this machine, or this point of care, we aim to offer a full menu. So I guess they say, courses for courses, sometimes plates are easier, particularly for research. The machines are very easy, if you want a high throughput. The RDS machine, for example, can do 500 samples a day on a quite a small machine. We are hoping in the future to license to groups like the big auto analyze the companies, there is about half a dozen of them at Roche, Siemens and then developed a point of care. And that is quite developed to the point of care as well. So the go to market strategy. That is a very good question. And I think, as you have probably created, from what I said, we have been very, very happy with the results. In the diagnostic power, increasing diagnostic power, patient selection, also monitoring disease progression. Also, we are trying to show some prognostic value as well, from the assays, which I think we may get to. So the go-to-market, I guess like every way you are looking at different regions. The EU, to get a CE mark could actually be reasonably quick, because the platform we have CE mark very similar assays before, and then we aim to see mark them on beads quite quickly. So once we have the chosen intensive use, and it could be one of a few of those things. And the samples run, it is just a couple of months process to finish off the CE mark. So what is caused us some time has been finding the right population to get a CE mark trial in. But if, as you mentioned, at which indication, sepsis can be reasonably quick, because there are many, it is everywhere, as you know. And that is year round, summer, winter, and in every hospital in the world. So I hope that answers all your questions, how does that matter? And the U.S., there is some talk of trying to get emergency use, which of course we try for the COVID. But I don’t know, I think it is certainly less than 50/50, we would get that so it would be normal. The process we look to go through in a range of areas is to go to a CRO collect for a 510 (k) and then go for it go through that path which Dr. Terrell has done quite a bit of work from in a range of areas. So the cost of that is a few million dollars typically. We tend to look at two or $3 million and it usually takes up 12-months, 18-months for collection, plus all the regulatory timing from whenever we start the process, which we are working on now, but we don’t have a timeline from when we expect to start. I guess that will be driven from the data we have got coming up in the next few months. We have our assays in the hands of a bunch, like five or six different groups now who were using them in their own trials to show the efficacy as proof of concept. So that is all coming together really well. Does that answer your question?",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
HOME,Q4,2017,"So Lee first thing, if you think about the category reinventions for this year rather the categories and the chronology maybe just remind us. I know, I think this is year one of Wall Art and maybe the final year of patio. But how do those sequence and do you think the comp benefit from category reinventions how does that compare this year to last year and year before?"," I would say first and foremost our reinventions continue to be part of the engine that drives our business. We’ve been doing this now for five years basically in total across all categories the reinvention performance has been consistent each year. So it continues to be a positive driver of same-store sales for us.
We’re pleased at FY 2018 reinventions, we had better patio furniture decorative accents, pillows and cushions and better beddings. We’re really pleased with those. FY 2019 the strategy is the same, patio which it’s in third-year reinvention this year we lean into the cushion side of the business. So we’ve got premium cushions in larger sizes, a lot more new styles and patterns, fast fashion prints and new color palette. We’re pleased with that especially this spring.
In the back half you’ll see a Wall Art reinvention that’s going to be mostly it will be assortment and operationally driven and easier way to shop for our customers, a cleaner way a layout for the store as well as seasonal with the back half reinvention.

So, you can get there pretty easily. It's not a lot of moves. And some of it will depend to just how much - where is the revenues really go here. We don't need a lot of revenues to kind of get to where we're pointing you. If for some reason these revenue trends continue - like, I mean it's really interesting. I've never - this is - I've never seen anything like this. I mean, I've been through the Great Recession and I've been through multiple recessions in my career. I've been in the home category now like how many years, 34 years. Just like Jack reminded me the other day it was my 20th year anniversary here, not to get to everybody that wished me happy anniversary, but I don't even know that. He goes, Oh, God I'm sorry. And I missed your anniversary. He didn't even know it's my anniversary. So, yes, I've been here 20 years, at Williams-Sonoma, 14 years. I've been 34 years in the home business. And I've seen a lot of cycles during that time. And I've never seen anything quite like this. I tend to - when there's really good news like this, I tend to be the pessimist in the company. I tend to be the one with just - whatever demand you think we're getting right now, it's not because of us. It's not going to stay. Don't architect the business for this. This is going to go away. And it hasn't gone away yet. And I've talked to some pretty smart people that have given me different insights into - look, Gary, what - like, here's one that I think is interesting for everyone to think about. And this is really smart. And it comes out of an - from analysis from a really credible deep thinking smart person that the move of America that you're seeing today, the pandemic shift of out of cities into suburbs or into second home markets, which - by the way, the suburbs thing is a great thing for us because 80% of our business is in the suburbs. And so the move to the suburbs is not just a move to the suburbs. It's a square footage expansion by - they believe it's two times or more square footage expansion for the consumer. And I hadn't thought about that before. And that was a really interesting point. And their map said, look, Gary, your customers that are moving from the cities maybe in a 3,000-square-foot apartment are moving to a 6,000-square-foot to 10,000-square-foot house in the suburbs. And they didn't have outdoor furniture in their apartment in the city. And now they all have outdoor furniture because they have big yards and lawns and pools and so on and so forth. And so I just like that done to me, right? I hadn't really thought about it like that. I didn't think of the square footage expansion of the consumer. And the other thing they said was that the issue with getting a contractor right now is a huge issue that you could go out and buy a house. But if you have to remodel it or do anything to it, you have to wait six months to get a contractor. So they believe six months or longer and some are - there's this real lag. And so this person believes that and they said this to me and I was like, I didn't even know how to respond. Like, they believe that our business was going to accelerate because of the lag, because of this massive shift, right, that the longer the pandemic went, the more people started moving permanently. I'm not talking about the people that kind of flew back to their place in the Hamptons. That's very different, right? Like think about New York. Everybody went to the Hamptons, they could. Anybody that had a house was at their Hamptons house, right? They relocated there for the year. Anybody that could rent a house in the Hamptons, rent, whatever, you could buy one like bought one. So, but a lot of them are coming back and let it in. And at first everybody was like a temporal thing. And then all of a sudden then there's this shift of a different perception of how people wanted to live and it could be a more permanent kind of thing. So I think this moving thing could be a much longer tale and a much bigger move. And then you say to yourself, well how long does it last? It all depends on how permanent the move is, right? Like, so if you think about our business and I'll give you some numbers that I've never really talked about before. But our business prior to the pandemic was 80% suburbs,10% second home markets and 10% urban market. So when I think urban market, I'm talking about the city, right? Like not Beverly Hills is not the city in Los Angeles, right. The city is the vertical part of Los Angeles, it's called Los Angeles City. So we have some vertical markets like Manhattan or Chicago, right? That really vertical that have a lot of high end homes and we have relatively big volume. But almost everywhere, our business is much more suburban driven and that makes sense. The homes are bigger, got backyards, you've got kids. You've got like more bedrooms, more spaces, more family rooms, etc, etc. And then the pandemic hit and it shifted things. And you have this explosion of second home markets. And all that happened to our numbers really is the second home markets went from 10% of our business to 20%. Now the group spent exponentially faster and this is the percentage shipped, right? So you're - and 12% - 10% to 12%, yes, 10% to 12%. And then and then suburbs basically stayed the same and cities just went down by two points to 8%. But if you think about our model of being 92% of our business and this is not where the demand generate, this is a shift to addresses. This is where the product was going, right? So if you think about 92% of our business is architected perfectly for whatever long-term change this pandemic has and there's another study about the kind of the big shifts in kind of moves when - I try to remember the data, sort of person was talking me about it. I mean how every so many years, there's a shift here and there's a shift, people are moving in here and there's a big move into the suburb of the 50s and 60s and 70s and that kind of move back into the cities over the last 10 to 15 years, right? ReGentrification and all this kind of redo of cities. But the shift that might be happening, might really stick. That's the logic that certain people here are kind of sharing with me and they think this is not temporal. They think there's going to be a lot less people that go rushing back to the city and they think that the rush back to the city is going to be at a much younger consumer going back. And that the consumers that are 40, 50, 60 years old that moved out of the cities are going to stay out of the cities. They don't think they're coming back. And then that becomes - when I think about it that becomes really good for a business long-term because that that also means even the moves within the place like not everybody. If you think about it you moved out to the suburbs, you scramble and got a second home during this pandemic rush there's kind of it's almost like a movie, right? Like everybody's got to leave the cities and all the cars are backed up and the kids get out and it's - the odds of you getting the house you really wanted in that moment is really low, right? And I got to believe there's a lot of people renting homes, I know we're doing a lot of quick design installs, people like need the furniture in two weeks, right? And luckily and one of the advantage, here's another advantage this is like kind of a little side point to this but I think it's worth saying and sharing with everybody as we all try to figure out where things are going and what's happening here is. Like I thought about this and I thought. Why is our demand really accelerating right now? What is happening? And I think that there is just back up, this pent up demand just like people couldn't get contractors. People are out now and finally come. But for all the people, that are moving out and they need new furniture and they needed in 30 days. So they need it in three weeks or two weeks, I think we're benefiting now because we actually stocked furniture. We were one of the few places that actually stocks the product and you can get it quickly. Not everything. We have a big special order business and we're in backwater now. But this is where times like this, is where I think our model is advantaged versus a Wayfair in Paragould, anybody else online. What I call our marketplace model where they did only the inventory, right? But that's - one of the beauties of a model like that, it's a low capital model and you should setup for high returns if you can get the earnings model to work right. But no one ever really thought about what's the inherent weakness of that model. If you go on Wayfair and like - and we mostly look at what they're doing on Paragould. We look at anybody who might be competing with us. And the amount of out of stocks and what you can buy there is unbelievable. Because they're - then - their weaknesses, you've got a lot of these small and capitalized businesses trying to just sell shit on a platform like that - in a marketplace. They'll take anybody by the way. It's not a big approval process. You want to go sell some on Wayfair. So, actually you don't get to that many vendors that quickly if you have really high standards of who's selling on your platform. Yes. You can't possibly talk to that many people. That means a lot of low level people are approving a lot of new vendors. But I look on there and I know some of the people and we know who the factories are all around the world. And again, those people don't have any money. They can't afford to have the inventory, right? So I think in sustained things like this, we actually, I'd never thought of it, but we actually have the inventory. Like we actually, if you needed your house furnished next week we could pull it off if you live in a major market. So that's a big, big opportunity for us. But I want to go just go to that point about the 25% operating margin and what are the opportunities beyond 2021. Just scale this thing, right? Like we have a lot of a lot of strategies and initiatives that we think are margin-enhancing strategies initiatives. I think well, RH in your home is initially an investment. I think it's going to have a great return on investment. And we just have a lot like that. We keep fine tuning our model on our new galleries. And I think they're going to be more productive and less productive. Our restaurant business is going to be massively better. Our waterworks business, we've got the - versus three years ago, I think we've got the EBITDA probably 12, 14 points better, 15 points better, something like that. So, and then you just scale this thing. Just - think about this like, we're $2.8 billion company. That could be so much bigger. And we've built a really smart and simple platform here that you can scale. And so the leverage as we scale, you think about like other - somebody brought up Sonoma to me last week as they obviously had great results and fantastic outcome. And I think they're doing a tremendous job. And - but they’re already at $6.5 billion or something. What is it, $6.5 billion, $7 billion? So, yes, $6.5 billion, right? Like, we’re not even half the size of Williams-Sonoma. And we have the operating margins that we have today, right? So just do scale now, pick up 20 basis points in, like, eight different places in the company. You get - it’s a real leverage, right? And so that's why we think we have a line of sight to 25% operating margin plus today, plus. And so far every margin target we've given you we've got there much faster, much sooner than later, right? So, yes - so we wouldn't be so confident and clear and tell you - like, if we couldn't see it and we couldn't draw the straight line to the numbers. So we just keep learning here. And we're kind of always unsatisfied, always on the move. Like, we rarely celebrate. Like, it's for moments - it's not that we don't at all. We get super excited. But constant students we learn. And so what - if you keep learning, keep seeing more, and if you can see more then you're just never satisfied with where you are. So - and that's kind of our culture, right? I think this team - and we've integrated, like, 10 new senior leaders into our leadership team. We've got - some people I can't talk about yet because we weren’t kind of public with the idea. But we've got leaders of international supply chain. We've got lots of new talent sitting around the room. And that also allows us to do more. We've made a lot of human capital investments here. So, anyway, long rambling answer. Sorry about that. But just some - I thought some of that stuff could be helpful. That was helpful to me to think about how to think through this pandemic just like the moves and the move to the suburbs and how that might affect us and the square footage growth. I think the square footage growth is really an issue because you could be selling two to three times more furniture just because - to the same consumer. And it's interesting because our tickets going way higher, average orders are going way up. Yes, so it's kind of actually playing out like that.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

BLDR,Q2,2019,"So back to value add. Give us an idea where you see that go and say next year, next three years, next five years. I'm going back to the comment you made when asked about gross margin, you said normalizing above 26% at the current mix. I assume the goal is not to keep the current mix. So what I'm trying to get at is where do you see the mix going overtime? And where do you see the margin going overtime as a result of that mix shift?","Yes, it does move and I think we can kind of talk about the fact that since the merger, when we were about 36% value add, were' up over 40% value add. So there's clearly a trajectory there that the footprint and the investment in capacity has enabled us to track with broader industry transition towards that type of off-site manufacturing. So we feel good about it, pretty tough to predict in any given period, what the growth rate is going to be, and what the impact on mixes. And candidly, it's almost impossible if you want me to forecast commodities because the problem with that 26% and with the value-add percentage is that is dependent on the value of commodities, because it will change our relative mix just from $1 perspective. So it's a little tough to extrapolate. I mean, I would say, if you're talking a 0.25 to a 0.5 point of growth on an ongoing basis, assuming that things continue to trajectory, that's probably a reasonable basis, unfortunately, as soon as a stable commodity price, which I wouldn't be foolish enough to promise you.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

I think the other side of it is, is that POS sales at our customers are strong, and I think as we see a little bit of an increase in the economy and some of the workforce that's been unemployed starts to get jobs and need their vehicles and can't defer maintenance anymore, you see a pickup in repairs.

Let's see. Well, I think the industrial business – it's got some strong spots and some not-so-strong spots.

That's an earlier process than we've ever had before in terms of reservations toward new consoles. We've never had that much lead time. We were, as Paul and Tony said, aggressive about our trade programs. So what you start to see is the inflow of inventory with the trade offers that we were making, and then over the course of time through the third quarter, you start to see that inventory turn around and flow out in terms of sales. That impacts the margin rate. So the margin rate, in of itself, would not change based upon what flows in and is in our inventory. It's when it starts to sell through that you see that. And so it's not, again, just something that we started this quarter or wasn't started in reaction to what we were seeing in terms of trends. We went out of the gates, very aggressive in terms of driving reservations on the consoles. The trade-in program was a big part of that process, and we continued through the last 5 months to be aggressive on driving reservations because we want that allocation from the publisher -- or the console makers.",2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0

PM,Q1,2016,"So one, just going back to Japan, Jacek. I mean, the market share trend there continues to be soft, and just wanted to get a little bit more color, just in terms of your effort to improve cigarette market share in that market. And are you increasingly looking at that market with iQOS now more holistically and trying to kind of look at the total market share including iQOS? And in markets like Tokyo where your iQOS market share is pretty strong, is that where you also see a bit more impact on the combustible market share?","Well, I mean we try to look at this stage of the – I guess the two product propositions separately. There are challenges which we are facing on our combustible business and we're trying to get the right portfolio of innovations into the market to address that problem. I think the launch of the Parliament Crystal Blast towards the end of first quarter, which is an operating initiative which we're bringing to address the pressure which we'll have in this new taste menthol category, the capsule product, et cetera. So by no means, we are refocusing our attention from a combustible to iQOS. Now, having said so, the story of iQOS is getting more and more exciting every time we look at the results from Japan. Now, I have to admit one thing; this is not that we are trying to mask somehow our performance in the conventional business. However, 0.8%, if I take the offtake shares from the places where iQOS is available today in Japan and I recalculate this to have an equivalent in-market sales market share to compare it to what we refer to on the conventional business, 0.8% in a quarter, knowing that there was a cannibalizations from my own portfolio and very much skewed towards Marlboro, I would guess if we just assume that half of that or close to half of that was for the cannibalization, clearly, iQOS already has an impact also on my conventional share performance. If I would just, as I said earlier, apply that or to use that number to explain the market share performance of Marlboro, about half of the Marlboro decline, I could – I should actually attribute to the iQOS cannibalization. It's a good cannibalization. However, this is what we might observe for some time.

Certainly, we have, besides our current balance sheet, and the fact that we haven't borrowed in our borrowing line, we have some other assets that we could monetize in some way and midstream some of those other assets. And then you certainly have whatever you have a discovery on, whatever you're doing something on, you can sell part of it or bring a partner in part of that in. It just depends on how big, how fast you're ramping up and what generally you found. So I can't really say what we do with midstream or what would be first.

I can tell you, we did spend a little more than we had earlier budgeted. Some of the new projects that we're working on do have some significant on-site expenses, including programming software in different languages and some significant industrial designs and a few other things. So it's not just our own people cost. And those do come and go as you would say. So I think [indiscernible] to be a little more thought and maybe address it more next quarter, but I would not necessarily just take this quarter and multiply by four. But we're actually reviewing that now as well as some of the – R&D is a little more confusing, because we have a lot of R&D going on in some of the acquired businesses like in the U.K. and we have some things that we're going to be doing in Italy.

RH,Q4,2020,"So that’s a great segue to my second question. I did want to go back to the comment that you saw 750 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2020 on 8% of revenue growth. So for this year you’re guiding to 100 basis points to 200 basis points on top-line growth of 15% to 20%. So are you being conservative because there should be - I would think there should be natural leverage from all the results of sales going through? So is that just for being conservative, or are there any onetime expenses that are pressing this year and should go away next year and the years to come to help us sort of understand why operating margin expansion would only be 100 basis points to 200 basis points on 15 to 200 - 15% to 20% sales growth?","Yes. I would just kind of look at the history here and ask yourself, are we generally conservative, are we generally aggressive on our projections, right? So you can draw that conclusion, right? And with the comments I made earlier, I mean we wouldn't say a minimum of 15% to 20% growth and 100 basis points to 200 basis points unless - like I said, obviously, history would tell you here is look at the last - I don't know X number of years that we're relatively conservative in how we guide. And we generally outperformed our expectations, especially the ones we give at the beginning of the year. The question here is will there be a big economic change? Like, nobody knows that.

So largely the two issues that we see on the order side is timing within APPT both in India and in North America. The aftermarket is strong globally, sequential growth. Mold-Masters, all regions, all product lines in order, and then I would say in fluids where we have, let's say, as Bruce mentioned, we had a bit of hold back because of material shortage, but on the flip side, I would say, other regions performing well, Europe bit behind in fluids. So largely on the order side it's timing in APPT in North America and India. India is really a result of the elections, but we have a super pipeline both in equipment and also in retrofit.

The enrollment is above expectations. What we're seeing as we see strength in younger and higher income shoppers.

The basket has multiple times higher than what an average customer is which just give us excitement about the possibilities over time. The other program that we have that we're also very excited about is our Insider Perks program. We're at 1.4 million members. We ended the fiscal year at 1 million in only five months that average basket is also higher. So what we're focused on as we talked about driving all the organic metrics.
We're focused on taking those members launching our CRM program which will be collecting data on, driving frequency and then you start mixing with higher baskets with those programs and then you start to see overall business continuing to grow.

","No, certainly not a shift in focus.

But specifically, I just wanted to see if we could get a little bit of color in terms specifically the gross margin drivers, the SG&A leverage drivers and then just what your CapEx expectations are for 2021. Thank you.","Yes, Anthony. So, I think historically we've talked about very strong results as far as product on the product margin side as it relates to gross margin. And so Q4 is no different than what we talked about in Q3. It's about three quarters of the pickup is in our product margin which had a number of things that we talked about the decline in luxury mountain, the increase in the quality of product, cycling the rug business, operating the rug business at a higher margin among other things, outlet business as we talked about in MD&A and our filings. Obviously, it’s a lower promotional level. So that's where you're seeing the predominant amount of it. And then as far as CapEx for the year is concerned, you'll see in the 10-K when it's filed next week, the range that we're getting is $250 million to $300 million. That is a little higher than - this year, we ended up with sort of adjusted CapEx, you need to look at because a portion of it ends up putting it - is in op section of the cash flow. But this year we ended up at $180 million. So, then what I'll say about the elevation of the CapEx is there's a number of sort of development hills hat are happening this year that that will monetize in a future period. And then just finishing one of those stores we're opening was on a land lease. So there's just a number of factors that are just driving a higher CapEx this year including starting to spend money internationally.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

I mean I think in this previous pricing quarter we actually saw against the strength and then at the end of the quarter we saw a pretty steep drop in the pricing happen per se.

BLDR,Q3,2018,"So, I guess I want to start on the SG&A. You clearly had a lot of benefit to your top-line sales but the leverage that you saw in the quarter wasn't nearly as good as you saw it in the second quarter of around 80 basis points improvement this quarter versus 130 basis points last quarter, despite the much better top-line growth because of the lumber inflation. So, could you talk about, like, what happened in the quarter? Was there anything unique why it was a little bit less of year-over-year improvement in the third quarter relative to the second quarter?","Sure. I think you hit the nail on the head. We did have a good quarter. Sales were up. We did see leverage. We're very pleased with that. But I think your point is valid. There are some components we are seeing in our SG&A results. Some of it's real obvious. We had better profitability, so we saw increased incentive comp. That's probably the biggest piece. Another one is we pay more commissions when we have higher gross margins. So, predictably, our commission rate went up a bit. There are also some, I think, underlying expense. I think the inflation environment we're seeing is – I think it's fair to characterize that it continues to be a challenge. We called out fuel in the Q, so you'll see that. I think that's a continuing headwind. There's also a couple of internal aspects with regard to insurance. I think healthcare continues to be a headwind for us. The costs there are real and something we're battling through. And then I would say that wage inflation is a broad-based challenge for us. I think we're doing quite a good job at managing it, but it continues to be something that we see on an annual basis.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
UNVR,Q1,2017,"So, I just have one thing, not to nitpick, but on your free cash flow. So it was negative this quarter. Can you just walk through what happened there? I mean I know seasonally it's probably lower and you're going to ramp this year. But just trying to parse that out in terms of how that relates to with your M&A, if you have enough cash on hand and I think…","Sure, Andrew, thanks for that. I'd say that, to answer your last question first, yes, ample liquidity and cash on hand to more than enough to execute our acquisition strategy. In terms of the net working capital change in the first quarter, two parts to that story. Yes, as you said, the seasonal uplift which happens every year in the first quarter, sales happened in the second and third quarter, that is always amplified up in Canada with our Ag business. That's in the mix there too. But then again, in the cash flow statement you'll see that last year's first quarter we had a very large harvesting of working capital. A large portion of that was the decline of the oil and gas business at that time, kind of the peak of the decline. So tough comp, I'd say, when you look at the year-on-year cash flow of the company, and by saying that our full-year outlook of net working capital change in the $50 million to $100 million is still quite a safe bet. We, as you know, have outflow in the first, and inflow at the end of the year.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0
BLDR,Q3,2018,"So, Peter, just to be clear, that would decline, right? Yeah. Go ahead.
","Yeah. In that type of environment, the cash flow would not be impacted as much as you might think because you do have the offset of working capital less taxes. And if things look like they're slowing down, we may delay some of the CapEx too. And so it's a bit of a silver lining in the business we're in. We do, as business is growing, use up a lot of cash and working capital and investing in things like that. But as things slow, we're able to release some of those items.

The 11 points of price is actually a little better than I think you expected in the quarter, definitely better than we modeled. And then the Q4 guide even seems a tad better than we had expected. So, are the pricing tools helping there? Is there something else that's going on? Is there any change, or is this just kind of where you thought it would be?
","Well, certainly the commodity prices moving in our favor helped. We saw margin improvement in all our value-add categories this quarter, which didn't surprise me. And the pricing tool we've piloted in three or four markets and we've seen some positive results. It's really a tool we've built to make it easier and quicker for GMs to do pricing, puts a little more discipline around it, provides us better exception reporting when pricing goes outside of some predetermined levels that we set and does some customer stratification for us. So it's really just adding a level of sophistication. And we have seen some good results and we're working towards rolling that out more next year.

PM,Q1,2016,"So, my first question has to do with the negative mix shifts that we saw in the quarter. While I appreciate the more muted price realization, the negative mix in particular in the EU comes as a little bit of a surprise, given that the momentum that we're seeing in Marlboro. So can you expand on that a little bit, please?","Well, I think actually, if I talk historically, I mean, the EU had a relatively good mix, a relatively low mix. I think it's maybe there are some movements in timing of movements between our countries. I think the biggest challenge which we'll have to compete with, if you like, in the quarter was essentially coming, the lack of a pricing variance from Korea, and that's on a total PMI basis and obviously weighted quite largely on the Asia regions. If I would add a lack of the pricing – or extra gain from Korea, our revenue would be in a 4.5% growth territory and this is still despite a pretty challenging comp from Q1 over last year. So I think it's mostly the price which was driving the revenues and obviously also the bottom line there. And then obviously, you have a couple of comps which were coming from outside the EU region, that were coming mostly from the volume. I mean Russia, both total market and especially PMI performance, so they're completely different comps. And Indonesia and Asia also contributed.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

Thank you.","Yes, if don't believe we've said on prior calls. I look at a lot of these opportunities as a build versus buy decision. And at the right multiple, it makes more sense in my mind to go the M&A route, it gets you into the market quicker plus you're not adding capacity into a market which can be difficult and create some real pricing war. So, it'll be a balanced approach though, like I said, we're going to be -- we're going to be pretty busy. And it's got to make sense from a financial perspective and from a multiple perspective, but I like the fact that we have the flexibility to do either now, now that we've gotten our leverage ratio down, we can make those decisions and be, a little more opportunistic when it comes to grow in value as part of our business.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And conversely, are we at a point where you’re now getting the premiums or the early signs of premiums, particularly as it relates to Gorilla Glass and the new applications, such as NBT.

But what we like about our business hand right now is gross margins in telecom, specialty materials, life sciences, and environmental are actually improving. The corporate mix will obviously be dependent on the mix of the sales of those businesses, but the fact that all are improving leads me to believe that we have the potential to continue to move our year over year gross margins up. Obviously the most important thing for us remains display, and we must have moderate price declines. We had good price downward movement in Q2, being less than Q1. We’re expecting Q3 to be in a similar range, but we continue to believe there’s potential for price declines to moderate even further as the quarters unfold.

We are selling more of -- their rate of increase is little bit greater than our higher- priced units. So that hurts us as well as the geographic mix, because in certain parts of the world, our prices are higher than the US. So the geographic mixes and product mix is hurting us. On the cost side, we are getting favorable price exchanges. As you know, a big component of our input is stainless steel and copper and those costs are all moving favorable to us.

The bike locks, we're just going to production on those products so we'll begin shipping them the end of this – we only have another month and a half to go, but we'll begin shipping them in December as I mentioned before.

And the second was when are the trials starting right? Are these in-field clinical trials as in you're testing, in the field on live cases given these have to be self-swabbed? Is that what's causing the delay perhaps? And has the prototype for the device been locked yet? Thank you.","Yeah, Vijay, we have not announced prototype locks. So we haven't said anything about that. I do understand the interest in our product and the product development. I mentioned earlier, in response to a separate question, that we do plan to announce the submission of our EUA application, for the professional test. That's our plan right now. Beyond that we will have to see, what we'll communicate and when. There are obviously some competitive issues that would -- we have to account for, in any particular announcement. But, the delays are not due to any particular factor other than we had very high expectations, for the performance of the product. And the clinical trials are running to validate the particular design and performance of the product. So that interplay has continued and ramped up, since our August Q2 earnings call. So that will [Indiscernible] what I said before is that, we will use what we understand are the standards for the FDA targeting a self-test. And our own internal quality and performance standard as the measuring stick. And that's a very high bar, which is why it takes time to get this product on the market.

SWN,Q3,2012,"Steve, I wanted to ask you a little bit about, obviously, you managed the business to the 1.3 kind of PVI target. Obviously, you've had a very big hedging tailwind, so to speak, where you've had some very attractive hedges. But if you look on a year-over-year basis, the level of hedging gains -- decreases relative to NYMEX, and I think that's a $300 million, $400 million kind of swing factor. You do have obviously lower cost in the Fayetteville today, $2.6 million a well, plus you're drilling perhaps at prime locations. So just trying to get a sense of how all that factors in to -- you've talked about maybe 350 wells, but what you’re thinking about the Fayetteville, given the fact that you won't have as much hedging gains as in – in '12.","I think a couple of things there. First off, we are hedged, as we talked about. If we had flat production year-over-year, it would be a little over 30% hedged, and those are $5 hedges. I wouldn't assume that those are the only hedges that we have for the year. We're still looking, and I think you may see some other hedges go on. But really your question is 2013 budget and what's going to happen in 2013 budget, and we're still working on that all the way to the point -- I'm not ready to say what we think the price will be in 2013 yet. We have to sort that out. So all of that obviously works into cash flow. Cash flow obviously is partially driven by how much capital you have and you have to marry the 2 of those together, and we're not quite there yet to say how many wells we're going to drill in each area. The only thing that we've certainly committed to is because of the 2 new rigs we're adding. One’s added already, one will be added in the Marcellus that have long-term contracts on them.

GERN,Q3,2012,"Steve, maybe a first one for you, can you maybe give us a hypothesis as to why you think imetelstat was unsuccessful in the solid tumor trials?","Well, let me give you 2 completely separate hypotheses because I think it's important to distinguish what we did in breast cancer from what we did in lung cancer. In breast cancer, we combined imetelstat with paclitaxel. And what we found was that the overlapping hematologic toxicity of imetelstat with paclitaxel resulted in a required reduction in the dose of paclitaxel. That study was designed deliberately such that those modifications to paclitaxel were performed in accordance with the package insert, with the product label and so the -- unfortunately, the additional hematologic toxicity of imetelstat resulted in too much of a reduction in the paclitaxel dose in that arm, and we believe that's why patients in the imetelstat arm had a shorter progression-free survival than in the comparator arm. With regards to the non-small cell lung cancer study, I don't think we have formally declared that, that study has failed per se. What we have disclosed are 2 things. Firstly, that it -- the overall analysis failed to meet the pre-specified criteria for success and that we would be unlikely on the basis of the data we currently have to be moving directly into a Phase III study. But as Chip has pointed out, firstly there was a modest improvement in progression-free survival in the overall analysis and there are prespecified subgroup analyses ongoing, which are all based on different hypotheses. And the ones that we've talked about, I think, publicly in the past, one is the combination with bevacizumab and also some of the biologic characteristics of the tumor, which might predispose to sensitivity to imetelstat.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And are you seeing more competition, particularly on the marketing cloud side that's informing this investment?","Well, Ed, on an overall basis, we expect R&D to be, for the year, mid- to high-teens over last year, and the first quarter was really offset by an increase in the capitalization of FAS 86. We're going to continue the R&D investments in the core, big data and the integrated marketing cloud.

You have a solid business there, away from some ups and downs in apparel. At what point should we be thinking about, or -- either an investment or will you guys start to seriously think about omni channel or even a situation where returns aren't getting mailed back to the DC? And I'm curious if you guys have the systems in the DC to support this kind of shift or is this something that would have to be a multiyear investment in technology and your distribution system?","Marni, I'm going to take that question for Stuart. This is Sharen. We have had what we have called omni channel, really, in our sights and have been working on it and investing in it for the last 2 years. We are so encouraged. Well, we call it, give her what she wants. So now we have the systems in the stores to take the direct channel return. We also have the systems in the DC to take those returns. It is working very well for us. The customers have been very excited about the customer service that we have been able to provide. What it's been allowing us to do now are people that haven't bought from direct before because if you're out of stock in something in the store, you can buy from direct, and we'll have it there the next day. And now what we're seeing is moving more customers slightly to being dual-channel customers, which we now have dual-channel customers spend more with us.

And…","I think we've been pretty - yeah, Joe, that's a great question. I think we've been pretty consistent for - I joined the company in 2015. And I think we did an evaluation even by the end of 2015. We have a very strong customer base in ClearPath Forward. There is always pricing pressure. In that, we have a very strong renewal rate. That said, we do expect ClearPath Forward licensing revenue to go down marginally year after year. The rate of decline has diminished substantially in the several years that I've been here and then Mike has been here. But we do still expect that ClearPath forward licensing revenue to decline somewhat year-over-year. Now, that is offset in our Technology sector, but other licensing revenue such as Stealth licensing revenue which we expect to increase. If we take a step back and look at ClearPath Forward in its totality, not just the licensing part, but the warranty work and especially the services work we do on top of ClearPath Forward. Over the past several years, the entirety of ClearPath Forward revenue has actually been increasing. And when we look at the entirety of ClearPath Forward revenue, we expect that to be relatively stable for certainly the mid-term.

CTXS,Q3,2020,Sure. Absolutely. We had talked about last year about the revenue lift you thought over time would occur from the shift from a perpetual license to either term subscription or SaaS. Can you give any update on how you're thinking about that now that we're further in and now that you're going to be more aggressively with the end of sale of licenses how that lift is going to be -- how big that lift is going to be? Any data would be appreciated.,"Sure, Mark. There's really 2 aspects of that, that I think are important to understand. The first one is when we talk to install based customers, they're traditional Citrix customers that are moving from where they were to a Citrix Cloud. That uplift from their ongoing maintenance requirements are – it's roughly 30%, 40%. That hasn't changed. That number has been very consistent, and that's what we have been able to execute against. In terms of the overall economics, no change. Pricing has actually been remarkably stable over the last two, three quarters across our various platforms. And so the breakeven from an economic standpoint for us, whether we're selling a subscription cloud service or we're selling a perpetual license, remains just under three years from a time frame. But probably more importantly, from a strategy point of view, what that allows us to do is not only ensure customer success to a higher level, but it gives us a lower friction when we're starting to layer on incremental innovations, like our analytics services, for example, performance and security analytics, where it just becomes an add-on sale.

Do you think that weakens a bit just due to the price realization that's now coming through in the fourth quarter? Is that, again, one that could look more like cases that we saw like in Q1 and Q2, where that market was down pretty aggressively?","Yes. I mean, the Q3 market might now be influenced a little bit here and there by retailers loading some competitor volumes ahead of their price increases. So I think you'd best look at the year-to-date one. And the full year estimate is, I don't know, 15%, 18%, something in that range. So yes, it's a continued steep market decline driven by the economic situation there. It will not continue at those rates forever. We will see. We will have to wait now for a new government. We will have to wait for the measures, budgetary measures. I was mentioning VAT. We will see. Whatever the new government will want to do, the price skirmishes that we have had in the market, of course, have so far kind of prevented us to reap the benefits of earlier price increases. Well, I said the skirmishes are over, so at least that benefit should accrue now.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
ASEI,Q2,2014,"Sure. And then as I look at the $0.5 million of sequential SG&A take-out, and I'm looking first quarter to second quarter, was there something that -- I didn't realize, did you trim some costs in the quarter? I mean, I know you added some headcount with some leadership, et cetera. But -- or was there something onetime that might have been in those numbers? I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for SG&A as we look forward.","We had some charges in the first quarter, more legal related, that we did not repeat in the second quarter.

BGS,Q2,2014,"Sure. And two quick follow-up questions, the first one is around your warehousing and distribution. This is the second quarter we heard that. If you have to kind of put a benchmark of when you think it will be complete kind of what percentage of the way is the business fixed -- implemented, in your mind?","It’s the second quarter you've heard that, because it has been an ongoing issue since we did the flurry of the snack acquisitions in 2013. So it certainly had an impact in the first quarter and the second quarter. Part of the solution on the warehousing side is to get to larger facilities that can accommodate the added volume. We have already accomplished that with our Houston warehouse and we are sorting through the last of that move, and Tennessee will happen this fall and we will have done the two warehouses that really need that extra space. So I expect to start seeing cost improvement in Houston very shortly as they settle down, and then Tennessee will come towards the end of the year. On the distribution side, it's an ongoing process. As I said, we are really trying to move a decent amount of the snack volume to direct shipments out of co-packers, that will help us tremendously in distribution and warehousing and we needed to just get more efficient in terms of negotiating with our carriers as well. I mean, part of our added costs is inescapable and that its rate increases the carriers have put in place. As little we can do about that in a lot of cases. But there is probably 60% to 75% of the increases we are seeing that we can manage down and are doing that now.

PM,Q1,2016,"Sure. I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you. And then the other question I had was just in relation to the development of iQOS. And you've had this very strong development in Japan, but a slower development in countries like Italy and Switzerland, where it's been around about the same amount of time. And you talked about some – a couple of the undertakings by the company to enhance the development of iQOS, say, in Italy or Switzerland. I just wanted to understand, is that about spending more money? Are you doing more embassies or stores in those markets? Just what you're doing to try and boost the national expansion, if you will, and the adoption of the product in markets where it just hasn't developed at the same rate as Japan.","I think we need to adjust for the marketing and the overall commercial environment which we have in Japan versus what we've had in Switzerland or Italy or many other places. And this is – covers the trade channels, what I call route to the customer, route to the trade, et cetera. So I think we're adjusting this one and trying to figure it out such a composition of the – all available to our blogs, which were the result. We've had manageable level of spending, if you like, versus the conversion rates which we can achieve. Now, Italy is – I think we're going to crack the Italy also this year. And I remain very positive on this despite the fact that for the couple of quarters, they're all – we're talking about the 0.2% market share. I mean that's not much of an issue I think, frankly speaking, in this stage. If I look what we have achieved and achieving in part of Switzerland and as you noticed, we, in some places, going deliberately very focused in order to nail down the model properly on the smaller territory, and then when we feel comfortable, we explode. I mean, let me remind you, I mean, we had, as you remember, the market shares conversions rate which we had at Nagoya at the time of the city test, right, of the test market. And no one at – if you were to look at that progression of the share development in Nagoya, you wouldn't figure it out that we can accelerate the conversions and the market share to the levels which we have in the 60% of Japan, including Tokyo and other main cities. So I think we're trying to get comfortable in the smaller territory that we know that we can amplify it and explode, and – or amplify the right components of our marketing mix, broadly marketing mix, and then we go to the national level. And it's actually – it's in a part of a, obviously, higher cost spend, higher investment, but more prudently invested into something which really gives you a proper result. So – and I am excited about Japan, but very excited about Switzerland, and I am sure we're going to demonstrate later on this year, what we can do in Italy as well.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
BLDR,Q3,2018,"Sure. Okay. That's fair. And I guess one last one. Peter, in the past, we've talked about some internal working capital initiatives. Working capital is a little better than we thought and lumber is likely going to help that. But what's the way to think about working capital? I know there was a question earlier about the impact of falling lumber and you're going to have a tailwind. But how do we think about it given maybe some of those initiatives on top of falling lumber as we move out into next year?","Yeah. Fair question. I think that the work that we've done around working capital is more a matter of structural discipline and a continuing focus on it to make sure that it never gets out of control, and we're still in that 9% to 10% range. I think that there are some specific examples that I can give you of success stories on a location-by-location basis. The dynamics that I think is challenging for the quarterly metric or for the ongoing metric is the in-month ups and downs, the nature of what we hold for our customers, the nature of how we have product on the ground at different valuations for projects or specific ordering profiles. It's a little bit harder to point to a specific quarter or a trend move, but I do see the benefits of the organization in what we do on a location-by-location basis by that focus. And I'm not quite ready to change our guide on that, but I think it will be part of the tailwind that we see coming to the back end of this year. And as we look at the year-over-year comps for working capital use into 2019, I think we'll see it as well.

CTXS,Q3,2020,"Thank you and congratulations on the good quarter. I think people should be surprised at how well that's going. Can you give us up -- 2 questions, I guess. Can you give us an update on the economics of the subscription cloud transition? Are you seeing -- you talked last year about a revenue lift from a license moving to a subscription versus license to SaaS. Is that still how you're thinking about that? And then as a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on the Microsoft expanded partnership? I know that's still early. You mentioned a win. How do you think that's going to impact that shift and the speed of the shift to SaaS? Thanks.","Yes. Mark, let's start with the Microsoft piece. As we've talked about really for 20 years, I mean, this has been an amazing partnership and what we do to embrace and extend the Microsoft set of technologies. Earlier this year, we obviously took that to a more strategic level than we've ever had in the past and the overall objective of helping our customers transform it. In this case, it means Transform Citrix Cloud and Azure. And so I'd say that we're continuing to operationalize some of the new elements of that, the areas where we're selling together, we're developing joint solutions. But in terms of the overall execution, it's going really well. I called out to Phil's question, a big natural resources company. But there's also a lot of other examples already in Q3, a big state university where it is a WD plus Citrix to address students, in fact, of the use cases. One of the biggest stock exchanges around the world, which was a long time Citrix customer going through that exact migration. They're working on the cloud migration to Azure, and we're doing that together. And so I think the benefit of bringing together multiple partners just helps abstract away a lot of the complexity for customers. So the closer we can work together with a lot of the great partners like Microsoft, it makes their journey easier. And so I think it's really -- it's a win-win for everybody when we do that. So we're going to continue to operationalize throughout Q4. And we'll just – each quarter, we'll talk about some of these great wins we're doing together. Can you repeat the other parts of your question?",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TTE,Q4,2021,"Thank you and good afternoon. And hopefully, the March 24 presentation, we will manage to see each other in-person. Two questions, if I could. The first one was on the integration side and the Total being multi-energy. Can you actually talk us through the economics of something like the Iraq project? And is that sort of saying the best example of where multi-energy really works for Total. And then secondly, on the renewable side, you talked about kind of the business now being in over 70 countries. I was wondering at what point do you think that -- how much you need to focus that business and is more geography actually better? Or is there specific areas you kind of think that where you need to focus on. And then just very lastly, just to pick up on the cash return. You mentioned the share price earlier. Is the -- so is the buyback level dependent actually now on the share price?","Last question, yes, there is a level where obviously it become too expensive. So I don't want to cap the share price hike, let's be clear. But there might be an arbitration between having the debt going down, keeping the money. And then because we know the markets will be volatile. The best buybacks for our investors and for the company, the best investment in buybacks is to buy the shares when the share is low -- when the share is very high. So we -- the Board will obviously monitor that. There is no -- I mean, don't ask me a mathematical solution. There is no magic there. It's just a question of monitoring it because I have already met a lot of investors which criticized us somewhere sometimes when we buy but it's high. So why not keeping the money and then using it when the share is low. We would have more -- last year, it was not possible. It was a year when the share was at EUR 30 per share. But I know some investors who bought some shares at this level, we are not able to do it as a company. So that's a point where, just a remark.

On the economic benefits on the integration but there are several ones. One of them in particular, in the case of Iraq and we are using that in other oil countries, is that when you have developers willing to develop large projects in these emerging countries, they are all asking to -- when you are a small developer, they want some sovereign guarantees. When you are an oil and gas company and you receive revenues from a state, larger revenues, let's be clear, the revenues from oil compared even to what we want to do in Iraq, the magnitude of the power of revenues is not the same. You can find a way to, I would say, guarantee your electricity revenues by the oil revenue. So there is a link there which is a good leverage in terms of economic benefits and possibility to make the projects. And so I mean -- and same -- at the end of the day, the gas resources which we have leveraged are also part of, I would say, an extensive contract service. Contracts, is -- I will not call that. I don't know what is the name of the contract in Iraq. I don't remember. But it's part of -- you can use like, we've done in other countries, like it was done, for example, in Qatar by Shell with GTL. You can use revenues of one to leverage the investment in the other. So that's the beauty of it, if are able to invest in different projects, then it's a question of managing the different parameters of the contract.

Yes. The advantage to be in more countries for renewables is that there are less competitors. I will tell you the advantage is that, first, we are there. We know the country. We have a presence. We have some people working already in marketing and services, in E&P. So we have a knowledge of authorities. They respect us. We have an image. So it's good because we have a trust, I would say, you build on the trust. The second part is that most of the developers have -- of course, the smaller ones, you have some small companies. But the larger, I would say, utilities are focused on some countries, mainly, the large countries which offer PPAs which is not the case, of course, of all these emerging countries or the ID what we are is, of course, it's complex in some of the smaller countries but the profitability can be higher. So this is what we are looking for to have direct negotiation to be able to leverage, I would say, what it can bring to the country in order to have a better profitability.

So -- and I think this is an advantage of a company like TotalEnergies. We are present in many countries. There is longer service relationship, we can leverage it. We call them renewable explorers. They will not replace our real explorers but they will bring some good profits in the future.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
HAE,Q4,2014,"Thank you and good morning and I appreciate all the detail that you’ve provided this morning. I wanted just to start with the whole blood business. I guess sort of implied, and Brian you have walked through this a couple of times in your fiscal ‘16 mid single-digit growth targets, sort of half the business growing at a double-digit rate which would say half the business flat. I guess I'm just trying to understand a couple of moving parts here on the whole blood side. On the one hand, you have the adjustment of utilization rate in the U.S. But if I take a step back it seems like globally there is a continued trend to minimally invasive surgery conversion to laparoscopy in emerging markets, et cetera, that would seem to put sustained downward pressure on the business on a global basis. Can you maybe just help me think through that first?","Sure. Well think about a global -- global whole blood or global blood collection market, because roughly 90 million collections worldwide, about 45 million of those are in the leukoreduced collection, and that's really the market that we look at, we target. So if you think about the U.S. being 12 million of that, you can see where we look at the remaining part of this market being much bigger. And leukoreduction is increasing, even in emerging markets our customers are looking at implementing leukoreduced technology because it produces a better red cell product at the end of the day. So we're seeing the leukoreduced market continue. We’re going to see the overall 90 million contract as part of what we're seeing today but you’re going to see the leukoreduced grow as a part of that become a big piece of it, but then you’re going to see that 90 million start to grow again. I don't expect it's going to have growth like we see in the plasma market today. But it’s going to grow because when you think about it, about half the world's population, when you look at emerging markets, sits in those markets and they can't meet demand today for their populations. Now that demand isn’t there but it's increasing, if you think about the U.S. market alone, 12 million collections for 300 people, China today has about 25 million collections for a 1.2 billion plus. So you can see that today they're not meeting the demand for their blood. So we expect that to continue to grow and we expect importantly leukoreduced portion of that to continue to grow. And that’s why we stay so committed to this and focused on this and believe our strategy is the right strategy.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GCI,Q3,2009,"Thank you and welcome back, Craig. My question is on the cost side -- if you could share with us what your preliminary thinking is on the costs for next year. Is the decline we saw in this quarter a good run-rate for next year? And did you have the furloughs? Did the furloughs continue into Q3 and what are your thoughts going forward? And maybe also touch on the newsprint -- have you stockpiled an above average amount given the possibility of some price increases ahead?","You know, Alexia, it’s a little early for us to comment on the cost side for next year. We are literally just beginning to look at the budgets that are bubbling up from our local units. What I will tell you is that a lot will depend on what the revenue outlook is for next year. I don’t think we assume that the revenue outlook next year is going to be quite as difficult as it was this year but we’ll have to take a look at that and then some of the expense initiatives that we’ve done are ongoing and permanent reductions. We’ll cycle some of those but then there have been new ones, obviously, in July and beyond that will benefit us well into next year. We did not do furloughs in the third quarter nor do we have plans to do furloughs in the fourth quarter, so that about $25 million of expense benefit that we received in the second quarter, and I guess it was about $20 million or so in the first quarter, did not repeat in the third quarter, nor will it repeat in the fourth quarter. On the newsprint side, I would say that we’ve always done a good job on the inventory management side and given where prices are buttressed by some black liquor tax credits that some of the newsprint companies have enjoyed, we certainly have added to our inventory levels, as have others, I’m sure, in the industry.",2.0,0.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thank you for taking my question. Can you give us a sense of when you started to see the weakness emerged and how you feel about your long-term targets given the price pressure? Are you updating what you think margins can reach in several of your timeframe?
","Yes. Let me start with the first part of the question. It was really pressure that we saw throughout Q3. Typically Q3 for us tends to be a less linear quarter because of the summer and normally month three tends to be the stronger part of Q3 even compared to normal linearity. For us this quarter throughout we noticed that there was more competitive intensity and certainly that carried on through month three. Now on the question of how do we think about our long-term, even in a quarter where we've had aggressive racing action by competitors, our gross margin is well above our target norms. So it's our product gross margin that held up well even in an environment that is intense competitive intensity. So we are not changing what our belief is about our long-term gross margin model. Secondly when you look at our mature commercial teams, they are operating well above breakeven levels of productively. So we already know that there is a marketing investment support the kind of business model that we are trying to build. What I think you are really seeing is a transition in the marketplace and not – and that's really what's causing sort of more probation in the short-term. We are not changing our perspective on what the long-term business model looks like.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,1.0,2.0

PM,Q1,2016,"Thank you for taking the question. I'd just like to come back to the question about what's driving the much better than historic volumes in the European Union. And you've obviously mentioned four factors, but I'm just wondering – and you've said it's really impossible or hard to quantify the impact from migration. But I guess what I'm trying to ask is what the evidence is, how good the evidence is of the impact from reduced illicit and whether – and what sort of evidence you have, and whether you can quantify this in any way. And also quantify the impact of reduced headwind from E-Vapor.","Well, I think we get a better reading at the market or on the total region level when it comes to the illicit trade. I mean it's obviously always an estimate, well, because the methodologies were equally applied from year-on-year. I think we have a better comfort about saying that, yes, there is a contributions of the illicit trade. And that contributions goes in a, I guess, in a – well, it depends now versus what period, but you're talking about the few couple points of growth is coming from illicit trade. Now, you will have to zoom into Germany, which presumably has a much larger impact than, for example, UK when the illicit trade is still on the growth. Italy had good results. I mean, Southern Europe actually is doing better. As you know, the recent moves also over the last few months of some reinforcing the border controls or reintroducing, actually, the border controls in between that, some EU states, EU market and also outside, I mean, they clearly are another factor which also contributes to tightening the domestic tax paid market. I always give a example of Turkey, which I know is outside Europe, but Turkey has reduced illicit trade year-on-year by about 10 points, 11 points, which is about half. I mean Turkish market normally wouldn't be growing – or Turkish consumption, if you like, wouldn't be growing by 10% or 11%. We're talking about the industry tax paid volumes growing to this magnitude, and this is clearly the recovery coming from a 10 points, 11 points almost of the recovery from illicit trade. So, yes, you'll see the correlations. And – but I said to one of the questions earlier, it's more comfortable for us to talk about the illicit trade because there's quite a lot of data available or estimates available, and you can deduct with a high dose of a probability that this is a contributing factor. Immigration is more something which we hear about from a – reading the newspapers, et cetera. But clearly, there are movements in this location of population, immigrations, et cetera.

RH,Q4,2020,Thank you so much for taking my questions and congrats to the team on the very strong results. I do have two quick questions. The first one is could you share some details on the distribution center that's coming on live in terms of what would be the incremental rent or incremental operating expense to run it or the incremental CapEx to build it? Any details around that would be helpful.,"Yes, it's all in our model. I don't know if we're disclosing individual rents of DCs and stuff like that but it’s all in our models. It’s all in our projection. It’s all in our plan. And the CapEx is modest as it relates to the 250 to 300. I gave you. It’s a non-event. Like anytime you have a DC, there's a little step up here. So we’re in a step up here but we're absorbing that cost. And so we'll - it’s probably in the first year it's a bit of a drag on occupancy.

EXPE,Q2,2021,"Thank you so much. So, Peter, I think you wanted to kind of talk about potential permanent changes to consumer behavior. I think vacation rentals versus a hotel are fairly well understood. but are you noticing any change in terms of folks favoring agency versus merchant because I'm sure they probably learned last year they're paying ahead of time and trying to get refunds later on? It's probably something that they probably don't want to do again. So, are there kind of sort of meaningful differences in the conversion rate between the 2 types of transactions you can call out? And does that positively or negatively influence your customer acquisition strategies going forward? Thanks.
","Yeah. And I will just add, Stephen, that we're not trying to drive, as Eric said, we're not trying to drive the customer to any particular outcome. We provide choices by and large. And what the customers do, what they want. There has been a relative bias during COVID for pay later. As you say perhaps, I could later do something security around the idea. But there's nothing that I think suggests that that's necessarily a permanent thing. I don't think we know enough yet and we'll see as we come out of COVID, but certainly, we've seen merchant rebound considerably and that may well persist.",0.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
EXPE,Q2,2021,"Thank you so much. So, Peter, I think you wanted to kind of talk about potential permanent changes to consumer behavior. I think vacation rentals versus a hotel are fairly well understood. but are you noticing any change in terms of folks favoring agency versus merchant because I'm sure they probably learned last year they're paying ahead of time and trying to get refunds later on? It's probably something that they probably don't want to do again. So, are there kind of sort of meaningful differences in the conversion rate between the 2 types of transactions you can call out? And does that positively or negatively influence your customer acquisition strategies going forward? Thanks.
","Yeah. I'll take the front end of that as well. I would think about it about merchant and agency that we have seen continued. I think we talked about this a couple of quarters ago. waiting for the agency side of the businesses, consumers want more flexibility, but ultimately, what they're looking for is that flexibility. So, it's more of non-refundable -- refundable is that what they are looking for given the uncertainty in the environment. And, Peter, feel free to add. But that hasn't necessarily changed our customer acquisition strategy, our strategy, or whatever else in the end where our marketplace is running a travel Company. And our job here is to meet with customers and what they're looking for that meets the needs and the use cases that they have and I will continue to do that. But as I said on the front end, and there is continued waiting to the refundable side and the agency side.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
HAS,Q1,2021,"Thank you very much and good morning. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about the video game business at the moment, particularly MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena mobile launch. Maybe you could talk -- give a little bit of color about how just many downloads occurred, maybe the global representation there and how much it's potentially expanding the funnel of players? And then secondly, it looks like the hot new consumer product out there is NFTs. And given that you have a lot of collectible business, have you thought much about what might make sense in the NFT business?"," Sure. Let me start by talking a bit about Wizards and Digital Gaming, and we'll begin with Magic Arena. We have really seen an acceleration of Magic Arena in the first quarter. We went to full mobile launch just at the end of the quarter at March 25th.
It's available both on Android and iOS, and that Arena is up 24% versus a year ago, where we've now seen about 3.5 billion games played collectively since the beginning and the launch. The average per hour use and gameplay for the week is now back to trending at nine hours per week. As you know, we're launching a whole array of card sets that are also simultaneously for MAGIC analog and digital. And we really saw great success in the first quarter around Kaldheim.
In fact, that launch, which is clearly February was the biggest winter set of all time for MAGIC, and Time Spiral was also in the quarter, and that was also very successful. As we move forward now with Magic Arena up on both iOS and Android, we'll now be entering second quarter, in fact, just launching in April, on the 23rd, Strixhaven, which is a brand-new world for MAGIC: THE GATHERING; the big new card release that will come in June, Modern Horizons, will really drive Q2's business, and there's a lot of excitement around that. And then by July, we also have another release coming for the brand. So we're really seeing an acceleration of downloads.
In fact, it's as good or even better than the team had anticipated. People are really enjoying the play. And this has translated very well to the mobile format, and we'll continue to monitor and look at what appears to be an accelerating MAGIC business. The NFT is a real opportunity for us.
As you know, we have so many brands that really operate on multiple demographic levels, whether it's the TRANSFORMERS or the MAGIC and D&D brands, brands like G.I. Joe. And we have a team that's leading our effort out of the West Coast. We have really our arms around this and see multiple opportunities on the NFT side, and you'll hear more about that as we move forward.
But we are actively developing our opportunity here, and we do see it as substantial.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And then I have a follow-up, thank you.","Generally speaking, after the earthquake we have a downward pressure to our production. So – most of our product lines, including cameras, inkjet, laser printers and copiers, is in shortage in our inventories.

BMY,Q1,2021,"Thank you very much for taking the questions. And congratulations on the start to the year. I know it's late in the call, but thank you for taking the questions. And I'll keep this brief.
A question we get a lot from investors is how to think about the multiple myeloma franchise over the next couple of years and your market share collectively within that. Obviously, you have some moving pieces with Revlimid with some offsets to the backlog. But the specific question, I guess, is, where is your team looking in terms of some of the new agents that the clinical community is becoming more interested in, such as iberdomide? And how do you think that can move into a commercial setting as an offset to some of the headwinds you may face in the space? Thank you.
","Yeah. Thank you. So you've very correctly asked about multiple myeloma strategy. We are leaders in multiple myeloma, of course, continuing to build on the heritage of the image where we've pioneered in that space.
We do have the broadest portfolio, and now we are beginning to see the results of that with the approval of Abecma. But the way we look at it is a three-pronged approach. On one side, we have the CELMoDs, which have the potential to allow for us to replace the image over time with a near-term opportunity for iberdomide reading out this year in the fourth line plus setting. And then, the second CELMoD 480 reading out in 2022.
The second strategy is the BCMA targeting. Abecma already approved, and we have the investigation ongoing for T-cell engager, as well as the ADC targeting. The third pillar is, of course, the combination. And you will see beginning this year already the studies of CELMoDs in the earlier line setting in the one to two prior lines of therapy.
And then, we will continue to build on the other combinations as well. So we feel overall really good about our position by having these multiple modalities. And we are confident that we can continue to build on our leadership position going forward in that space.

TAP,Q3,2008,"Thank you very much. A couple of follow ups if I could. Kevin, first on Canada, you talked about early fourth quarter STRs being unchanged, so that’s a deceleration. Do you think that’s on the back of stronger pricing in Ontario and perhaps Quebec, or are you seeing maybe some trade down impact, either away from or towards other categories? What are you seeing there in the early part of the quarter?","I’d say from an industry perspective, the 3.1 was a pretty heated industry and reflected a couple things. It reflected in Quebec a bit of an inventory build, to be honest, and it also reflected early in the quarter. You may recall last quarter I spoke about the timing of the Canada Day holiday, so adjusting for that I think it’s really the third quarter that’s a little bit inflated rather than the fourth quarter. I characterize October as okay, not bad, not great, but in an industry where historically we’ve been at about 1% growth, flat for us is probably a pretty good performance given all the circumstances in the marketplace right now.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0
MNST,Q3,2012,Thank you very much. A couple of questions here. It sounds like with all the extra -- you talked about the improved profitability on the international business. It sounds like with all the extra costs with Japan and everything that Europe might have seen a relatively significant increase in profitability. Is that a fair analysis to make coming out of your comments?," I wouldn’t say significant, I think it had a nice increase in bottom line and they are all continuing to improve the effectiveness in Europe but we are still got a lot of individual countries where we are at the very early stages of developing the brand as a result we continue to divest quite heavily in trade development personnel, South personnel, sampling in order to make sure the product, the companies established in each of these countries. Although the – Europe again is not one country like America, each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales team, different support in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand and that becomes costly until you get to a sort of at least a minimum level of sales in that country and then things will start kicking in. Because we’ve got some really good shares in small countries but it’s costly. In countries like Lithuania, and last year we were up to 15% market share but when you look at it in actual case terms its very small. So to support that get the product established there has been expensive but it is starting to kick in on its own. We’ve got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of those smaller markets in the east and then there were others that also sort of we just are still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are all continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those areas they will continue to improve. We are also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with your marketing spend to support the brand. A lot of the international properties that we started with in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid obviously increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spend per case lower. It is going the right way. It’s happened for the last two years and so now we believe we are going forward.  We will be able to start showing better bottom line coming out of Europe.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Is that something that you could add to kind of the main line Nu.Q colorectal cancer assay especially while the U.S. EDR and studies on pause?,"Absolutely. So actually, and that is it is not necessarily a bad thing. We have been big on polls, gives us more time to adapt the platform. I mean, getting a colorectal panel is a lot of work. And we can add those assets to it. Absolutely. And we are actually looking for it is been proven very helpful in biomarker discovery. So that one, and that we are certainly looking at others as well. I have never been described as being different. And from the mass spectrometry, it certainly appears they are, so we can 100% add any assay theoretically, and because what we have is a bit of a process now where we can make the recombinant nucleosomes the antibody in-house and make the assay. So the short answer is absolutely.

TTE,Q4,2021,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Congratulations on what were very strong results. I had 2 questions, please, on distribution policy. Firstly, on the buyback, if you could please clarify the timing or the phasing of the $2 billion buyback you announced for the first half of the year? And then in terms of visibility in the future buyback, should we anticipate you announcing the amount twice a year? My second question on the 5% dividend increase. You had previously indicated last year that dividend increases would depend on a structural increase in cash flows. And today, you attribute the dividend increase to a structural increase in cash flow from LNG and electricity. Can we read into that, that you anticipate LNG and power markets to continue to remain tight throughout 2022?","Thank you, Irene, for your kind words. I would say, first, the timing, I just mentioned it in my speech. Clearly, it will be executing during the first half of 2022 because the Board of Directors was want also to look what is the share price. We will not buy if the shares continue to grow. There is a certain point. So it's why we also want to have a program on the first half. So Jean-Pierre and his team will execute $2 billion in the coming months with the rules, of course, during the windows in which we can intervene in the markets. So that's the first. Second, I mean, let's -- the Board wants to monitor that according to -- we'll see, we could expect maybe more cash flows coming, more surplus cash flow. So it will be at least twice a year. It may be -- it could be -- I would say, it depends on the Board. It could be even modified after the first quarter results but let's see. The technical answer is at least twice a year. So don't consider but the $2 billion is only for the year. There is no hidden agenda. It's just for first half and then we'll see. But in the past, each time we have announced a long buyback program, we were interrupted by some events on the market. So let's be prudent, let's execute. So -- but you can consider that if the environment remains as it is, it will be at least the $2 billion for the second part, if not more.

On the dividend, I would say, I mean -- no, again, what means from structural CFFO or underlying long-term CFFO, it means that it comes from some volume increase, from something which is sustainable. It does not come from the actual prices. The impact on the prices, we know that it's volatile, is reported in what we call the surplus cash flow. So when -- if -- and we increased the dividend by 5% because we consider that we are in a growth trajectory. I'll remind you that in September, like we previously reminded you but we are in a trajectory where the cash flow should grow by $5 billion at the same environment. And so it's the first tranche of this $5 billion for the next 5 years. If you remind us, as you follow us very carefully, I think in 2018 or 2019, we had already that in mind. Of course, when the events with the crisis have disrupted everything and we have already announced that if we have an extra $1 billion, we would allocate more or less 5% increase on the dividend.

So we are coming back on the trajectory on which we were before. But it's not linked to we believe that the price will remain. It's linked to in, I would say, conservative environment, we consider that, I would say, these -- the 6 million tons extra volume LNG are there for long and even royalty is that we will continue to increase because we have a growth trajectory. So this is a basis of the increase of the dividend. It's something which can be sustained independently of, I would say, very high oil prices but in a conservative environment.

Having said that, to answer to your question, I think that the LNG target will remain tight for a few years. If you remind as well, Irene, I knew that in 2018, 2019, people were speaking about oversupply but they were forgetting is by '24, '25. In fact, we already announced by '22, '23 and I would say even '24 with the COVID impact, we don't see much trends coming on stream. It's easy to anticipate. And we continue to see, by the way, high demand. The only point on the demand where we have to be prudent for LNG that if the price remains at $20, I'm a little afraid of the negative impact it will have on some emerging markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, even India -- so that's why I'm prudent on the LNG side in terms of anticipation. Because, again, gas is competing for coal. And if gas remains too high, coal will come back despite the climate change or coal will not exit, more exactly.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to just start with a question about the, I guess, comparing and contrasting it a little bit, maybe a little weaker than we had -- some of us had modeled. And, I guess, due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong, so 28 to 30% growth for the year.
Maybe you could just sort of lay out the year a little bit at a high level? And just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1? Thanks.
","Sure. So with that, we're pretty excited about 2020. It's a strong year for us, certainly, with, you know, the expectations of being around 28 to 30% revenue growth. We do expect all of our businesses to grow.
I think, relative to the Q1 guide, if you look at Q1 as an absolute number, it is up over 40% year on year, even with semi-custom revenues, you know, very low in Q1. And so, that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business. From a sequential basis, Q4 to Q1, it's what we said on the call. There is some bit of normal seasonality, just as we are consumer-focused in our PC portfolio.
So, you expect that that would go down from Q4 to Q1. And then we do have the factor that the semi-custom profile, when we're doing a product transition, has the revenue very low in Q1. You know, it starts ramp in Q2, but it's very heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So, you should think about semi-custom for this year, again, it's a ramp year, so it's a little bit different, that over 80% of the revenue for semi-custom will be in the second half of the year, compared to the first half of the year.
So overall, we think a very strong year. A little bit of reprofiling of revenue, particularly as it relates to semi-custom. And you know, we look forward to executing it.

You did talk about the relationship on the preferred side for Medicare with United, but is there anything else that's specifically driving that would be my first question? And then secondly, you talked a little bit about the incremental costs around some of these pilot programs et cetera, but are you starting to see any benefit from some of these pilots and initiatives in the 2020 guidance that you're giving?","Morning. Yeah, I think with regarding prescription growth we see a return to normal market in Med D driven by the fact that we got preferred relationships with some of the bigger plans. And we may have lost some of the small preferred access, but they are very small numbers otherwise. So, overall, we feel pretty good about that. You saw an announcement with Centene, where we intend to be more proactive in the Medicaid space going forward as well. There's still areas that we're working on. First of all, we are able to retain more customers. For example, I mentioned Save a Trip Refill in our prepared remarks. That's driving better retention adherence.And last not least, of course, we are able to consolidate pharmacies, not just Rite Aid but the marketplace is changing. We're seeing more pharmacies than normal on the marketplace. And we have a good pipeline of pharmacies that we'll be able to secure in the future and consolidate as the number of pharmacies in the U.S. for the first time for a long time seem to be in decline.

Let me give you – I'll give you a quick answer and let Alex then take the more detailed one. Our point on the scripts is, if you take the second half versus first half the scripts are now running at second half 4%. And we had as you know a very weak first half. We were up 1.9%. And that's because we were lapping these call it network changes, where we lost two points in the previous 12 months.And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative. We build in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans. They're quite sizable, so we do expect returns this current year on cash flow.On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of income in 2020. These will be building over the next three years and it depends on the success. Any one of them can become significant upside.

ANET,Q1,2020,"Thank you very much. Jayshree, I was hoping you could give us some insight into the way enterprise executives are thinking about conditions, what they're thinking about in terms of? How they're approaching spending? You made a comment that I think is probably accurate, which is you're more concerned about COVID in the back half.And I assume that’s not supply chain related. It's more demand related. I would assume that you've done a lot of calls with top executives at firms. What are they saying to you about the business in process, the programs that are already in place are getting completed.But maybe the pipeline is falling off as you exit the second quarter and that there expectations for spending in the back half may be hard to put it any other way, sharply constrained?","Right. So Alex, that's a good question. I think our enterprise decision-makers and key executives are struggling within once in 100-year phenomena, just the way we are, right? They all do have 2020 plans and deadlines. And they would very much like to work with Arista and overcome the supply constraints to meet them. And I believe they will.I believe they'll also take -- many of them will also take not just a 2020 horizon, but a multiyear horizon. And start thinking about how to plan for projects in this virtual world. So we do see some systematic prudent planning. And while we don't have visibility to that demand, we don't think demand will be challenged significantly if they plan prudently.Where we think demand will be challenged, like I said before, is new projects. People are familiar with Arista, people who have to do a lot more testing with Arista, people who love Arista, but haven't had a chance yet to get their hands on it.So that part of enterprise customers – may be more comfortable with doing nothing or being as is.

I think the success of Tri Tip, which has been really, really successful, has actually challenged our operators a little bit in regards to maybe just making sure they're prepping it and so forth so there's maybe some -- a little bit more inefficiencies around getting Tri Tip in place in Q2 and I think we've worked ourselves through that but those are probably two things going into Q2 that maybe were a little bit more challenging than maybe we were anticipating going in.",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,2.0,2.0
NWSA,Q2,2011,"Thank you, good afternoon. Chase I just want to take up a little bit more on how you are thinking about monetizing the content at Fox in particular? Disney did a deal with Netflix and I think the press reports were sort of $150 million to $200 million for a year’s worth of programming and I’d argue most of that value if that number is close to right and it accrues to ABC, so how do you feel about that kind of a deal with Fox just in terms of making prior season shows available online and whether it's Netflix or Fox.com or Hulu? There’s been that argument from the Turner folks that Modern Family being available on Hulu made it less attractive for them. Just wanted to get your thought process and strategy on using these platforms to built value at Fox’s TV studio and at the network?","I think for content owners having players like Netflix emerge and certainly has real pop to it to the sense they are another buyer of our product. And I think that’s largely with somebody like, I just think with Fox.com which is like the I think it’s the line is soft of currencies and products which is really more where the fox.com reside and sort of a delayed access to current product which is different than sort of the, where the Netflix (Inaudible) which is more what I consider library product. I mean product and with the effort and they may all, obviously those things can change but I do think they are different and to the degree Netflix is like a deal item. I read the Disney deal, I don’t remember the specific product, but to the degree it’s where you talk Moderate Family. To the degree they are looking to compete for sort of library rights. I think largely they are competing with other sort of network type buyers and I think increasingly you are going to have, when the competitor is not co-sharing, there’ll be competitors. And I think probably channels like to say if I’m going to pay a lot of money for Modern Family I want to buy it upright but it’s not showing up on a competing platform. At least I know what it is for adjusting my value and I think for us as a buyer because we’re a buyer as well in FX, I would not be buying reruns, indication rights to a an expensive piece of programming and letting it go reside on Netflix for 20 million copies up. Yeah I think that’s, the place they reside it is, I think how I look at it. We have to make sure that we’re getting fair value for our product. We shouldn’t be selling it cheap and I think at times people have sold their products cheap. I think the Star’s deal with Netflix is probably the ultimate example of product being sold beyond cheap. And I think we can get fair value for our products. There are other buyer for our product and other medium for our product. You may have to set a few merge to library values where you have cable channel syndication and digital networks that are competing for these rights. And I think the buyer is always right after you shake out. I know how, we are a buyer on the FX side. I know how we’ll approach it and we are going to, I think we will certainly look at all those in distribution platforms and address what we’re willing to bid or what we are willing to bid or what we’re willing pay based on where it’s being distributed. So, I think that’s how I look at it.

So we have got some new authorizations. We have some in Europe. We've actually jus won one in the U.S. this week. It's very early days for us in the U.S., but it's all about our win/loss ratio. Give the suppliers a compelling value proposition then they will come with us. And we're getting good feedback so far.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
UNVR,Q1,2017,"Thank you, good morning everyone. I was wondering if you're already seeing some market share gain among suppliers. Are you realizing maybe more new authorization on product sales or are we still working on for now on the pruning phase, and maybe just sell more big products?","So, we are getting some new authorizations. And we're getting those in various parts of the world. This is something David's been working very hard on. In order to do that, it goes beyond just the simple trusting relationship that you have; you've got to show them some data. You've got to show them that you're able to grow your business again, and that you can grow their business for them. And that's why it's so important that we focus on new business wins out there, and change the mindset of our sales force. This is what David is working -- we're all working really hard on, to get people to have better skill sets, to be more effective and more efficient in the execution of their sales call, to increase the amount of new business that we gain. This turning point for the first time in eight quarters of having growth in the U.S., those are the kinds of things that help us get more authorizations from our existing suppliers as well as those that we're pursing that we don't have relationships with. David, you want to add anything to that?",2.0,2.0,2,0.0,1.0,2.0
HLX,Q2,2010,"Thank you, good morning gentlemen. I guess, the first thing I would ask you is, if you look at the quarter and you look at the gross margins were real solid on the contracting services side, is there anything abnormal. Obviously there is a workload which is abnormal but from a profitability perspective is there anything sort of abnormal in there, that would make this sort of an unsustainably high level?"," Well, I think first and foremost contracting services high margins you saw are influenced great deal by high utilization of well intervention. That was a primary factor each time we have 98% utilization of well intervention you’re going to drive high margins. On the other hand our margins in subsea construction were relatively on the low side, I mean it’s mixed up in there, they’re relatively on low side, because the Caesar performed a low margin flotel job during the third quarter and as Owen mentioned earlier, it’s just kind of two of its first pipelay job.
I’d say that certainly HP was a helpful factor to our margins because the work she is doing for BP its sort of the margins it was keeping margins out of oil and gas, as it would have been contributing on the oil and gas side by having Phoenix production. So yes I would say net-net, Steve the margins for contracting services were positively influenced because of utilization in the HP I contribution, at the same time like I said it stole some margins out of oil and gas.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

TECD,Q4,2008,"Thank you, good morning. Just a follow-up on that acquisition comment you just made, do you see the opportunities in Europe being greater than those in America or any comments on where maybe because if you go back to history, these times have led to roll-up opportunities that have gotten the large players to their size today. So, any additional color on where they might be and even what type of -- are you looking for the software networking type company that actually are growing in this environment, or do you try and perceive the market into other areas that could be growing in three years or something?","Richard, it's the combination of the two strategies you just articulated. Clearly, strategy number one for us is to leverage our fixed cost infrastructure as effectively as we can. And so when we can roll-up market opportunity into our cost structure, it improves the yield of our infrastructure and our profitability. Last year we rolled Scribona up in the Nordics, we rolled Actavis up in Switzerland and both of those acquisitions have helped make those geographies more productive and more profitable and they can serve customers and vendors more effectively.

We also have our sight set on opportunities that diversify our business more effectively. It doesn’t only have to happen through acquisitions. Last year for example, we added VMware to our line card and it represented a multi-million dollar relationship in the year for us, pure incremental opportunity. We continue to look for other diversification opportunities that can improve the profitability of our company and use our fixed costs infrastructure more effectively.

Clearly, there are more opportunities like that in Europe because of the regional nature of the industry, lots of small regional distributors and there are fewer of those opportunities in the Americas. They exist but they are further and if you were to see, and we have active programs in both geographies to analyze and search out those opportunities and prioritize them to the best of our abilities.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
BMY,Q1,2021,"Thank you. A couple of questions. Based on everything that has been said, it sounds as though the relatlimab data is not competitive with Opdivo plus Yervoy on efficacy. It might be on safety or am I misinterpreting? For instance, you mentioned adding to the armament area but not advancing it.
You referred to many patients on monotherapy are not receiving I-O, but you didn't really refer to those on I-O, I-O. So I'm just curious what we should interpret and what full data be in the abstract on May 19? Second question on slide -- on Page 6. Of the 90% of products in the continuing business, should we think about Opdivo plus Yervoy comprising about 50% of that 90%? Thank you.
","And Steve, the point I would add is, look, we did not do a study of nivolumab plus relatlimab versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab. So it would be unfair to start comparing the data for the two trials. Secondly, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as Chris has said earlier, as Giovanni just said, has been established for a long time, so we have long-term data, overall survival data, response rate data. For relatlimab, we do not have the overall survival data, as well as the response rate data.
But we are excited to see where we stand with our overall progression-free survival data as compared to single-agent nivolumab. And you'll see that data very soon. And certainly, we can have a dialogue after that. But as Giovanni said, very pleased where we are and certainly looking forward to the evolution of the data as we go forward.

","Thank you, Steve. Let me just provide some perspective. So to answer your second question. As we've said, 90% of the business by 2025 being continuing business that excludes Revlimid and Pomalyst.
In that 90%, we've said about a third are the launch brands. The rest is the current online portfolio. We're not breaking that 70% down further into individual products. But I think what's important there is actually the strength of the emerging business for the remainder of the decade.
And obviously, the launch brands become particularly important given that we're discussing 2025. Let me just reiterate our enthusiasm for the relatlimab-Opdivo fixed-dose combination in melanoma. It is clear that we have a very well-established standard of care with O plus Y and long durability of response demonstrated over a long period of time. But I just want to, again, reiterate from an efficacy perspective, from a safety perspective, we are really excited to be able to show the data at ASCO.

Just given where valuation is, how aggressive can you plan to be on the buyback here?","Well we always, I think, look at our business, Will, and you hit it at the end there, on kind of an enterprise EBITDA and we have a, obviously, very solid and strong EBITDA of $136 million or so, I think I said, on a trailing 12-month.

HSY,Q3,2020,"Thank you. And then for a follow-up, you didn't do any share repurchases this quarter, I think that's the first time in two years and that was -- the last time was right before you bought Pirate's Booty. I want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal, of course, but I am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions. I guess particularly, are targets may be more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual or are they more hesitant because they, I guess, kind of want to ride this demand wave as long as they can?","Yeah, I'd be happy to. So first, just on the share repurchase, I will just echo what you said, don't read anything into that. I would say for this year, we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general. Going back to the beginning of the year in the COVID phase, just taken a little bit more cautious approach.
We will be revisiting that as we look at next year and I would say, in general, our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. With respect to M&A specifically, it's probably more the latter, I think people are still, the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre-COVID if not higher.

I mean, we run into the big guys all the time and there’s always smaller players’ involved as well. And so I don’t think with these situations or with COVID, there’s been a big fundamental shift in the competitive landscape.

VNRX,Q1,2021,"Thank you. And then just one more, I would like to ask as it is been around seven months since you have started the beta launch, for Nu.Q Vet, can I talk see if you could talk a bit about, what you have learned so far in the Vet space and how you can take that and kind of apply it to more of the national launch later this year?","Yes, it is actually we have learned a huge amount. I’m really happy and glad that we did it the way we did. I’m very and learning also comes from the people. Dr. Tom Butera coming on board. He is a very well renowned executive in this space, and leaving Mars which is the biggest Vet company in the world and coming to ours, which I’m guessing we are probably one of the smallest really shows his faith in what we are doing. And he has been tremendously helpful in guiding us in some of these issues. But I can put to give some flavor, there is a huge amount of things to learn. Obviously, one very important factor is pricing. Obviously, we want to maximize the revenue. And so we, I think, on the national launch, we will be adjusting the price and you will see all of that, to really maximize the level. Packaging has been very important, the need to be on ice. Obviously, is a big difference in the amount of work required, if it is frozen, or at two degrees. Also, we have learned it is very good to ship a box to the vet, so they don’t have to limit the amount of work they have to do. Also, a lot of that, also just want to package it up and send it off to a centralized lab, there is two big companies or around the world, several big companies, which do that, if you are doing six other tests, it is sometimes users take an extra box. So I think that will be a big part of it. So we have looked at every single aspect, not the test itself, that is worked incredibly well. But just all those nuances are incredibly important to get right. And I think, as I have discussed, but I couldn’t reiterate enough, that what it is also done is proven that we have a product to the big vet companies and small vet companies. And I think we are in a really good position. Because, as far as we are aware, were there any real product out there that can show any real efficacy in cancer in dogs. And there are several big companies and several insurgents in the business, and there is only one of us. So I think puts us in a really good position. And it is I think it is very fair to say that taking this very seriously, we are in very serious discussions. And I think that is going to be a big part of the mix as well. But that is kind of what we wanted to do all along, I think providing a solution ourselves is a good way to move forward and prove it works and get it all fine tuned. But also, and this is true in the human space, but certainly also in the vet space. The companies have hundreds and hundreds of salespeople and reps worldwide. So I think that is going to be hopefully a big part of our mix as well. So all in all, I think it is been a really good process for us. And it should make a deal much smoother if we end up doing one with one of the majors, and also really smooth launch of our product nationally and internationally. Because we also expect to be launching internationally in Europe and Asia, in the coming quarters as well, because there is obviously a big need there as well.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Thank you.","Yeah. Thanks, Simon. First of all, it's important to understand that our $100 million campus target is $100 million. Its small compared to our overall business. We do believe that we can naturally go into our existing customers, who already know EOS and CloudVision.But as I said last year, we were pleasantly surprised by the new prospects and interest in campus. So in a non-COVID environment, I would have expected 60% existing customers and 40% new prospects. In the current environment, I think we're going to go back to a comfort level where our familiar customers are more likely to spend with us.And our new prospects will take time.

WBA,Q4,2019,Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your AllianceRx Walgreens Prime specialty solutions business versus the Shields Health Solutions business? And what is your strategy going forward for bringing in the specialty revenues to the company?,"Sure. Hi Peter, it's Alex here. Yes, I think that they are set at the moment. So, let me deal with our investment in Shields to start with that. They really walk with health systems to enable the health system to take better care of the patients as they go back into community.We have a number of local assets both in hospital systems and also specialty pharmacies where we want to make sure that working with the local health system, we can help them to service and take care of that patient more directly. So it's early days, but that's the model there. Really it's a community model.Our work with AllianceRX is really about the central model in the mean, and of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime which are the Blues and particularly the financial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over two years ago. And the business is now performing from an operational point of view very well, but clearly the market is changing and we're looking forward to how we can of course accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward.So if you think of them as two separate areas at this stage, and of course, we recognize the incredible importance of specialty and the new drugs in the marketplace in the years ahead, I think 50% of the value of medication will be in specialty within three years. So of course, we're working very hard on both the individual piece, I've mentioned, but also how we combine the Walgreens brand and all of our assets over time to create a more powerful specialty model with our -- partners.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Quite a few number of Bristol narrowed its footprint in emerging markets intentionally to focus on I think what it felt was geographies where it had more scale and presence. But with Celgene folded in you're a much bigger organization. And it kind of makes me wonder what the plan is with emerging markets going forward. I don't even see emerging markets or China, mentioned in the press release or in the slide deck. But as we've seen across industry, geographies, like China are very important, especially in their oncology. So it makes me wonder if there's kind of an untapped revenue stream here. And what's the solution, if you think there is indeed a problem that you don't have a big enough footprint now given the size of the company? The second question is on LAG3. If I understand it you have pivotal LAG3 plus Opdivo in combination data coming up around year-end, in first line melanoma as a program that doesn't seem to be get talked about very much investor expectations are low. My question is, should those expectations be low do you view this as a high risk program?","Thank you, Giovanni. I'll take on the last three questions, so, I think, first of all, a lot has happened in terms of drug development part in patients with melanoma and certainly BMS player. BMS has played a big role in getting the FDA together both Opdivo and Yervoy. Lastly as a new mechanism that we are excited about from the early Phase 1 data we have seen, and also from the biomarker data perspective looking at the T-cell exhaustion and how to get the immune system going again. From that perspective, this is going to be a very important study. The trial is currently enrolling and this is certainly seeing from the investigators perspective. They remain excited and they continue to enroll patients in the trial. It is on track. From an enrollment perspective, we continue to collect data we look into where's the readout towards the end of the year.

And then I'll ask Samit to give you his perspective on the ongoing LAG3 program. I think you're point is really important. It is a very good question. You are right that given our focus on oncology and all of the work that we have done over the last few years, we have been focused primarily on, I would say the developed world. I must say we have a meaningful presence in developing countries. And when we've seen when we look at the development of our oncology business in particular, we have had significant success actually outside of the US and Europe and major markets, including Central and Eastern Europe and some of the key markets in Latin America. And as you know recently with the approval of Opdivo in China. So it is also accurate that now we have a broader portfolio and more opportunities to establish a larger presence outside of the tier one top markets. And I'm actually really confident we have the right capabilities there. And we have a strong base to continue to invest internationally. There is a real opportunity, but there is also already a presence of the BMS portfolio that has been successful there.

And are there expectations that you can share with us about the conversions? Thank you.","Yes. I'd repeat something that Arlen said just a minute ago, and that was that we are running programs, of course, that will start the end of this year, but it's really more of a Q1, Q2 phenomenon. The intent there is to convert those licenses to SaaS. And so those would have less of a recognized revenue impact into 2021, but we certainly expect that we'll be able to convert a good portion of those, and that's just based on early conversations, customer usage data, et cetera.

That'd be helpful. Thank you.","Yes, listen, it feels good to be sort of getting back to normal. It isn't totally normal. There are these pockets of disruption. But I would say that surgeons are starting to fill up their schedules, they're taking meetings with us, they're coming to trainings. And so we feel like we're sort of almost getting back to the kind of rhythm we had before, you can see it in our guidance. I mean it is a pretty bullish guide, to say we're going to do 9% to 10%, organic, plus strong performance out of Wright Medical, which was an integration and pretty complex, involving the trauma extremities, as well as our joint replacement business, because those businesses used to be under common sales management, and we've pulled those out.

And so to be able to do all that and have this kind of wind at our back is pretty exciting and I would say customers are ready to engage ALS.

NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to take a bigger question here. Suresh if you had to look back over the past calls, even just four quarters, how much do you think you've forsaken on growth at the expense of keeping the costs down to hit this breakeven for next quarter. How much growth do you think it cost you? And then looking at it another way, with the investment that you are making what do you think the company should be growing at? Because clearly you must have a target in mind in order to invest properly.","Yes. Good question. So, let me go back to the first part of your question, Rich. When I talk about -- I want to underscore one comment, which is the competitive intensity we are seeing and some of the comments I made about large deals taking longer and impacting our pipeline conversion while that’s going on the commercial segment overall our win rates did not change much as a company. In the commercial segment we have a very proven model that generates a very well understood pattern of return and the shift in investment is really what caused us to actually lose some steam on the commercial segment. And so as I go back to the first part of your question, this idea of managing our operating expense envelope within a certain guideline did cause that shift and that's really what cost us our growth because fundamentally our investment in commercial are still bearing fruit with the same pattern and we know that making those investments will get that growth back for us. That is not a place where we are seeing all of the competitive intensity that I've been describing. So that’s the first comment I would make. That's also what's guiding our next steps which is making the investments back in commercial will return us to growth, it will take a couple of quarters for those investments to take to bear fruit, but second half of next year we do expect to reaccelerate growth. Now, in terms of a specific target for growth for a specific long-term number, I'm not going to give you more specific than that which other than to say we always offer it with certain growth aspirations, which shows this quarter because of the investment correcting that we believe will return us back to being able to have those same aspirations.",1.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Was that a unit or a pricing increase?","Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this 7% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the basket size.

TTE,Q4,2021,"Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, gentlemen. Patrick, you mentioned about Suriname that you may be able to identify the oil development by the end of the year. So what exactly we have to do in order for us to reach that space? How far we are from reaching that kind of decision? And the second point is that on -- second question, on the LNG sales mix that the page in your presentation, it looked like about 40%, 45% of the sales is in spot. So we assume that volume is totally linked to the spot LNG price or that they are still, to a large part, linked to the long-term oil prices.","So Suriname is just drilling. We need to appraise. We have several discoveries. We have a plan. I think we have 1, 2, 3 wells to drill in order to confirm. I mean, we have 3 -- next 3 wells on the self-run pole where we have many different discoveries. I think with the 3 wells we will comfort us capacity to -- again, you know the point is that we are targeting enough oil pool to avoid -- to have -- to find a solution for commercialization of the gas which might be tricky and delay everything. So there are 3 wells for me coming and we intend to drill them, all of them by '22. So I think it's why I was answering end of '22 I hope we'll have high things plan. And I would say, the self-run pole because then we explore on the north as well of the block. But where we have made discoveries mainly on the southern part of the block. For me, after these 3 wells, we have a clarity of what can be done and the size of it engaging towards development. So that's the point where I am today. If I had to explain you all details, it could take 2 hours because there are plenty of cases, assumptions, etcetera. So we need to drill. Second and we find hydrocarbon [indiscernible] don't worry. But the question is of which oil, of which gas, etcetera.

So on the other part, yes, you are right. It's a 60% long-term and 40% spot. Spot is pure spot. I mean spot is 2 things, in fact. In the spot volume, you have 10 million tons, let's say, as a round figure which is 20% is old deals [ph] which are spot deals which means we have the vessels, we have the LNG tankers and we buy spot and we sell spot and we make small money on the difference between buying arbitrating. But it's a pure spot. And then in our portfolio of the marketing team, there are contracts which are linked to spot indicator, I would say, either JKM or NBP. And these ones are not oil linked. If they oil linked, they are more in the long-term part. I'm speaking under the eyes of Stephane. If I made a mistake, you raise your -- it's okay? It's okay. So the answer is right. That's my answer.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

I wanted to ask if you could talk about how much scale the current supply chain, the distribution centers, infrastructure you have, how much they can handle and when do you expect as we think out over time, the next kind of major round of investments in IT and supply chain?","Sure. So in terms of major processing facilities, major distribution centers, just as a reminder, we added a new distribution center last year, that was in 2015 and we had added one before that in 2014, so some pretty lumpy investments that we have now worked our way through. Given our current growth projections, we would expect that we would need additional major distribution capacity, probably, in about four years or five years from now.

With regards to robotics, I mean, we've talked about this before is of our key areas of focus for robotics and applications that are next.

BMY,Q1,2021,"Thank you. I have a kind of a higher-level question on the PD-1 space. Can you just talk about your longer-term view on whether price competition in this category is kind of imminent or eventually will happen in developed markets, both U.S. and Europe? The space is clearly getting more crowded, both domestically produced PD-1s, as well as those sourced from Chinese biopharma companies.
And while price competition usually is not a winning strategy, it might be the only lever a lots of these other companies can pull, and I think at least in China as many have started to recognize the PD-1 category has become a commoditized class. So lots of folks are trying to figure out what precludes us from happening outside of China. Can you articulate your views here?
","Yes. Thanks for the question, Tim. We, obviously, think about this quite a bit. As we think about the number of new PD-1 entrants in the market, we really look at it on two dimensions.
First, there's the competitive impact of having additional players on the market. Frankly, that's an area that we pay attention to, but we're a little bit less concerned about. We have considerable resources focused on planning around competition. We have a good track record of competing in these markets.
And while we are always a bit paranoid of potential new entrants, we feel very good about our ability to effectively manage competition. The second dimension that we look at is the one you're raising, which is the risk of commoditization of a market. And the way we look at that is commoditization, we think, requires two things: it requires a low-cost entrants, and it requires perceived interchangeability on the part of payers, providers and patients. The risk of both of these things coming together likely varies, we believe, by geography, healthcare system.
It may be even by therapeutic setting, but we pay very close attention to this. In terms of the risk, we absolutely believe it's something that we need to stay on top of. It's, as you note, very dynamic. Currently, the areas where we see the greatest risk don't overlap with our largest markets, at least today.
But we certainly have plans to address the risk as they become more tangible. The two things that I think we can continue to do that position us well against this threat are, first, continue to leverage the extremely broad data set that we have generated in I-O to ensure that treatment decisions continue to be clinically driven. And then, second, continue to rapidly bring new data and approvals to market, such that we're constantly pushing forward innovation and changing the standard of care. But this is an area that's very dynamic, and we're paying close attention to it.

NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thank you. I just had a follow-up here on pricing and then one another follow-up as well. Historically Suresh, pricing has always been aggressive. And in the past your technology advantage has kind of more than offset some of the pricing pressure that you have seen. So first question, why is aggressive pricing now starting to impact you more so than it has in the past?","Yeah, I think, Brent, pricing has always been a factor and I’ve said this on the last two calls, pricing has been getting more and more intense. You can see in our results this quarter that pricing actually impacted our gross margin to some degree as well. So we still maintain a very substantial advantage. But as we are getting into larger and larger deals and those are accounting for greater share of our overall business, typically pricing tends to elongate sales cycle as large enterprise, so that's affecting our conversion rate. Often, I’ve also said before this, Brent, typically, incumbents get the last word on pricing and often it ends up becoming one where the customer says let me stay with the incumbent. So that's another factor we're starting to see.

And can you just talk about what’s really driving the higher discounting activity in the third quarter and it sounds like you talked about the fourth quarter trends being a bit of a moderation from a discounting activity perspective. So if you could just go through that in more details I’d appreciate it.","OK, Judy, let’s start with one-time versus ongoing. The numbers that we’ve quoted are all our ongoing business. We’ve eliminated the one-time. So then if you focus in on the various markets, I’d say in the short term there have been price increases in both Quebec, Ontario and Alberta as well, earlier in September. That will begin - we’re seeing in Ontario not just the price increase of the premium brands, but we have seen over the last six weeks movement up on the products that are the value brands, which is encouraging. And that continues today. So we’re very encouraged by that. I’d say Quebec - although pricing has been taken certainly to date in this quarter - it remains pretty competitive in that market, and if you go back in time this is really - it happens from time to time in our market place where certain markets get overheated and it usually works its way through in a period of time, but this summer was, starting in the second quarter but really into the summer was a particularly aggressive time amongst all competitors in the marketplace.",2.0,0.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0

And what level of granularity should we expect around the data set of ASCO as it relates to LAG-3 positivity, etc.? And then, Giovanni, a different twist perhaps on the business question. When you took over a CEO, I imagine there was quite a sense of urgency to diversify the company. But with the steps you've already taken to do so, would it be fair to characterize your M&A strategy from here as more about enhancing existing franchises and less about diversification as a concept? Thanks.","Thank you, Greg. Let me start there, and then, I'll ask Samit to give you an answer on the biomarker strategy for LAG-3. I think you're absolutely right. I believe that one of the things that is a clear strength for the company today is the diversification of our business.
When you look at our oncology business, solid tumors and hematology, what's happening in immunology, which is clearly the fastest-growing segment of our business right now and the long-term sustainable leadership position that we have in cardiovascular medicine, I think that we have an incredibly well-diversified set of businesses with strong dynamics for all four of them. So I think that's an important foundation that we've built for the company. And at this point, I see that as an opportunity because we have capabilities that we can leverage. We clearly have deep expertise, whether that's from a scientific and development perspective or from a commercial perspective, growing in all of those areas.
And it gives us an opportunity to look at assets where we can acquire really promising technology, apply our expertise and maximize the value of those assets. So the priority for us now in business development is across all of those areas, to continue to strengthen our portfolio. And as I've mentioned several times, the objective that we have is to further strengthen the outlook in the second part of the decade. But our business is extremely well diversified at this point.

TTE,Q4,2021,"Thank you. Patrick, can you talk about unit development costs in the Upstream and I mean both across oil and gas. If I remember rightly, you used to talk about a figure of about 50,000 barrels per day on unit development costs. And I just wonder if you could update that figure for the current cost and environmental portfolio. And what I'm getting at here is that the Upstream CapEx that you're guiding to in 2022 is well below where it was in '19. So I'm just trying to understand how much of that has changed in emphasis versus lower cost versus any assumptions on disposals that you're making in 2022. And then the second question which is a point of a clarification on your reserve replacement ratio because 121% was sitting on the slide labeled oil. I wasn't sure whether that was just for the oil part of the business or that was across the entire Upstream?","You need to listen. The second answer is -- it's in the slide oil but it's oil and gas, it's a global one. We didn't know where to put it. We put it there yesterday evening because we got the figure quite late. So there was not a perfect position. We could have done it elsewhere. So it's oil and gas. So reverse replacement rate global one 121% on 1 year and 116% on 3 years. So the second answer is this is the first 1. Yes, it's true but we report in net investments and that clearly, there are some sales on the E&P side embedded in the budget. So the organic part of the CapEx for E&P is higher than the $7 billion, you could -- or $6, billion, $7 billion -- I think it's $8 billion, more or less. And but you fully have an assumption of around $2 billion of sales, more or less. It's more as the metrics but I think if I remember well, what we have.

Obviously, the $50,000 per barrel per day of flowing barrel is a metric where today, we don't see any inflation in the projects at this stage, a little inflation. We've seen some inflation on steel, I would say, in the Uganda project. I think we -- in the last -- the delay in the last year costed us a little -- some extra but we are managing that, I think, some flexible contracts. So at this stage, the $50,000 per barrel flowing barrel because we are targeting some low-cost barrel, I would say, is -- you can still consider it.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

One was the oral presentation for RX. So that was very exciting data and very timely too in this era as we try to think about conserving healthcare resources. So what data showed on 195 patients is two things. One, it showed that for the high risk patients, recurrence happens rather quickly. So 70% of high risk patients have a recurrence within two years which speaks to again the previous comment that we can’t ignore these patients and they need to be managed rather quickly once they are found to be high risk. The other thing that that poster showed was that low risk people tend to get intensively followed in terms of bringing them back for frequent CT surveillance. And actually only 4% of those low risk patients recurred. So the case was made on that poster that perhaps we don’t need to follow these patients as intensively as we do and in fact we could switch them to annual CT surveillance which would relieve a lot of patient anxieties at the same time conserving precious healthcare resources.

My question is all physicians going to come after that presentation and rethink that strategy for first line non-small cell lung on the back of that data, is there enough follow-up there? Second, in terms of the 9ER trial, could you talk to cover that too? I remember that when you ran the Phase 2, there was a question about toxicity and making sure and be use the low dose. So given it's a much more promiscuous TTI, should we assume a favorable or comparable tops profile? Anything you could share that would be interesting.

What I would say from a commercial standpoint is obviously we've had a lot of discussions with physicians over the last few months about 227 and 9LA. And it's important what Samit said that physicians and we really do think that 227 and 9LA really need to be thought about together. 227, you'll recall that what we showed was about 50% of responders were still responding at two years, and we saw this nice flattening of the OS curve. You'll see how that data matures at ASCO into few weeks. But then the way physicians are thinking about 9LA is very much as complimentary to 227. In that they offer the benefit of Opdivo plus Yervoy to patients who don't need chemotherapy, that's 227. And for those patients who potentially do need chemotherapy and that's where 9LA comes into play. And I think Samit hit on some of the key things that you want to pay attention to when that data are presented at ASCO in a few weeks. Two other things that I would just keep in mind with respect to Opdivo plus Yervoy in lung. First about half of the lung cancer treaters have used Opdivo plus Yervoy either in melanoma or renal. So, they're familiar with the benefit that we see with that regimen there and those physicians account for about two thirds of total lung cancer patients. And then the second thing not a trivial thing is that we have a very experienced team with a track record of being able to establish Opdivo plus Yervoy at a standard of care in both of the tumors in which we've been approved with that regimen. And then they're incredibly excited and prepared to launch Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer and we're really looking forward to the PDUFA date for 227 next week.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Is that a function of resource allocation or is it a function of what you're seeing with this particular molecule? Thank you.","Thank you, Andrew, as always very thoughtful questions. And certainly a thought provoking from our 9LA perspective certainly we're looking forward to the first presentation of the data. At ASCO, virtually, but certainly going to be very meaningful. As you recall we had finished enrollment towards the beginning of last year. So at the first readout of the data, the interim analysis, the follow-up is short. What we will be able to share is follow on data from that perspective. It's very important I think to realize from 9LA perspective a few things that are questions that we will be looking towards the data to answer. One is as we continue to follow on and as you continue the follow up, what happens to that OS curve? Does it start to flatten out? Number one. Number two, what happens to that beginning part of the curve that we saw in CheckMate227 where we have the early progresses and how a limited amount of chemotherapy can impact that? I think those are the very important answers that we be looking for as you look towards the presentation of the 9LA data. We remain excited. I think both of them have to be considered together with 227 data and the 9LA data in overall management of a patient as you look towards non-small cell lung cancer management as we go forward. So I think that dual IO inhibition becomes very important along with that shortened duration of chemotherapy for some patients required. I will obviously ask towards the end of when I finished that to Chris also to comment from commercial perspective was that really need. On the 9ER side, as you mentioned, a couple of medics will use a dose of 40 milligrams and certainly that is going to be important in terms of management of the safety profile. As we've already said, that overall what we have seen is generally quite manageable safety profile. Chris also spoke about, that this provides an opportunity for further use of Opdivo in all the risk categories in combination with this potential. So certainly very exciting news there the trial has met all three endpoints, the major endpoints if you look at from an overall survival benefit, as well as looking at DFS and response rate, in addition to a very well managed safety profile. And I'll finish off on the TIGIT and then I'll pass it on to Chris to comment further on both9LA as well as 9ER. On the TIGIT perspective, we are looking forward to see the data that Roche will be presenting, certainly a very complex mechanism, as you very well know. We have our molecule which is in Phase 1. We continue to evaluate the Phase 2. And the overall dose profile for that agent and certainly there's no data to be shared yet, but we will certainly learn from what Roche is going to present and then we'll see if we can manage differently.

BMY,Q1,2020,"Thank you. So questions for Samit please. In terms of attending 9LA data at ASCO, what is the follow up of that data for both OSN for PFS? My question is all physicians going to come after that presentation and rethink that strategy for first line non-small cell lung on the back of that data, is there enough follow-up there? Second, in terms of the 9ER trial, could you talk to cover that too? I remember that when you ran the Phase 2, there was a question about toxicity and making sure and be use the low dose. So given it's a much more promiscuous TTI, should we assume a favorable or comparable tops profile? Anything you could share that would be interesting. And then finally on TIGIT, Roche's pushing forward very aggressively with that TIGIT antagonist. Merck clearly is interested and active with as your program seems not to been very much. Is that a function of resource allocation or is it a function of what you're seeing with this particular molecule? Thank you.","Thank you, Andrew.

Just -- you may have mentioned this earlier but I was just curious in terms of the regional disparities that you might have in terms of the newspapers, you’ve made mention in the past about some of your most difficult markets, so I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in those difficult markets. Are you seeing in terms of company wide trends, are they in line, are they below? Could you just give us a little bit more color there?","You know, on the regional trends, things have I think evened out a bit but we continue to see, for instance, in a Florida where we have Fort Meyers where there was a huge amount of speculation in secondary, third, fourth homes and folks were speculating, we continue to see obviously tremendous pressures there. Conversely in Bravard, Florida, which is not too too far from Fort Meyers on the other coast, we are actually seeing things, trends abate a little bit in that market. In Phoenix, things are continuing to struggle a bit on the real estate side but I think they’ve done a good job of recasting their structure. So we continue to see in the real estate side the California, Florida, Arizona, Nevada being very difficult but in those other categories, it really is very much a community by community difference",2.0,2.0,1,0.0,0.0,2.0

I'm just curious, what was the decline in these metrics during the month of April? Thank you.","And just on the question around the stocking that we saw. So as we entered the pandemic situation in February and March, what we saw was across the board, we saw safety stocks increasing so we saw wholesalers, making sure they had increased inventory. We also saw that pharmacies had extra safety stock. And then we installed with patients getting longer scripts, as we talked about it. Revlimid was an example doubling the number of days that they could get. We are starting to see some of that destocking come out. And we anticipate, as I said earlier that the majority of that will come out in Q2. So of the $500 million that we talked about, majority of that come out in Q2, and then we'll see it coming out to in Q3 remainder is what we're anticipating. As far as what we're seeing on the new patient started early days. What we're seeing there, but we did see some of those new Rxs declining 10% to 20%, depending upon them. And we'll be watching that very closely in the second quarter, and we'll update you on that. And then on the infusion center, similar, that we're seeing in that 10% to 20% range as well, fewer patients.

So in the CV space, it's been sort of on the order of 20% to 25% across the NOAC class. A lesser extent in oncology and the tumors that we are in, it's been on the order of 5% to 20%. And as David mentioned, that has led to some choppiness, for example, in Opdivo sales in April, which we think is attributable to the new patients, to the drop in new patient starts. That said, we would expect that as David had mentioned, that would the biggest impact for that would be in the second quarter that would begin to normalize and be back to more normal levels by the third quarter - by the fourth quarter, and that's what we'll be continuing to monitor.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

During the review process, there may be many more questions that come to us. But that's a very normal process. So I think that's the way to look at it.

VNRX,Q1,2021,"Thanks Cam. That was perfect. I threw a lot at you. But you did a great job answering. Thanks again. And I just want to take the Nu.Q Capture great publication with mass spec data, but when you think about like commercialization looks like a product could be out by 2022, which is positive. But, when you when you think about, like submitting for regulatory approval, how quickly could that FDA or see more kind of occurred? And if it is going down the pathway, would that be a PMA IBD, because it is a screening test, it seems. And then I’m also wondering, like longer term, would partnerships with companies that are offered that instrumentation like mass spec or next gen sequencers. Would those partnerships makes sense to kind of couple the assets with?","Yes, absolutely. So we are obviously not in the sequencing nor mass spectrometry space. So I think the Nu.Q capture from and thank you, yes, the paper was fantastic. Nice, great to be in nature scientific reports, it was a real breakthrough shows that it is reproducible and robust to like the rest of our platform. So commercialization, of course anything which is going to be next year would not be an FDA study, it would be sold as a service for others to help them I think there is a lot of different ways by capturing and concentrating the crumbs and fragments, we can help a range of different groups. And I will my team can go through that with greater detail. But anything which is sorry, obviously, selection of monitoring as part of a trial would take many years. That is certainly not going to be next year. But I think given what we are doing, like with Nu.Q discovery, it is looking very good in a range of different areas for capture, and it would be selling and as a service. And would we work with big companies? Absolutely. So I guess there is one very well known, big sequencing company, and there is quite a few big companies in the liquid biopsy space. And I think, like everything, we would look to launch our own products to show it works to really get the ball rolling, like we have invested. But we are very, very interested in licensing, particularly in capture, because it would be something we believe if it all works well could be incredibly useful to them. So it is not something we have to commercialize ourselves. So I think once we have got the very good proof of concept from the next level, if that happens, we would quite aggressively look to license it out.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

So as you’ve mentioned, we are shifting dollars into the back half for promotional and marketing support. Those dollars are being generated from ongoing transformation initiatives, as well as the benefits that Mary mentioned in our cost structure savings initiatives, and those dollars that we are planning to invest will be spent on promotional events during Thanksgiving week, through Cyber Monday, as well as driving enrollment in BEYOND+ and investing in new communication channels such as digital video and radio.In terms of quantifying it, we’ve built it all into the model and that the reinvestment of those dollars is allowing us to maintain our top line at around $11.4 billion, as well as maintain our bottom line within the previously guided range.",2.0,2.0,0,1.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, there’s been a sharp increase in the profitability of many of the players in the home furnishings industry. So do you think that the sector is now just structurally earning higher margin? And how does varying form how to think about our itches profitability in the second half of the year where when you talk about the two or two half and the second half that you will be facing some unique factors and much more difficult comparisons?","Sure. Yes. Good question. I think to answer that question you really got to look at what's the revenue growth that the businesses experienced in 2020, right? And that's why I made the point and I kind of repeated the point in the letter that we hit 21.8% operating margin on 8% revenue growth, right? So we had 750 basis points of margin expansion on 8% revenue growth. So that's the first part of it, right? So you can kind of book that, right? That's not going away because that's got nothing to do with the pandemic. That's got nothing to do with home furnishings tailwinds, 8% revenue growth nothing to do with that. So that's all structural and we would have - by the way it's about what we thought we were going to earn before the pandemic, okay? Our model was about 22% what we thought we'd make and then the pandemic hit. And with the pandemic hit, I mean, what it did is he just turned it into two halves. Now did we optimize a little bit here and there? We did but our plan was to have revenue growth slightly higher. So - but what we came out right about there. So if you've got people that have grown faster in 2020 than they had historically, there - you got to kind of say how much of that sticks? How much of the leverage sticks? And then there's a really important one to kind of figure out where everybody's going to land here is what - what the price structure and the promotional structure of the business, right? So we didn't get less promotional. We are - we don't have promotions, right? The only thing we have is we have things that we're discontinuing out of the assortment but we're not a promotional business, right? So there's businesses - if you study our industry, there's businesses that have - they've pulled back on promotions as they should, right. And they pull back on promotions and we're able to have X amount of demand or revenues. When the world cycles at some point, can they maintain a non-promotional stance? Because I'm sure people have picked up 200 basis points, maybe 300 basis points of a product margins because they used to be really promotional and now they don't have to be promotional because there is this increased demand. That's - to me that's the open switch. How much of the revenue sticks? So what happened to their margin in our industry is tied to an increased revenues which ours is not, because our revenues didn't shift. So you - again, if we - if you would have saw the $150 million of revenues hit in this year and we would have been at 23% operating margin, 120 basis points of our model, we would have pointed that to you. We would have said, it’s kind of in our view one time and maybe not structural. But there's nothing about our revenues in 2020 that are pandemic-assisted. There's nothing about our product margin that is pandemic-assisted. We were not less promotional than we planned to be, that we have - if we have a membership model. So the margin growth you saw on our product is real margin growth. It's not necessarily temporal at all so that's what I'd say or if you said. And then the other piece, the other one I'd point to is advertising, right? So if you're looking, particularly if you're looking at somebody like Wayfair and I'm not picking at Wayfair. I think honestly, if first I thought Wayfair was not going to make it. And I thought like when I studied their S-1, when they’re filing where I thought like yes, this doesn't look like a real thing but I've grown to appreciate and respect the platform Wayfair is built and their ability to generate a lot of revenue very quickly. The question in my mind with Wayfair is what's the real structural margin in the company? And so with someone like Wayfair, I think it's - you’re snow blind right now, right? There - it's like if you think about every restaurant in America and most of the world closed. So anybody selling kitchen stuff, the run on kitchen like if you go buy toasters and pots and pans and other things like that because now you're not eating out, even people like my household because my girls are way in college now. I mean, I eat out every night, like we eat out every night My partner and I and she went out and did like a raid on the kids like we’ve got a whole brand new kitchen, right? Because we are going to be home like so we've got all kinds of new stuff. She's cooking stuff, she's never cooked before. And so I look at kind of categories like that and I go, those may not be sustainable and also those are the things where she was going to buy it whether it was on sale or not, right? She was going to buy the cookware whether it's on sale or not. And it says if the promotional aspects of some of these businesses, some of these categories is very, very different, right? Like when the pandemic first happened, I was analyzing everything and is going on everybody’s website, I think I joked around, I said Wayfair has 60 pages of toasters and they do. It might be more now, it's 60 pages of toasters, I think 40 or 60 pages are sold out. So you have a run on businesses like that. But - so when I think about the industry and I think about where we sit in the industry, I try to understand the differences of what revenue was a gift. Like we have a lot of demand that was a gift, no revenue that was a gift, right? We didn't ship any of it. So we have 8% growth and the 750 basis points, oh, and then the other one is advertising, excuse me. As you think about advertising leverage someone like Wayfair got or other business - any - every business, right? We all got some advertising leverage like we missed a catalog cycle, right? The source book cycle last year. So call that, I don't know, $40 million, something like that, right, or $60 million. So you say, hey, Gary. Can you guys sustain this? You’ve got to put that advertising back into the model. And that’s a good question. I’m not sure yet. I’m not sure. But that’s something that, like, we think about. Like, do we need to go back to mailing a book twice a year? Do - can we mail less books? Our big galleries and our investments in restaurants is driving more traffic. And what do we need there? But I'd say those - the revenue, the promotional structure and margin structure based on promotions, and then the advertising piece of it. And then, of course, if people got a big lift that - they're going to get occupancy leverage and some things like that that might come back. So I don't know how sustainable - if I look across our industry, the margin structure is as of today, I - everybody wants you to believe it is. That's why I made the point - and I was like - I'm kind of really happy. We only had 8% revenue growth because - nobody can be snow-blind here including us, right? So I like - like, hey, do we have roughly 22% operating margin business today? Without a pandemic, that's what we got. And how much pandemic boost are we going to have in 2021? If our revenues are up 15%, maybe a little, right, because we’re going to start growing internationally. And then when we start growing globally, we're going to open countries. We're going to open in Europe and be able to take online orders and ship to all of Europe. So it's not like we're opening and - in a market like Sacramento or we're opening a new store in Vancouver, Montreal or something. And we're opening in a huge country, I mean, in Europe should be the size for us, the closest size of the United States in volume, right. So that's big. Like it’d be like that’s coming to America with a brand that people know. Like I saw some - some analysts, I don’t know if they’re on the phone or not, like they tend to write kind of negative things about us all the time. So they knew who they are. But, like anything they could say, they’ll talk like oh, their business is down and their New York restaurant. Like, oh, that's - I mean, they're not going to make their fourth quarters, like give me a break. But after - but anyway, the - they're - in one of their notes they said like, yes, we have no - we have no market awareness. Like - like people don't know us. Like, don't look at some average market awareness study. Our customer is the top 1%. In many cases is that they are - the core of our business is the top half of 1%. Do that brand awareness. Go into London, go into Paris, and go talk to the top 1% who all dressed in the same labels. They all have Rolex watches and other things. They all go to the same restaurants. They go on while on vacation DeSanto Bay, Aveza, St. Barts, Aspen. They all know each other and they all know us. So, like you want to know about brand awareness and why we're confident. Okay, because the people that buy the other great luxury brands, they know about us. We’re the only high-end brand of our kind in the world. Everybody else is just a category player. They do self-sofas or they sell lighting. We’re the only one of our kind. And so the opportunity for us when you think about growth long-term is when we start opening countries like - that’s like coming to America and being relatively well-known at the market segment that you’re targeting and opening a gallery in New York and opening a gallery in L.A. something that like maybe compare that to Paris and London, right? And go in like and then open whole Internet to the whole market and you go like you don't think about it as stores. You don't think about it as markets. You think about what could the United States generate if I had a store in New York and L.A. - amazing stores in New York and L.A. and they knew my brand and all the sudden they have a website and I've been wanting to shop from them for years. And I've had to fly to America, buy stuff find, a container shipping company and ship it myself. Like I think there could be a run on the house here when we go international. Like I think it's going to be better than any anybody else's model who stepped across the pond.

ANET,Q1,2020,"Thanks a lot for taking the question. Kind of a different way of maybe asking the same question again. But I'm curious of how you think about the demand profile from the cloud guys. We're seeing industry reports talking about pretty healthy server demand at several of these public cloud vendors.We've seen the numbers from Microsoft and others. And what kind of the lag effect you see between server footprint deployments or expansion versus actually pulling more network bandwidth means and obviously, a benefit for Arista?","First of all, we do see cloud titan use case demand in basically three areas. Either our customers are adding additional core or spine capability or they're expanding racks to increase their server density or in some cases, we're also seeing some geo expansion for their international needs. Although some of them have been ordered from the United States, increasing our U.S. titans contribution.So I think the use cases for us is very, very clear. What we also see is that because we have long lead times that Anshul and the team are working very closely on really understanding and sharpening their forecast and timing and working with us on scenarios and contingencies.So I think when they are starting to look at their 2020 deployments, they're not just looking at Q1, Q2, they try to give us visibility for the second half as well. And so while we have not factored any of that into our Q1 or Q2 forecast, we are seeing them doing some very prudent planning and for business continuity in their 2020 time frame.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And what kind of the lag effect you see between server footprint deployments or expansion versus actually pulling more network bandwidth means and obviously, a benefit for Arista?","No, absolutely. I know there's been a lot of commentary about other components that go into the cloud where there's compute, other pieces and so on. And it's hard to correlate one-for-one, especially in this time frame because some of the spike in those other components is coming because of shortages in previous quarters if you remember that.So as a result of that there might be some volatility and you will see some spike up on computers on. Networking has been stable. As Jayshree mentioned, we saw constraints towards the end of Q1 but prior to that things was stable. They were not short on networking gear and so on.I do wonder I had one last comment on the traffic needs. And there’s a lot of commentary on the street and how traffic is growing and spiking up and work-from-home and so on. We have to keep those trends in mind relative to the overall cloud capacity.And yes, working from home, means may need videoconferencing or phone calls or edge connectivity. But that's a very small fraction of the overall cloud spend in the broader markets.So yes, sometimes traffic quadrupled or grow 7x in certain regions. But that's less than a 1% impact to the overall spend. So I would say there's some hyper on that rather than material impact to us. But as mentioned, things in the cloud are stable.

ENTR,Q4,2009,"Thanks a lot. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple of questions here. In terms of the – assuming that Verizon starts coming back as you'd previously answered in the question, what type of revenue base do you think we should be at the end of the year in terms of breakdown in telco, cable and satellite? Is cable going to be bigger than the telco side, or is the telco going to be bigger than the cable by the end of next year?","Yes. I know it's – we really don't kind of break things down like that and we really don't want to provide guidance beyond the current quarter. I would say generally, if you look historically when Verizon was our only deployment of MoCA, they represented north of 70% of the overall revenue of the company. As we kind of moved into this Q4 period, they lost than half of that in terms of our overall revenue. And I think even with the spring back in Verizon, the other businesses are going to be growing at a more rapid clip. So the Verizon component of our overall business is maybe a third of our business and decreasing from there. I think the satellite opportunity and the cable opportunity each are as big as the Verizon deployment over time. So, we should see pretty uniform distribution and diversification of our revenue across the MoCA business, while at the same time, we are also seeing pretty substantial growth in our non-MoCA produce lines as well. So I think generally, we are going to see continued diversification of the revenue stream across multiple service providers and multiple products.",2.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess just following on that question, Anup, it's you from I guess replying backward pricing or competitive pressure on your own side because your gross margins are ahead of your own locking target. Do you now see there is enough price velocity I guess in this marketplace for you to lower margin and potentially take more share and hit those targets you've had in the past?","Yeah. Amit, this is a good question. I think we have answered -- address this before as well and I will say this on any given deal typically we don't walk away because there is a point at which we are not willing to match our competitor on price. In larger deals what we tend to see sort of happening as a result of price is two things. One, the customer evaluation cycle gets longer and so often deals that we've noticed a greater than 10% elongation in our sales cycle, as customer spend more time sort of going back and forth if you will on the decision-making and that's one factor. The second factor is in many instances the last word the long's to the incumbent. In many instances when EMC or NetApp's say they are willing to go all the way down in price to hold off any single project that tends to be the barrier. What we have also noticed is every one of those instances is one where we go back on the next project or the project after that to the same customer.

AMD,Q4,2019,"Thanks a lot. I guess I had another question, just [Audio gap] gross margin [Audio gap] of the year's revenue in semi-custom would be in the back half. But how does that break out between September and December? I guess, I asked that because I'm just, you know, trying to see what the gross margin will be exiting this year if you strip out semi-custom. Could it be 50% exiting the year? Thanks.","I think, you know, it's hard to break it down that way. We are in the initial stages of planning for the ramp, and you're asking about Q3, Q4. We are projecting about 80% of the semi-custom revenue, growing double digits year over year in Q3 and Q4. And typically, when we have this new game launches, our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi-custom will be Q3.
But Q4, when you talk about the ramp of the product, especially in the first year of the ramp, it's hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact would be exiting 2020 from a gross margin, excluding semi-custom. Maybe as we get closer to that and talking about three to six months, we can probably give you a better idea of that.

TAP,Q3,2008,"Thanks again. Question about the JV Mechanics. If I’m reading the numbers from the press release correctly, the amount of cash that was funneled back up to you at TAP was about $59 million versus equity income of $106.5 million. Is there anything unusual about this particular period, any reason we shouldn’t be thinking that from quarter to quarter at least typically you’re going to be getting all the cash flow back to you? I guess part of the answer has to do with CapEx that occurs there at the JV. But how are you thinking about the relationship between what you get back and what the JV actually generates?","Thanks for that question, Mark. It’s a complicated question only because obviously the JV is going through a period of trying to drive those synergies. We’re been pretty clear that to achieve the $500 million in synergies they’re going to have to spend about $450 million. That doesn’t come in any sort of erasable way. I can tell you from a shareholder, as a shareholder of the JV, we are in a place where we are looking to get the cash from our joint venture as rapidly as possible. We do have a process that we go through each month, which looks to minimize any cash that’s actually held at the JV. So to the extent that we don’t get cash it’s because we’re putting the cash to good use in the joint venture itself to drive those synergies.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
CTXS,Q3,2020,"Thanks and congrats from me as well. I want to ask a slightly more bigger picture question again. David, if I look at how customers can solve this new working environment of being -- having to be a lot more flexible in terms of what they offer their employees in terms of where to work and how to work, et cetera, like, can you just remind us, like, what would be the solutions that are available there? To me, that seems like just Citrix and one more competitor, but like maybe I'm missing something. Just kind of remind us on how this can be achieved. And then where are customers on that journey towards that? Thank you.
","Sure, Raimo. I think it's a bigger picture question that's worth talking about just from that. I mean when we entered this pandemic period, there was a large narrative in the marketplace about how long it was going to last. And I think that those had anticipated the lockdown being two, three, four weeks at a time employed a number of different solutions to just allow people to connect remotely, simple VPN probably being the most obvious one. As it persisted over a period of time, two things happened. One is that a lot of companies stepped back, and they realized that a VPN, for example, is just not a great solution. It's not a great security picture, and it's not a great user experience from a performance point of view. And so many of those have stepped back and thought about what do we need to do longer term. The other thing that's been really interesting is just that the view that remote working is actually way more productive than people anticipated. And so now you see all these different studies, including those by our Citrix research arm, that will point to two-thirds or three-quarters of companies that are planning on adopting a more flexible model for a few reasons; one, it's better for individuals, drives higher engagement, higher productivity, it's better for companies because they can reduce real estate footprint, reduce absenteeism and all these great attributes we've talked a lot about. And so this idea that it's not about working either in a physical office or at-home, it's just about enabling productivity where were people happen to be. And the one common denominator there to make sure that that experience from a user standpoint is secure, it's managed, it's available and it's consistent, is a digital workspace. And so a lot of the pivot that we're driving in our conversations, our positioning, of course, is really removing this idea that it's either work-from-home or work in the office. But really, it's about working anywhere. And that's why we really believe that the digital workspace type technologies have a really strategic importance going forward. And that’s one of the reasons why you've seen the growth rate of that business tick up as strongly as it has throughout Q1, Q2 and Q3 of this year and what we believe to be a nice tailwind going forward. We have to keep driving that idea forward to make sure that it's not just about virtualization, for example, but really creating that holistic workspace platform that allows us to deliver applications in a virtual way directly or actually made it mobile. And that's the benefit of what we've been building.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TECD,Q4,2008,"Thanks and good morning. On the gross margin, I know it’s difficult, but can you ballpark what gross margin would have been excluding the currency benefits you got in the quarter. It would seem like they were squarely above 5% even excluding the currency benefit, and if that’s true, it would be the first time I think since 2005 where that’s the case. So can you confirm that and more importantly rank the key factors that helped gross margin performance. You threw a lot of variables out there but how much of it or I guess, in the order of priority it was customer mix, pricing, freight, vendor incentives and any other variable, you think were important?","Brian, this is Bob. If I think about the quarter, the thing that I like the best about it was our ability to execute in really kind of uncharted waters, that the teams had not been faced with the degree and severity of the FX buffeting that we got in Q3 and then their ability to map out a plan and recover much of that FX opportunity in the quarter, really speaks to our ability to set our sights on a goal and execute. And to do all of that in a slippery economic environment as well, really speaks to the quality of the management team on the ground and their ability to execute with our vendors and our customers. So, to kind of prioritize and size the elements of the gross margin improvement, it’s a good exercise but really the exercise is our ability to execute in a tough environment and do it very well.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

We really can't tell you precisely what that gross margin would have been without, because we have to estimate it all, because, of course, we don't know where the market is.

I think if you took the far extreme, you could take the two quarters, combine it Q3 and Q4, and net out the FX loss for the six months and if you see that you will see that the net gross margin would have been just under 5% for the second half of the year, and that would have been a slight improvement 8, 9, 10 basis points above the prior year calculation.

So, clearly we didn’t recover our 100% of the FX loss because some of its cost and the expenses, because the cost differential in the forward points, and putting the contracts in place for the pieces of the inventory and the payrolls that aren’t naturally hedged. So, the only thing you can do is estimate it internally, estimate it with some facts and taking into the worst case if you will.

As far as the components maybe, Bob would want to add to it. I think around the world our freight management and our pricing was very strong in many countries and many regions, we still weren’t were able to realize what we believe would be the maximum or the appropriate level of back-in dollars, because goals set by certain manufacturers were still higher than market reality. And different countries, different regions had different success in negotiating reasonable goals and that continues into beginning of the new fiscal year.

So, the most challenging for the backend achievement and then I think the next challenging as we mentioned in our scripts, the competitive nature of the Americas environment particularly in the US where pricing has remained very competitive on a day in and day out basis.",1.0,0.0,2,1.0,2.0,1.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Lisa, for my first one, you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double-digit market share in servers by the middle of the year. I'm just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target? What's driving it? Is it just more instances at existing cloud customers? And as part of that, do you also have a share target for exiting this year?","Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the questions. So, look, we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping. We've been in market now four to five months, and the visibility that we have is, with the cloud guys, we have visibility to the public-facing instances, as well as what they're doing in terms of internal workloads. And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that they're using Rome with is expanding.
And then, on the enterprise side, you know, with the full portfolio of our partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, and the ODM partners, you know, we see just a significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome. So, we're very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market, and we feel good about our mid-year market share targets.

And also secondly, I think last quarter you guys talked about the success of integrating the marketing platform, something like 75% on that platform. Can you give us an update? And maybe a little bit implication on the efficiency of the marketing in the back half? Thanks.","Yeah. So, thanks, James. In terms of the CGS top priorities, it's really, as we move to one unified technology team and one unified architecture, the will -- the CTO is to define where we're going, how we're doing it, what the, what the rules of the road are, and how we do this integration from going to many stocks to few. And we created this multi-tenant extensible kind of set of capabilities. And I think that's an -- it's a broad process. it cuts across all the technology in our enterprise. And we're at this hard at work driving that. There's also, as we get to the backend, there's also the customer-facing side, which is all about the UI and UX. We want to be the first Company, and while driving progress to be that we want to be designed, focused and we have a focus on a new head of design, building out that capability and enterprise. So, it cuts across many things. And it's really about bringing excellence to all those disciplines so that we can just give the best customer experience we can and drive improvements across all the pieces, conversion, engagement, all the things we want to have. As far as the marketing question goes, and bringing our performance marketing together, I would say that number's up from 75 to probably closer to 85 to 90. But again, more than sort of a benchmark, which is to say it's how we're getting everything on common tools, common datasets, common algorithms, but it isn't -- what's exciting now is the opportunity to begin to test new algorithms, test opportunities across brands, test the opportunity to gain efficiencies and how we market multiple brands and performance marketing, et cetera. We're in the early days of that, but that is what these achievements of getting through this state have given us. And I would say, we're in a funny time where traffic patterns are unusual because of COVID. So, you're sort of testing into new algorithms and doing a lot of new performance marketing against the backdrop that's a little bit unusual and confusing. So, we don't always have the volumes to test everything, but there's a lot of exciting work going on there. And as I've said all along, we believe that we'll generate meaningful efficiencies and better operation in terms of performance marketing. But it is hard to benchmark because we don't have normal traffic levels and normal patterns. So, it's hard to say. It's going to give us an X percent more efficiency or why we have to see it as an action against the more typical backdrop. So more to come on that, but we are making steady and strong progress, and we're a long way down their consolidation of tools and data and all the things that those percentages reference.",1.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

No we have not seen really any change in utilization post pandemic. The gating factor really is being able to do the procedures and having the flow of the patients related to overall hospital operations, but so far we haven't seen any change.

NMBL,Q3,2016,Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first one is for Suresh. On the choices you guys are making with respect to investment I guess how does that change running the business going forward because it seems you were making some trade-off between commercial enterprises which impacted given the revenue line.And given your state of penetration of both segments very early I guess you need to have a lot more premium managing that cost base going forward and does that inject certain volatility into your results sort of think about how you think about managing the business going forward? And then clarification to revenue let's say miss that you guys are seeing is it because you lost deals and its really because the pricing environment is causing elongated sales cycle is that what you're saying just to be clear?,"Start with the second one which is the revenue decrease we are seeing is on the higher end, it’s the elongated sales cycle and the fact that in larger deals our win rates have been always sort of more challenge than in our lower end deals. And so I want to say the mix shift towards larger deals fits the explanation that you have given.The second reason for the revenue shortfall is that we did not have enough investments in our commercial business which translates into opportunity generation and pipeline and that's what we're reinvesting it. So that's just to give you a sense that both drivers were in place for us this quarter. On the larger question of what is our investment philosophy I will start by saying if I take a three year perspective, not much has changed from our perspective on what's likely to happen in this market. There is still a shift from disk centric architectures to flash centric architectures. We absolutely believe we have the broadest flash platform and one of the investments that we mentioned is in broadening the flash platform to address every form of deploying flash. And so we fundamentally believe that that shift is not being challenged and that legacy vendors will not be able to fight that shift back. So with that said, the constraint investment is what led us to not have as much growth as we aspired to. So we are going to invest more in the first half. I will also say that this is not at the same time abandonment of the belief that you need to both have the growth as well as operating leverage and that's why we believe in the second half you'll see operating leverage back compared to this year second half in our business model. So we continue to improve operating leverage and that will be the guideline we will use to drive our investments.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Are you -- is it mostly existing customers, talking about the contribution from new people you're bringing into the platform? What has sort of driving the growth of the core lodging business in the U.S., in the U.S. ex Vrbo so far?","Yeah. And all those go into the customer dynamics a little bit here, Brian, which is to say, I think during COVID broadly, as everybody was marketing somewhat less, we saw a lot of direct business. We're all -- we're happy about that, but it's more of a function of not going on the searching market unless we have people out in the market searching. I think as rebounded tethered more towards usual norms, but again, we've been perhaps somewhat more conservative on the performance marketing side because we -- with cancellation rates so high and other things -- other factors going on, closures, et cetera, itâ€™s easy to spend a lot on performance marketing and not get the return because people don't end up traveling. So, we are seeing, I would say, a mix relatively towards existing customers. I think that's what you'd see across the industry. Its why app usage is up and other things are growing. But, again, I think as the market is rebounding and more people are out in the market searching, you just start to see us get back to a more normal relationship between all the new Now, I will say a big part of our focus as an enterprise is to create longer-term relationships and greater lifetime value and stickiness and love for our brands with our customers.

But we do intend and we do plan to build those customer relationships in a different way. We hope, and historically, where we've all had to go fishing in the Google client or whatever and that was the only place to find their business. So, we're hoping to change those dynamics over time.

And how do you think the overall market there and the potential opportunity there is impacted by the Roche and Power ONO positive announcement. And then, secondly, on the TYK2 given the strong results you saw in moderate-to-severe patients and then, also the attempted advanced study in mild to moderate.
Any plans to maybe run an additional head-to-head study versus Otezla in a mild-to-moderate patient population to expand the opportunity?
","Well, the second one, probably I'll pass it on to Chris. So first one, I will say that for EFS for 816, you've seen the data already for the pathologic complete response is certainly very, very encouraging. Looking forward to the EFS readout toward the end of 2022, early 2023 time frame. So it still remains, from that perspective, on track.
And we'll certainly be sharing it as soon as we have that data available. Just one more thing that I want to clarify what I said early on, on Andrew's question around the speculation around the AdCom. The speculation that we hear is around the JAK inhibitors, and we have no knowledge around inclusion of TYK2 as being included in there. And that's why I just want to clarify one more time.

SMCI,Q3,2012,"Thanks for taking the questions. Howard I want to understand a little bit better the discussion on the hard disk drive impact as well as memory impact on the gross margin. Correct me, I think you said two thirds of the gross margin delta in the quarter was attributable to this, is that correct and therefore equating to about 165 basis points or is your guidance assuming with the pricing stabilizing that that comes back into model how are you thinking about gross margin in that context in this current quarter? ** And therefore equating to about 165 basis points or is your guidance assuming with the pricing stabilizing that, that comes back into the model, how are you thinking about gross margin in that context in this current quarter?","Hi, Aaron, yes. I said in the call that basically – you saw the decrease in margin of about 2.5% between quarters from 15.5% to about 13%.

SYK,Q2,2021,"Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned several times that how impressed you’re with Wright Medical now that you've kind of had it under your operating belt for a few quarters now. I’m just curious, is there other than just, the integration going better than planned, is there anything specifically either in the pipeline or embedded in that comment? It just, really, is surprising you to the upside or making you more excited about the future? You mentioned BLUEPRINT a few times, is something with BLUEPRINT. Just I'm curious if there's something that you're foreshadowing there, or physician general execution comment? Thanks.","Yes, so it was, we knew they had a good business. And we knew that their culture was similar to Strykers. But there's been some pleasant surprises along the way. Their talent is really excellent. And a lot of times when we buy companies, we buy them for their products. But then we have to infuse a lot of our management. They are a leader for upper extremities. They are a leader for lower extremities, are leading our businesses. Our head of knees came from Wright Medical. And so we've had an infusion of talent that for me has been a positive surprise. I mean, really outstanding leaders, their sales leader for upper extremities is outstanding and so that's been one positive.

The second I would say is their key opinion leaders. They absolutely work with fabulous key opinion leaders on both upper and lower extremities. And I would say that they are better key opinion leaders than we had within Stryker. And so those are two really, to me pleasant surprises. And just the pipelines, we thought they were good, they turned out to be a little better than we thought and that really applies across the board. So there are certain things that you know, when you do a public deal, you don't get to do the same amount of due diligence as you do with a private acquisition. And so those instincts, we had instincts that things were going to be good, they are proving to be even better than we first thought.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Thanks for taking the questions. The update on Wright was encouraging. It certainly sounds like the upper extremities piece continues to do very well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in lower extremities? That was probably the more challenging piece to integrate, curious how that business did versus 2019?","Yes, thank you Robbie. So first of all, sorry, Chris, thank you Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary. The podiatric volumes are coming back, so it was certainly a better quarter in Q2 then Q1, but it is lagging a little bit, just like we're seeing with spine and with hips and knees, it is a bit more elective those foot medical procedures, but I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place and as elective procedures comes back we do expect that will continue to grow.

It was a market improvement. We're not seeing the kind of disruption we saw early on with K2M through that integration. So I'm very bullish on Wright overall.

People are competing for a smaller base of patients and it becomes sort of more intense and more severe and yeah, I think we’ve that in both markets.

I think first of all, as a baseline if you think about a normal operating margin that was acquired through Wright Medical was, it was significantly less than say Stryker's normal operating margin. So if you think what have we worked on during this integration period, it was really pulling Wright Medical up and trying to look for all the synergies that we had built into our model, so that we could drive better operating margins at Wright Medical. I think fast forwarding into next year and looking at where that might look on a combined basis, I think we'll get back to our normalized, up margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points.

Particularly on guidance, as we're thinking about it, as we said is, right now we think the inventory build-up that came through is going to really sell mainly in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. As far as what we're watching closely for new patients starts in anticipation that that recovers in Q3 and we're back to normal in Q4. And as well as the infusion centers in the volumes returning to normal. And that would continue into 2021 on. What I would say is that the underlying performance of the business is very strong in the first quarter. And as you heard about what the product launches are confidence in those four product launches are coming this year, as well as the product launches next year. That gives us the confidence in reiterating our guidance for both this year and next year, but we're going to keep a very close eye on the macroeconomic factors that could wind up impacting entire industry as I talked about in my remarks. As far as the synergies, we continually review those synergies both internally as well as with our board. We are really pleased with the progress we've been making on the synergy front. And the progress with the third party vendors has done very, very well. And as far as getting the organization in place, the vast majority of our placements of the organization are done.

In Brazil even with the sort of the economic slowdown, we are seeing consumer food sales not just in our categories, but broadly across the industry continue to be a pretty solid.

Of course, since then, the inflation rate in brands and deflation rate in generics has changed, but let me talk about it this way. I mean, my comments on – are I think very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen. I can't talk about the others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way.

CTXS,Q3,2020,"Thanks guys, good numbers. Maybe you can talk about the bounce back in the cloud subscribers, how much of that was that one customer that you were missing last quarter, and how much of that was truly quarterly momentum? And then, as a follow-up, on the regional breakdown, I was kind of a little bit surprised to see the Americas not showing any growth. I think last quarter, you said that since openings in the U.S., we're lagging that in Europe. You would expect that kind of the Americas to be a quarter behind Europe as far as recovery, but it sounds like -- it looks like no year-over-year progression in the Americas, while Europe remained very strong for, I guess, three quarters in a row now. Help me reconcile your business with your original commentary.","Let me take a few of those questions. And then, Arlen, feel free to jump in here. So if you take a step back and you look at paid subscribers, you're right, we had really good sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. The -- there was an anomaly last quarter, which is taken out of a denominator for, obviously, going forward. So this is just net increases of about 800,000 new paid subscribers on a sequential basis. And it tracks very well to everything that we've talked about over the last six months. First half of the year was very focused from a customer point of view and, frankly, a Citrix point of view, on really helping customers move into the pandemic period, enable work from home, everything that was a high priority. Back half of the year, as I've stated a few times, is really focused on getting back to driving more of the strategy of the company, migrating existing users to the cloud, focusing on net new users in SaaS and in some cases, on-prem subscriptions. And so, we're just executing against what we've said before, happy with the progress on that side. And you clearly see it when you look at subscription ARR, which is now over $1 billion and continuing to grow north of 50% year-on-year. In terms of the geo mix, I'd say that, there's just a little bit of noise going on in there because of the geos being at different phases of the overall transition of subscription. That's really been led out of the Americas, and it's the thing more than anything that has influenced the year-on-year growth rates. EMEA, frankly, has had outstanding execution all year, both across our teams and the way we're operating from a solution standpoint in the various markets. They've just had really nice, steady progress. A little bit further behind in the overall subscription transition per se, but I'm just -- I'm very happy with the way that team has delivered.

OSUR,Q3,2020,"Thanks guys. Steve maybe just following on on the capacity side. I mean with the 1Q launch obviously kind of ramping at risk a little bit ahead of time, what type of capacity should we be expecting upon launch of the self-antigen test? I know you talked about expectations of selling pretty much everything you guys can make. So how are you thinking about capacity? And then at the same time, are you thinking about carving that up and directing a certain amount of capacity towards professional prescription OTC? What's the right way to think about that from your side?","Yes. So we are on plan for what we announced previously and that is, we're going to move from 35 million tests per year to 55 million tests per year by the first quarter of 2021 and 70 million tests per quarter by the third quarter 2021. And remember, embedded in that capacity is about 17 million to 18 million units per year of capacity for our existing HIV, HCV and Ebola tests. So when we come on stream ready to serve the professional market, we will have the capacity that you can calculate from our previous information. I think, we're going to sell as many as we can make for the professional products. And then, as we have more certainty about the timing for the Rx self-test and for the OTC self-test, we'll begin making allocation decisions about which products to get what capacity. I think we really do see a sweet spot in the self-test whether it's Rx or OTC and we'll make the combination that we need to from there. And I think as I've said before, the design considerations here are to try to make the same form factor and product design for all three use cases, professional Rx self-test and OTC self-test. That's an approach that I think -- I don't think any other company has taken in the marketplaces yet.

We have said that we expect the gross margin percentage to be at least as good as for our other products.

But at the same time, the projection of growth that we are experiencing now on the offshore locations, I would say it's at a more controllable state.

I think it's important to provide some context. So with AML it's a very poor prognosis disease even in the newly diagnosed setting where we look at five year survival rates of around 15% to 25%, depending on the age of patients. And even saying that most patients do have a complete response, but 80% of those patients will relapse within 18-months. So, we're very excited about the fact that CC-486 has delivered a 10 months survival benefit in that setting. So, I think that's really important. And as we think about the opportunity, it's about 33,000 patients overall. And then if you think about the relapse rates, you can start to think about the epi-related to the disease. But the fact that we've added 10 months survival benefit, we've doubled the relapse free survival benefit. I think we're very excited about the commercial potential, not only in terms of impacting those patients’ outcomes, but also the opportunity now to establish a maintenance treatment paradigm in AML, which other drugs have tried and we haven't seen survival benefit before in the maintenance setting. So, I think from our perspective now having clarity on PDUFA date, the launch team preparations are going very well indeed. And we remain very excited about the opportunity to CC-486.

CTXS,Q3,2020,"Thanks very much. Arlen, I've got a couple for you. A little bit more modeling questions. First, if you could maybe help define what sharply negative means when you're talking about Q1, are we talking down 5%, 8%? Just -- that's not typical language you guys use for revenues. They're normally quite steady. So maybe you could help us there. And then secondly, just on the operating margin front, there's, as you're aware, a fairly healthy debate among investors about whether COVID and the crisis has fundamentally changed the margin structure of software companies as reps don't need to be flying every day and conferences can be virtual, et cetera. You didn't explicitly provide margin guidance for 2021, but your revs and EPS guide look, maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like up 75, 100 bps, something like that. Where do you land on that question of whether the crisis we're in has changed the margin outlook of Citrix in the broader sector? Thanks so much.","Sure. Thanks, Karl. I think when you think about 2021, obviously, we had a 20% growth rate in the first quarter. And there's work for us to do in terms of how we think about the business. And we're certainly not in a position to provide quarter-by-quarter guidance when we think about 2021 at this point. But I think we just wanted to help you in your model to start to get your arms around the concept that it's going to be challenging because we're going to be writing SaaS licenses for these converted customers. And so there will be a headwind. We, obviously, as we go into fourth quarter, we'll be able to provide more guidance. But David and I thought it was important just to make that everyone recalls the significant growth rate we had in the first quarter last year, and obviously, we take that into account as we think about normalization and acceleration through 2021. The second question around op margin. I think my two sense are, obviously, you're going to have decreases in travel, but you're going to have increases in other areas in terms of enablement and employee empowerment and helping your employees make the right decision for them based upon their role and where they can be most effective in getting their jobs done. As we think about that as a company, that's what we do. And so we, as a company, will continue to invest in our business to ensure we have the right processes, tools and infrastructure in place to make our customers successful. So I don't see it fundamentally changing our business. I think that there will be a lot of companies that have to address needs of their employees by moving money from one portion of their P&L to another. There certainly could be from a real estate and from other areas longer term benefits. But when I look at our business, I think David and I see great opportunities to grow this company, and I think you'll continue to see us invest towards those growth opportunities.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"Thanks very much. Devinder, you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop-in game console chips.

Or if not, roughly, what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for, say, PC processors and GPUs? Do you get server processors sales rising sequentially?","No, I don't think I said specifically that Q4 to Q1 is all due to semi-custom. That obviously helped the margin, but there is a product mix underneath that helps, especially with the notebook products, that we talked about, that are moving to seven nanometers.

ABC,Q4,2016,"Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to go back, Steve, to your comment where you talked about different pricing strategy for specialty, and you have new long-term contracts now in place with a number of your customers. My understanding is that historically, it was a branded bucket, that specialty was included in a generic bucket, and now trying to break out specialty. Can you talk about what the new pricing strategy looks like? And am I correct in thinking that when it was in the branded budget, you were discounting that, similar to branded where maybe it's WAC minus 3%? And what could the new economics look like in the new separation of specialty?","Yeah, Lisa, I mean, I'd say essentially you're accurate on my commenting on the WAC minus 3%, but you're essentially accurate. I mean, we had such a good surge in generic compliance and generic rates that maybe our industry was not as thoughtful about this as we should. And then we had that really fall off and specialty products increase so much, which are very expensive. And there is an argument with the manufacturer, there's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market-based fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult time, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend and we're working hard, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important weighting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that there's a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service.

And did I hear right that perhaps less than a third of revenue is what you are looking for, is that correct?","Yes. We are not breaking out specifically (inaudible). It's roughly a third of our business in Q4 and it's going to be sequentially down in Q1. Verizon's sell-through from a net subscriber adds, we are down about 25% Q3 to Q4.

AAPL,Q2,2009,Thanks very much. Your gross margin guidance seemed to – seems to imply that you expect an unreasonably strong education selling season at least in terms of mix. Was that in consideration and combined with the desktop refresh? Can you help us understand why you expect about a 4.5% sequential revenue decline into the June quarter at its midpoint?,"Sure. As we were putting our guidance for the June quarter together, a couple of things. First of all, last year in a much better economy, our Q3 revenue was down 1% sequentially. This year our guidance provides for a couple of more points of – of sequential decline. Now however it is important to point out that we are guiding for year-over-year growth on a GAAP basis and we would expect our adjusted sales growth to be even higher. But as we think about this year, first, the economy and its continuing impact on consumers and business and the education buying season which we begins this quarter, I discussed earlier that the June quarter is more dominated by K-12 that’s an institution sale and we expect things to be competitive this year given the economy and the funding situations. And we expect some reductions in ASP sequentially as we usually experience in the June quarter. Second, we will not begin to recording revenue on new iPhone sold since our March 17th event. And we will start that when we release the iPhone OS 3.0 software this summer. And finally, I talked a bit about in some of the gross margin discussion the currency environment and we expect the dollars to have an impact not only on gross margin, but of course on our revenue as well largely related to where we got the quarter hedged and the current spot rates.",2.0,2.0,2,0.0,2.0,2.0
SYK,Q2,2021,"Thanks, I'll also add another great congratulations on another great quarter. The first one from me would be on deferred backlog procedures some of your competitors is recently even as this quarter are sort of putting numbers against that and I am sort of wondering if there's a number internally at Stryker that you could share on specific to the hip and knee business, what amount of deferred backlog is still out there and how long do you think that will be a driver for the business?

And the second one I'll put up there as well on Wright, you mentioned Kevin, second half cross synergy selling potential into the second half and would assume that extends into next year, just sort of trying to quantify that is, is that a couple of 100 basis points and is that net of the synergies? Thanks again.","Yes, so first with regards to your question on the deferred backlog, we don't have a specific number. I mean, there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic, and so it's super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that different backlog or that are new patients.

What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outside growth figures that happened in any one particular quarter or month, but that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters.

So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. What you think about is thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross selling component is something that, as I mentioned, is we're pleased with the start of that. It's early in the process. We're expecting that as you mentioned to continue for the rest of this year and into next year. We haven't provided a specific size of that opportunity, but it's baked within the overall guidance that we've provided for the overall combined trauma and extremities business, which as I mentioned we expect to grow at least 6% compared to 2019. That also does include the synergy component as well.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
ODP,Q3,2010,"Thanks, JPMorgan. I want to follow up on the timing question, Neil. And reflecting back a few months ago, I guess, February, March time frame, you re-upped Steve's contract and added a three-year retention package, which frankly, was just kind of exchanging value for his option to leave around this time of the year, given the changes of control costs. So I just want to follow up and really understand the timing, and what's really changed versus six or seven months ago?","I think, as I said, it's really a coincidence. The contract discussions got started a while back, given the BC Partners investment and the change in control issued. They only got signed in the first quarter, so you're really looking at a time period there, where we've had almost nine to 10 months from the time the discussion started about changing the contract or renewing the contract with the effective event that we have this week. So it was just one of these things, where as I said earlier, there's never a good time to make a change. Both sides decided that it was appropriate at this point. And again, we want to say, it had nothing to do with the SEC issue. It was unfortunate that it's come out that way, but that's not the facts.",0.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0

That metric has been under pressure for the last several years, although it's shown a lot of stabilization recently.
And even though you don't breakout phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that pressure as subs moved into EIP and more recently into the unlimited plans. It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us. I'm not entirely sure we are in the migration to the new unlimited plan. So I guess, I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward? Do we still have any headwind on the phone side? Is that becoming a tailwind? And then, of course, you've highlighted that you were seeing a lot of other devices, including wearables coming into your accounts.
Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.
","Good morning, Brett, thanks for the questions. So as you look at ARPA, you're right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete, the year-over-year difference in terms of the percentage of the base on unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits, whereas a year ago it was much more significant. So that shows up in the ARPA. The other good thing that's in the ARPA though is you continue to see the demand for our products and services.
So we continued in the quarter to have customers step up in terms of the plans thereon, whether that be from a metered plan to unlimited or even within our unlimited plans that we offer, and then we continue to see increases in connections per account, whether that be wearables or additional phones on the account. Those things are coming through to ARPA, and you see the impact there on service revenue overall. So certainly, ARPA is stabilizing and we think as we continue to offer the right plans to customers and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans, that it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.

AMD,Q4,2019,"Thanks. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor? Have you seen any benefit from that? If not, why not? And then, kind of Part B is, Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year, and they'll focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share. What effect will that have on the pricing in the market? And does your full-year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition?","Yeah. So, when we look at the PC market, we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market, both mobile and desktop. I think that's primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have. There are some discussions about, let's call it, pockets of shortages.
But, you know, as I said before, I don't believe -- we've been on this steady increase in market share now for the last eight quarters, and we believe we've gained share in Q4 as well, so, I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger. As we go into 2020, I think we are again enthusiastic about our products. In addition to the Zen 2-based desktop products, we've added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio, and we'll have that for the full year of 2020. So, I think our outlook expect growth in all businesses, including the PC business.
And we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumers, as well as commercial PCs.

UNVR,Q1,2017,"Thanks. And in EMEA, can you talk about the mix improvement you got there particularly with pharmaceuticals? And how sustainable that might be going forward in 2017/ I think you called out that some of the improvement you saw in EMEA is due to extra billing days and some of this mix is not going to be sustainable through the rest of the year. How should we do that in the second quarter?","Good question, Jim. It's Carl. The improvement in EBITDA in the quarter was -- about half attributable to our pharmaceutical finished goods business that is more rightfully looked at it as an easy comp. Last year's first quarter was abnormally low in sales based on the selling patterns in that market. And so, we got to boost and amplify it to the growth in the quarter. Excluding that end market, we had 13% growth in the quarter in EBITDA. So I think that you are right. Going into the second, we won't get that kind of growth in the second quarter because of that easy comp in pharma, but we do hope to continue to execute against our restructured business there in Europe and continue the growth going.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
BLDR,Q2,2019,Thanks. And then I want to go back to a something in your guidance that you said. You said that gross margin to normalize above 26% in fourth quarter. I wonder what do you mean by normalize you're talking about in for Q4 are you talking about more of a longer term run or you think you you're going to stay above it that 26% level?,"Yes, both of those. So, we've talked about in the past, people have frequently asked us what is normal. You guys talk about gross margin impacts due to commodity fluctuations, but what's at app our current and then based on the current prices, which is important part of the equation always but we think it's about 26. We were a little cautious as we bond throughout the year that to snap that line, because we wanted to see where things have settled. But as we work through the year, we think that's a good guide for everyone that based on current commodity prices, it's not 25 as normal in the fourth quarter and going forward we think normal is over 26.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

We believe consumers know our category is a treat, they know it has sugar and so we expect that we'll see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will.

NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess looking forward, what changes in large enterprise given that the incumbents are willing to price aggressively and they get the last bid. What can you do to change those dynamics? And then secondly, should we now assume that the goal of breakeven is off the table until you start to see that enterprise business really ramp as expected? Thank you.

","Yes. Let me address the first one, Katie. I want to start by saying, when you look at our business in terms of mix of Fibre Channel, when you look at our business in terms of bookings from deals over 250,000, 500,000 notwithstanding the competitive environment and the pricing environment those are growing and growing faster than our overall business. And they are becoming a larger portion of our mix. And so let me start by saying that the trajectory of what we're seeing at the high-end of our business is moving along well. Our concern is that the kind of return we wanted from our investments, we were essentially looking for more leverage in those investments than we're seeing. So, it's more a question of how long before they become as productive as our commercial segment rather than that we are not able to make progress. So, it's much more of profitability question rather than success in the enterprise question. Now with that said, that goes back to your second part of the question which is, what do we expect from a profitability standpoint? It is true that we've not given specific guidance on when we expect to get back to breakeven. The investments we’re making in the first we believe will take the first half of next year and that's when we're going to see sort of most of the investments concentrated. And so second half you should start to say leverage again in our model relative to this year. Beyond that we're not getting specific on what that translates into for breakeven.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

FOSL,Q1,2018,"Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Good progress on your plan. With wearables really starting to become a much more significant part of the mix, it sounds like you guys are much more confident on the trajectory in that category and your position in the category. Is that a fair characterization? And then as a follow-on to that, if you look at the current offering, the offering you've had over the holiday and you have now in the wearables, what are some of the opportunities to improve that offering?

The first is as we mentioned in Q4, the wearables business model that's taken us a lot of heavy lifting over the last two years is now in place and scaling. So, it's a dramatic improvement in product. The advantage supply-chain we implemented largely last year is now unlocking substantially lower cost of goods sold and increasing margins, and then our teams are just executing really, really well across the business. So that's first takeaway. Second is we are delivering yet again another significant step up in product and innovation. As Kosta mentioned, this year, the most dramatic improvement's going to be on fitness and health and wellness features that will be – we had a couple of SKUs last year in Q4. We'll be very broad now in implementation of those across our product suite, which will bring us to parity in – against the market leaders in the wearables space and also allow us to tap into a whole another set of consumers that without those features, we have not been able to reach successfully.

We seem to be getting somewhat of a viral impact where the more people wear them, the more they tell their friends about them. We're seeing pretty good sell-throughs on that. So, from our perspective, we've got some great new products coming the back half of the year. A lot of it is more health and wellness oriented, great new technology, new software, the product is getting better and better. So, we think we're in good position for that. In addition to that, our situation with traditional watches, we saw sequential improvement in sell-through during the first quarter that is kind of compelling to us. You also have noticed that the Swiss watch business is getting better. So, there could be some incidental activity going on and just the interest in overall watches. In our experience, when the upper end of a business gets good, we have a follow-on effect from that and watches just like any other cyclical business, it's not good until it is and we're putting a lot of innovation and differentiation into the marketplace as much as possible, telling new stories. So now we're in a position with both traditional watches, with ramping up our innovation and differentiation and also with wearables, we're bringing new products to market, our addressable market is actually much larger. Wearables last year was an $18 billion business, growing to $33 billion in three years.

HSY,Q3,2020,"Thanks. Good morning. A question on your share gains in the US and particularly in chocolate, you really -- and in your prepared remarks, you touched on this, how adaptive you were by market, by channel, by need state and in terms of S'mores. Some of that's related or might be related to supply chain, could you talk about that part of it and I think the reason I'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor, maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in '21? And I have a follow-up.","Yeah, absolutely. So I would say I believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands, our consumer understanding, our programming as well as to the supply chain execution and execution at retail, both of which tend to be core advantages for us as a company.
So I think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers. And as you mentioned, we really pivoted with the consumers, so very early on, we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing and we've talked to all of you before about the fact that our category splits, a third a third a third, take home, instant consumable and seasonal.
And as we saw consumer shift to more at-home behaviors, we, very early on, shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial-up S'mores, Twizzlers for movie nights, our baking product activities. And then within the seasons even with Halloween, we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a Halloween season versus back away from it. And everything related to that relative to let's set the season early, so we can get consumers in in pre-trick-or-treat, let's make sure we are smart about the portfolio that's out there and not overly index to seasonal SKUs, etc.
And then, we worked really hard on messaging to message consumer's safe ways to celebrate the Holiday. We dialed up e-commerce, as consumers shifted to e-commerce and because we had invested in capabilities in that, we were able to do that.
And then, I think a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well. And some of those go beyond supply chain. So we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends.
We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media investments to target better. And certainly, we've invested in our plans all along the way, which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really be able to continue to execute and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail.
So, as I think about -- think about that share gain, I would say clearly, we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of '21. We would expect that they would moderate after that, though we're certainly expecting to hold on to share.

In some of these challenging times, I think customers do question their supply chain strategies more. And so I think the conversations we’re having right now are things that customers were considering, but I think the COVID situation is pushing them to move a little bit quicker.

So one item you mentioned that you look to gain share back with the lost buying group from 2015, was that effort limited in scale to APCI (55","Yeah, I'll make a quick comment on each of those three. We did lose a buying group customer. It was a customer where a lot of the members were GNP members and a lot of them chose to stay with us. But I don't want to get too much into specifics. It's not that overall material. I think it's always interesting, lose a relationship with a – and I think it's a shared relationship, between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why that having long-term contracts is extremely important, so that we can work together on what – the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script. So I think actually that last year is a pretty good example of that and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC, but not – it's one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything, or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independents is very – I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we've signed. And we did work to try – keep some of those former buying group customers that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market, because again, people talk to each other. It's an efficient market, so we want to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the telemarketers, I would say are struggling a bit, because I think ourselves and our peer companies are looking at that compliance factor and have better tools to manage that. And there's not the growth that you had from so many new product launches. And I talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, no need for you to order from a telemarketer.

How much of this is sort of commodities or labor or traffic, if you could sort of parse through those pieces?","Alex just to be clear, really we were targeting, we think around a 3% comp sales level of sales growth is -- gives us, you know, a good shot at -- at holding margins, as we've said -- said before. We did not mean to imply we need more check growth than that. What we did see is some weakening in traffic relative to Q1 and the trends. So, you know, all of the things that we're working on, you know, we'd rather see, you know, the balance between check growth in that 3% range, which as you -- you'll recall, we fell short of that in Q1 for a variety of issues for most -- most prominently the promotional calendar and some of the interactions of loyalty with some of our beginning of the year promotions. So we're happy that, you know, Tri Tip has helped us a lot. We've continued to be wiser, if you will, around the balance of -- of promotions. So, you know, in a perfect world what we'd like to see is, you know, maintain 3% check growth. Ob -- obviously, as long as it's productive check growth, we'd take more but we're not sitting here trying to drive checkup further, we're trying to drive traffic.",2.0,0.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

ACAT,Q1,2012,"Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. In 2011, you gave us an ATV shipment number and an ATV sell-through number. And, if I recall, there was a several thousand unit gap between the two. Did that persist through 2012 and can you give us those numbers?","It did persist in 2012, not to the same degree. But I did say that inventory was down 22% for ATV, Wildcat and Prowler. I said it was down 26% for just ATV and Prowlers. So, obviously, with the inventory being down, we shipped a lot less units than we retailed.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
BIO,Q4,2016,"Thanks. Just one follow-up for you, Christine. Could you quantify the actual dollars related to ERP that was in the P&L in 2016? And I know you already said that that's $3 million to $5 million higher in 2017. Just curious if you could give us what the base actual dollar number is for the project?","So, when we think about the project, there's spend directly associated with the project and then there's kind of this ancillary spend where we have a lot of temporary help that's backfilled while our good people are working on the project. And where we've been running, and as you know, is kind of that $25 million to $30 million a year for the project itself and then maybe an extra $10 million or so in the related costs, if you will. That doesn't include depreciation, but really more about this backfill. So if you add those two together, we're high 30s for 2016 and 2017 is pretty similar and then should go down from there. And again, the reason is pretty similar is we're anticipating a fair amount of health in the stabilization and continuing to need to backfill as we go through that period.",2.0,1.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
AXGN,Q2,2018,"Thanks. Just quickly back, I want to follow-up on the agencies, the 19. Can you give us a broad estimate of how many people are working at those places today? And then it sounds like I know that number has been fairly consistent, so this wasn't anything that came up with sort of new early ones that were more recently added, but maybe it sounds like the splitting of the territory is the same thing that caused disruption -- in the direct might have caused some disruption there, is that the right way to think about it?","So, in the last question, no, the distraction actually I think was external to us. Our solution was to split the territories. When you -- all of these, I think -- what do I see, all of these agencies have multiple people in them that carry our products, but they range in size quite a bit. Some of them are small and with only two sales associates and they can be as high as more than 10 to 12 associates carrying our product. They also have quite a bit of variation in geography. Some of them are -- really a few cities and others have multiple states. And so what our plan is to continue to look at these and will they perform and do a great job and continue to drive the kind of growth that a direct rep does. I'm very happy to work with them. Where they don't hit their quota and they underperform or get distracted with other aspects of their business or are worth hiring new people and get distracted, then our drive is to say that they may not be able to carry our products. And we are very upfront with them about that. It says it's all about hitting the number. And I think they understand that's their job. And they have a relationship. And we have an good enough communications channel that we can continue to talk to them to say well if you see something coming, then we'll go ahead and trade it out. I mean that's what our goal is to end these things in a smooth transition for the people that are their customers as well as our customers. Remember they are calling these customers for other products as well and they don't want to leave them high and dry. So, we have a good win-win to try and do an effective transition in that case.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TAP,Q3,2008,"Thanks. Kevin, I have a couple of questions relating to Canada. I’m trying to put the picture together, looking out beyond the next quarter. You’re seeing cross margins start to decline. You’re saying that pricing is picking up but the volume leverage is slowing down a bit, so is there any reason not to think gross margin will continue to be down year-on-year over the next few quarters given the relationship between price and the cost pressures? That’s a local currency question. Then I have another question when we bring that back into US dollars.","There are a number of things you’ve referred to. First, I think when you reflect on the third quarter it’s been a really strong volume quarter with some cost inflation issues. As you look at commodity prices there was a lag as commodity prices went up, and there will be a lag as commodity prices are coming down. There are a number of other factors in there. We’re very hopeful that this trend will continue and that we’ll benefit from that. That’s the first comment. I think in the very short term the question about volume and things is reflected in the first month of this quarter. As I said to Christine, there is some loading in Quebec on the price increase that I mentioned. That will work its way through, so I wouldn’t assume it’s necessarily going to be a flat quarter. We’re hopeful that it will be what it’s historically been at about 1%. Going forward, cogs in local currency will be our challenge in order to get to flat, but there’s some work ahead of us in order to be able to deliver on that. It’s a challenge we are taking on.",2.0,2.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
OCX,Q1,2020,"Thanks. Mitch, what kind of – I guess two parts to this question. What kind of pricing are you currently getting for RX and what percent of the test that you run are you actually getting payment for?","So to date we have build – we have holding all the CMS payments because we need a final price before we do that. So somewhere between now and June 13, when we begin on the 14, we will get that price and we’ll be able to submit those. And as we’ve discussed publicly, we really had had a really powerful dossier that Padma and team put together. We believe that because of the end of life cost in lung cancer that we have a really good support for our $4,000 asking price. As I said, publicly I think that sometimes you might as well hit the easy button and they’ll crosswalk it to the test that it’s equal, if you will, in terms of the endpoint and that is Genomic Health OncoCyte DX, same endpoint but different disease and that is about $3,800 today. But in the private pay world we have submitted our bills at our list price. And to date, the couple that we’ve had that were private payers, keep in mind, over 70% are CMS eligible patients. So the few that we’ve had that were private pay, they have accepted our list price. But to be honest, Keay, that’s not unusual in the early days of a new launch like this. They are accepted because the patient – because of the high deductible plan the patient ends up having to pay a good bit of that. And so we will get recognized by these payers. And if the physician that orders it does a good justification, we will indeed get paid but it won’t be at the list price. Ultimately when CMS gives us our price, we’ll use that as leverage to go in and start negotiating our price at these private payers. We prefer not to begin that until – just historically, people that go before CMS tend to not always get the best value. It’s better to fight for with a really powerful dossier the price you want and then use that as your benchmark for private payers. And so that is our strategy.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
OCX,Q1,2020,"Thanks. Mitch, what kind of – I guess two parts to this question. What kind of pricing are you currently getting for RX and what percent of the test that you run are you actually getting payment for?","Yes. I think you’re hitting the high point well. For some of the competitors, for Merck as you said, moving from second line to first line is an opportunity and to have a biomarker that actually works much better for identifying responders is an opportunity to enter first-line therapy market. And as well as a 40% response rate is not good enough and the side effects are very significant, so in our conversations with physicians and CMS it’s very clear that there is room for improvement in biomarker performance and a biomarker that clearly demonstrated an incremental improvement on the existing paradigm would be very attractive both for health economic reasons and for patient management reasons. So in terms of pushback, I think the market has really been waiting for a good phenotypic assessment, a good assessment of what’s going on in the tumor specimen. We think ours is excellent at that. And so I don’t think that we’re getting much pushback aside from sort of the process of maturing the data.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
OCX,Q1,2020,"Thanks. Mitch, what kind of – I guess two parts to this question. What kind of pricing are you currently getting for RX and what percent of the test that you run are you actually getting payment for?","Yes. One thing I would add, Keay, that I think is very positive. They do love the fact that this is a PCR test. It’s RNA-seq or PCR and the PCR test as you might imagine means that there are over 10,000 clinical placements of multiplex PCR instruments around the world. So that should we get a positive companion diagnostic outcome for pharma, we would have a very broad install base to apply a kit strategy too outside the U.S. and that is something that none of these other capabilities or none of these other tests that can provide. PD-L1 is a pathology assay and we do understand that’s important, but it is also subjective versus something as specific and sensitive as a multiplex PCR result. So there’s been a lot of interest in that and a lot of excitement that we would have that large an install base to ensure their drug launched in any country would have access to the test to drive its utility.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0
NMBL,Q3,2016,"Thanks. So Suresh, if I back out your Fibre Channel business from the rest of the business, iSCSI, I noticed that for the last three or four quarter's [as soon as you] [ph] started shipping fiber channel, the iSCSI contribution has kind of plateaued in the high-50s. I recognized your explanation around commercial enterprise, but it appears as if most of your growth going forward is likely to come from Fibre Channel and the iSCSI market has kind of reached a level where you potentially cannot grow going forward. Is that a fair characterization, or why not?","Yeah. Rajesh I’ll go back to what I said, really there are two things going on. One, as we shifted some investment towards going after both large enterprises and larger deployments across our customer base, that’s come at the cost of investments in our traditional midsize enterprise customer base. And that's really where iSCSI was particularly strong. And so you would -- as I've said in the past, the mix of protocol is as much a reflection of our sales capacity investments as a reflection on the market. And so as I described our one of our corrective actions being focused on reinvesting in commercial that's really aimed at making sure we get midsize customers back and that tends to be more dominated by iSCSI as a protocol.",2.0,2.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
PM,Q1,2016,"Thanks. So, as we think about the cadence of profit growth and earnings growth this year, clearly we're still in a period of more accelerated rollout costs behind iQOS. I don't know if it's – I may be asking for too much detail here, but can you give us a rough sense for how material the step-up in investment was as a headwind to earnings growth this quarter? Or how it compares to Q4? And you mentioned in the release that the earnings growth profile could be more second-half-weighted than Q4-weighted. So just wondering if you could sort of help set expectations for Q2?","Actually, you're always asking for lot of details, right? Look, let me put it this way, absent the iQOS partially comps but also increased investment, I guess the cost for the quarter would come about flat. Essentially that would be flat. So all the cost growth in the quarter you could – one could attribute it to the investment behind iQOS. It's obviously on ex-currency, always on ex-currency basis. To give a bit more light into how we see the quarters going forward, we still are to confirm that our outlook for the total costs for the year, and this is now all-inclusive again on ex-currency basis or conventional and RRP, Reduced-Risk Products on ex-currency basis, the cost outlook still remains at about 1% for the full year. So we'll have, obviously, some comps issues in the quarters. If you look at the pacing of our growth rate, if I take it on an EPS level, second, third, fourth quarter, look, as much as we would be explaining the difficult comps in the Q1 of this year, I mean, clearly we will all have a different situation, 180 degrees different situations in Q4 of this year. So obviously one should expect there quite a strong, very strong actually growth rate on EPS level in Q4. And in Q2 and in Q3, we will be going somewhere below obviously the guidance which we gave for the full year. This will very much also depend on the timing of some expenses, et cetera. I think revenue line is going be cruising closer to what we said is for the full year, so somewhere in a corridor of a 5% to 6% quarter this year versus the quarters of the last year. We should see the evolutions of our revenue. So it's much more the differences which we have in comps coming from the investment, partially behind the conventional, but very much obviously driven by the deployment of iQOS.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

PLXS,Q1,2021,"Thanks. Thanks for that color. And by the way, yes, I think you gave some good color on how we should be thinking about the second half of the year. but yes, I wanted to go to that target that you’re talking about for revenue of 9% to 12% growth. And clearly, last year was impacted unquestionably by COVID and this year you’ve got some moving parts as well. but I’m trying to get a sense, what’s giving you that confidence about that 9% to 12% revenue growth. It sounds like, it’s the – the wins that are coming in, it’s a question of when do you potentially see that conversion? It’s obviously not going to, I think, happen this year?","Yes. So, I think, Jim, you’re right on with your assessment about this year is that the 9% to 12% would be difficult in this year and kind of the way I’ve characterized it in the release and in the script here is that. if you do the math, it wouldn’t add up to the 9% to 12%, but there’s a number of things that give us confidence that 9% to 12% is a realistic and very achievable goal. And first of all, if we look backward looking over the period of 18% to 20%, we were at 10%. So, our sectors in our markets have shown that they can support that level of growth. Then, if we look – and that includes last year with the pandemic in that number as well, I know as we go through our planning process and we do a bit of a bottoms-up planning our teams again, their results support our revenue growth goals, but there’s really four factors that I think serve as catalyst for us as we go into – go through fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022. First of all, we have the margin expansion and the sustainable margin expansion, which I think we’re doing a nice job of showing that that’s very achievable. Second, we’ve got the recovery of elective - of medical equipment used for elective procedures, and we’re starting to see that a hint of a sign of that right now. but I wouldn’t say it’s a recovery by any means. So, there’s great opportunity with that as we move forward. And there’s also the increase in demand that we expect to see from commercial aerospace as we see travel upticks post the COVID vaccine rollout. So that may be an early 2022 type event is what we’re expecting. And then we have the new program ramps and you saw the win success that we’ve had over $1 billion trailing four quarter funnel that we have. We’ve talked about some of the exciting new programs that have been long-term ramps within our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector. These all come to fruition in the F22-ish type timeframe here. So, we’ve got a number of catalysts that are looking really good for us as we get beyond or get – go through fiscal 2021 and get into fiscal 2022.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
RAIL,Q4,2013,"Thanks. With the closure of one of the repair shops, is there more to do there with additional shops that you would close?","No, now I think our strategy is going to remain in at the same in growing that. The facility we closed has been a different geographic, it didn’t have the dynamics, of being on a high volume quarter like our shops out in the Nebraska are. So it is just a different decision, I think, there are other shops so we still like to still see an opportunity to grow our value from those.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
DOV,Q2,2008,"Thanks. Wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see changing on three items for the second half of the year, that you've addressed that sort of implicitly a bit first, on organic growth, 5.5% or so, this quarter, very strong. Looks like on a book-to-bill, we ought to see that pullback a bit. And then wondered if you could also talk about this raw material price, continuing into the second half. You're being cautious on it. Is that just based on the macro factors? Or do you have some visibility on that, continue getting tougher for you?","Kind of addressing each of those questions, certainly from an organic growth standpoint, we've identified that we forecast 4 to 5% organic growth through the remainder of the year. There's not a lot of acquisitions that we did in the end of '07 that will fuel acquisition growth. So we still feel pretty good about that number. I would also say that referring to, back to our book to bill I think, we kind of covered it fairly well in the last comments but there wasn't anything significant in the market that really caused us to see a significant change in business level. We were up year-over-year. We continue to feel very strong about the oil market. We continue to believe their product ID is going to hold up well. Electronics certainly has a nice comeback in the quarter where we would like to think that we'll see some of that hold up, but that's always a bit of a variable market. But we still feel pretty good about the economy right now. Terry, it's been a pretty strong year so far. Racking the raw material prices, I think we've done a number of things to prepare our companies to be less a more proactive as it relates to the raw material pricing and kind of how we handle that. We did a lot of moves of our companies to Mexico to other Eastern block companies to increase our presence in Asia over the last couple of years. There was cost associated with that. I think we are getting the benefit of that now. I think our companies have internal initiatives on synergy. They are making it more efficient and then I think we are doing a much better job of analyzing the real value we bring to our customers and appropriately pricing through that. And I think those things in total have caused us to offset majority of our raw material price increases year-to-date.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
CTXS,Q3,2020,"Thanks. You touch on in an earlier question, but can you elaborate further on any recent changes you've made to incentivize and encourage customers to shift to the cloud offering?","Yes. Robert, I'd say it's less about customer incentives and more about internal things that we're doing. And so really the – probably the most important, most pronounced, of course, is engineering and innovation and things that we're doing individually to deliver high quality, resilient, feature-rich solutions. That's just a given. Second thing is, how do we look at their environment and make it easier. And that includes the work that we're doing around migration tools, around customer success programs, around architectural guidance and we'll continue to execute on that. And then the work we do with partners like Microsoft and Google and Amazon and others to try and help them migrate not just the Citrix component, but the underlying workloads in a more holistic approach. We're going to keep pushing on all three of those. We are making some adjustments as we look into the future around internal incentives to make sure that we're putting a higher importance on transition of the install base, I think we're at that point where we can do that we should do that now, aligning that not only across our field facing resources but across the entire company.

HSY,Q3,2020,"That makes a lot of sense. And then one more question on the -- I'm sticking with follow-ons to Chris' questions, which I thought were solid. The early part of the season versus the latter part of the season. The earlier part of the season was exceptionally robust and you said late part was a bit softer, but in -- somewhere in your remarks, I think you said all in total Holiday, so both early part and late part finished down mid-single digits for the category.
I think mathematically to get the category down mid-single digits, we're going to have to see some pretty, pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we capture that late part of the season. Am I thinking about it right, am I interpreting your comments correctly?","Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So category was down mid-single digits overall as much as our business was actually up and we will see some of those declines. And Jason, one other thing to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the Nielsen and IRI data, given the season was on a Saturday versus a Thursday and based on retail reporting days. So you will probably even see it's down even more. And you'll have to wait till kind of mid-November till you see some of those last couple days being reported. So some of it when you see will be just the timing shifts of the day of the week and some of it will certainly be the declines in trick-or-treat at the end.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And then just thinking about the body’s natural studies looks like the collections have been played a bit, which makes sense due to COVID.

And I’m sure you know, mostly it was due to COVID? How significantly could that delay the first 510(k) submission for DLBC, because we talked about the timelines in the past and just wondering how far was there now pushed out to 10-Q?","Yes, that is a very good question. And I don’t have the firm timelines, and I don’t know, updates and have to re update, but it is tough updating in the moment with COVID going. That is the primary reason was what you said. And as I’m sure you were, it is been a tough 15-months to be collecting trials in the U.S. for cancer. So an EDRN study is still paused. I don’t want to half answer that question. Because we are not I don’t think anyone really knows exactly what is happening at the moment with collections. And so we are doing as much as we can to really work out the new timescale and how much it is delayed. But I would strongly expect it is going to be at least a quarter or two, given everything. So that is just speculative at the moment, and we are looking at ways perhaps we can get things back on track time wise. But as I said, yes, it is just been a really tough time.

I know you're continuing to see good strength in new contract awards that probably have upfront capital requirements are. Is this kind of run rate on capital additions and CapEx? Is this - do we kind of expect this cadence for the rest of the year? I know, you've got longer term goals, but just trying to get a sense of CapEx over the next few quarters. Thanks.","Well, thanks, Joe, for the kind of words upfront, and I guess, I would say to you that my remarks we talked about CapEx for the year and we know we've given that color at year-end and we are given it again that we think the full year value of CapEx should be in $170 million. The CapEx that you saw in Q1 was a little higher, not unexpectedly higher just really due to the kind of cadence in which the revenue or the seasonality of the revenue came into play versus the need on the CapEx. I did note too that we had some additional spend in Q1 related to some prepaid. So we prepaid for some CapEx on a large public deal, so we can get it out of discount, which should further help our margin expansion efforts. And we would expect again with the full year being at the 170 range and our total CapEx to be between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenue.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
RH,Q4,2020,"That's great. Thank you, Gary. And a model in question for Jack just as we think about rising raw material prices and freight prices that many in the industry are seeing. Could you give us any sense of how we might think about that impacting the model? Obviously you all have pricing power, you've demonstrated that but does that have any impact on how we should be thinking about the models here?","Let me just jump in for a second. Again, I'd point you to the fundamental point that our goods are a lot more expensive, right? So as a percentage of our sales those factors are going to be a lot less, right? So start with we sell a cloud sofa $10,000 to $12,000 - $10,000 to $14,000. The freight on a $10,000 to $14,000 sofa is a lot lower than the freight on a $2,000 sofa as a percent as a percent to sales, right? So you got to start with - will we be impacted? Sure. Will it be to a much smaller degree than if you’re CB2 or to or West Dalmar something like that or Pottery Barn or Crate & Barrel or places like that, yes, like you have to look at the price structure of the goods that - again, if we’re using about the same amount of wood but ours product is just designed much better and it's a higher quality product and yes, it's going to be a smaller percentage.

And thinking kind of with an eye towards robotics and digital surgery as well, so we'll be thinking about, that being more meaningful going forward in other capacities outside of just ASC adoption. Thanks.","Yes, our primary focus was on the ASC, but there are a lot of hospitals that are concerned about sterilization and sterilization being sort of a constraint. And they'd like the less trays, they'd like less instrumentation they'd like less space taken up in their stockroom. So, I wouldn't say it's limited to the ASC's, but that really is out of the gates, let's say for the first six to nine months, that's our prime focus is going to be on the ASC because of their constraints on sterilization are the most acute, but I would say that there probably will be interest beyond that.

TER,Q2,2014,"That's helpful perspective. And then when I think about the short-term disruptions in the Wireless Test space versus the long-term opportunity, how do you guys frame that up in your mind? Obviously, you talked about the issues that are driving the market this year and in the back half of the year. What are you -- what in your mind has to be the long-term reward to live with the short-term volatility in that market?","Well, I think Wireless Test is going to be propelled by unit growth and complexity. And the period we're in, in the past, I would say, 2 years, last year and this year, is that the unit growth has slowed a bit for complex devices because of the sort of pushout of China LTE deployment. And people, in the meantime, in the traditional markets have been working on a lot of optimization and reuse of equipment. So what we do see is that the deployment of LTE in China will occur. It's hard to predict when the ramp starts to go vertical, but it will come. And with that will come a lot of complexity in those phones from an RF point of view and -- on the RF and from an applications processor and power management point of view. So for both the SemiTest business and the LitePoint business, we think that the China wave will be the next wave of benefit we see from the wireless space. And then what comes after that will be further enhancements with LTE Advanced and such that will continue to drive increased bandwidth and test complexity.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
AMD,Q4,2019,"That's helpful, Lisa. And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side, just with the workloads you're going after. But I'm kind of curious, you answered an earlier question saying you expect more GPUs for the data center. And I don't want you to pre-announce product, but then how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration? And just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA, how do I think about the investment there? Is this an area that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to, or how do I think about that over the next couple of years?","Yeah. So, I think that's actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center, you know, GPU market continues to be an important growth sector for us, and now, I call that over the several year horizon.
So, when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they're very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which are actually both the CPU and GPU win, and some of the optimization that we've done with that overall system. We think that there are additional opportunities like that, as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers, to optimize the machine learning frameworks.
And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond.

BJRI,Q2,2019,"That's helpful, thank you. And then just to follow-up on that, I mean, with the restaurant margin and even profit dollars coming under so much pressure, has the sales to investment hurdle rate changed in order to justify a compelling return?","Not really. I understand your question, Chris, and we tend to look at these really kind of at the -- at the longer-term from that standpoint. There's going to be inflation that comes up and then there's going to be times when it starts to modify and come down. If we had to look at our business ten years ago, we were spending at that time, $5 million to build a restaurant. And then through some value engineering and other things that made sense for us, we brought it down to $4 million. I think ultimately when we look at our business and we think about the fact that we're doing, in this quarter, $116,000 weekly sales average out of our eight new restaurants that you're looking at, somewhere in the neighborhood of close to $6 million AUV's. I think you tend to bring in a really great strong cash flow that still tends to be the place where we would want to invest our money and build our restaurants.We just come to the fact that we've always been this way, that we're going to build quality over quantity. We're going to make sure we can do it with high quality as well which means making sure that we have the right team members in place. So, I don't think there's any necessarily change in our view in regards to hurdle rates for investing in the new restaurants and so forth, because we still think it's the best place to invest BJ's money. But we're going to do it at quality over quantity. We've never been on an investor call saying that we're going to close 20 out of the last 40 or 50 restaurants we've opened; something we're very prideful on the fact that we go out and select great place, great locations, and execute them well.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And how do you want investors to think about the kind of investment that it might take to be competitive in that market? Thanks for taking the question.","Yes, no problem. Just want to make sure that was clear. I would say there's really no need for us to be in general surgery, robotics. As you can see, we're running a very good business at Stryker. It is a big market that has big growth potential, but it's something that like other adjacencies that are attracted to us be it areas I've spoken about in the past, like neuromodulation, or peripheral vascular, this is in an attractive adjacency. A pathway forward is not obvious and not clear at this time, but something we'll continue to look at, but it's not something we have to be in.

SWN,Q3,2012,"That's helpful. And then a couple of questions on the Marcellus. I think you highlighted the backlog or the wells that are uncompleted in your release. Can you just talk to a couple things? One, it really looks like your Ewertz are at or above the 10 Bcf-type group. Would you agree with that? And does that translate into bookings when it comes to the end of this year? And then second, how do you expect to meet the – to get up to the 300 million a day? Do your existing wells have a lot of additional production potential, or does some of that backlog come on to meet the Midstream constraints at East?","Our expectations on wells are meeting or exceeding what we thought they would be. So we have no change really in that. It's looking very good so far. The majority of our production obviously comes out of the Greenzweig area, and so we've seen some very solid, strong performance in that area. That will translate through to reserves bookings. The bigger feature is the commencement of production out of the range area. The Bluestone pipeline is well under construction. We expect to have that pipeline in service and operating around the end of November. There was no setback except for just days waiting for rain to stop. We didn't lose any forward progress on that from the storm. So we expect to get that on, and once we can get some production history associated with those wells, we will be able to move forward. We are seeing an improvement from compression out of the Greenzweig area, about 25 million to 30 million a day. That, combined with some wells waiting to be completed this quarter and the startup of the Bluestone and the Lycoming area of production also around the end of November, is the formula for getting us to 300 million a day out of -- exit rate out of Marcellus in total. Let me add some to that. Our puds that we booked this last year in the Marcellus were about 7.5 Bcf puds. Those were all in the Bradford area, I think what we call the Greenzweig area. I expect that we will see some puds revisions on those. When you start looking at that range area that we just now are beginning to hook wells up into, a lot of what you can book depends on what you see in those wells. So what could happen to us at year end, we may not get as many puds booked as you would normally expect us because we haven't seen much production from the range area. But I fully expect from all the tests that we've seen, that will be a good area and that will grow as we go out onto the future.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

How focused are you on that, do you manage to it, and how high can it go, maybe a little context here will be helpful?","Hi, Kevin. It's Carl. As a distributor, conversion ratio is a metric that we look at monthly if not more frequently. And how much of the gross profits are pulled out to EBITDA. And 32-ish% is I would say okay, but we should -- and it moves around quarter by quarter. But on an annual basis, we see ourselves creeping up to 34%, 35%, 36%. If you look at industrial distributors, you will see those kinds of conversion ratios as pretty much at the mean. The only thing I'll add to that is the added benefit of e-commerce and digitization that we're brining into our portfolio as we reduce backroom [ph] cost and cost of transaction, and that can help elevate that conversion ratio even higher, but that's yet -- like a prediction on that yet, but that's another dynamic in the equation.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

So that's why you won't see necessarily that same sequential improvement that we're seeing in some of the other businesses. With regards to bone cement, of course that's an area that has been declining, was certainly impacted by the pandemic and so we'll be a detractor as we think about that overall category.

Are you seeing a little bit more competitive pressure and is FX impacting anything?","It's been good. We actually put our price increase in place a month earlier than we normally do. We normally target February 1 in China. We moved it to the end of December. As you might recall, we had a really nice finish to the year. Some of that, again, was driven by the fact that our distributors there are little bit more proactive in ordering ahead of the price change than they are in the rest of the world. So on retrospect, we probably pulled a few million dollars worth of business into December that normally we would get in January.

RH,Q4,2020,That's helpful. My follow-up question is I guess we're all trying to figure out what sustainable demand is and when will we know what sustainable demand is. So can you replay the clock or the calendar for it last year and this year February demand I would assume that was core demand and it’s like 73% --,"February last year was up 8%, yes, February last year was 8%, up 8%. March, March, the store is - March, yes. So February last year was 8%, we told everybody it was up 8%, I think before the world fell apart. And so February is up 8% and it was kind of like right where we thought it should be. And we're up 73% in the core business on top of 8% last year. In the first two weeks of March, I think we were up 4% for one week and down 3% the other week. So we were kind of flat or up 1% in those two weeks, so against the flat first two weeks of March, we're up 96%, okay? So the way to think about it if you said, okay, if you've neutralized the 8% on February, you'd add 8 points to the 73%, you'd be up 81% and 96%. And so if you want to kind of stabilize the two months. And so they were up against all the closed galleries and closed restaurants and closed outlets. And remember, our outlet business, when it closed, it doesn't have a website. So we went to zero on the outlet, we went to zero on the restaurants and in our core business, RH core business and in our contract business, we could still take orders and stuff. Obviously the contract business, the longer we got into the pandemic and people realized that hotels and everything we're going to be closed for a long time, that business really took a hit and then our outlet business for a period time went to zero and the restaurant, right, went into zero. So big - think about big pickups in a restaurant business year-over-year, big pickup by in our outlet business year-over-year and a big pickup in our contract business year-over-year because the hospitality is now starting to spend again like they're now betting for the comeback cycle, right?

I think we talked about in the prepared remarks. On the top line, we had about a 2 point impact, so you can right-away say there is a drop through that 2 point into profitability.
But then if you take a look at the net of costs for COVID, so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had early in the year and you net them against the DME optimization, the media optimization that we did, as w ell as the T&E savings, it was a net slightly positive on those two pieces.

It is rounding the two-year mark on Wright Medical. However, we're only nine months into sort of the cash flow impact of buying Wright Medical. And so, as we announced at the time of the acquisition, we were going to focus on debt reduction and sort of tuck-in kind of M&A. And so that really is what we've been doing and you've seen it over the last nine months, we've paid down just, a little over $1 billion of debt this year.

We'll continue to look for opportunity to do that as we move forward. But we're ahead of the schedule that we thought we'd be on for debt paydown, so that's good.

GERN,Q3,2012,"That's part of the question, yes. And is it -- does every patient get measured?","Well, okay. So firstly, when we started the study, we did pre-specify in the protocol that we would be looking at outcome by pre-study tumor telomere length, but we did not mandate that every patient who wished to enroll in the study submit a tumor sample. So it turns out as is traditional for these types of studies that just over half of the patients in the lung cancer study had tissue for evaluation and around 2/3 of the breast cancer patients had tissue for evaluation. So that's the first sort of cut of the data. The second thing is the method by which telomere length is traditionally measured. We were the first people to turn that assay into something that could be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Plenty of people have measured telomere length by a variety of techniques. But we actually turned the -- we set up a PCR-based assay that can measure it on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue and again we presented that at the AACR earlier this year. The assay, as a research-grade assay, is reasonably robust. The coefficient of variation for the measurement of any individual patient's telomere length is probably 10% to 15% in either direction. And of course, that will result, for any given cut-off of telomere length, will result in a misclassification of 10% to 15% of the patients, but we will finish up the analyses and we'll be presenting the data at a scientific meeting probably sometime next year.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

We just provided an initial guidance for 2021. It's probably $50 million to $60 million higher than the current consensus. And so we are continuing to bump up our expectations.

I would say Japan has been an example of us seizing a business opportunity that presented itself in an optimal manner. And a price skirmish in Spain, also, well, that's part of business. What can you do? I wouldn't call this one a one-off. This is just part of the business on the good and on the bad side. Now really, going to Japan in more detail, well, we can -- let's try to quantify a little bit what is the year-to-date benefit of us seizing this business opportunity. I think the fairest way of doing that is that you take our year-to-date shipment share. That is about 31.5%. Our going-in share prior to the events was about 25%. That's a rounded share gain of 6.5%. On a total market of $144 billion, that gives you roughly $9.5 billion in volumes. You apply the very decent margins that you estimate for the Japanese market. You deduct from that substantial air freight cost that was well above $100 million. You deduct from there other cost and investments. We are right now at a very competitive situation in the fourth quarter. And we, of course, do everything that we need to do to support our brands.

But everything we're seeing to this point is very, very positive. I think we made the point earlier what PowerUp Rewards does is allow us to go inside and see what consumers are doing. It would be -- obviously, it would be a mistake to take the number of PowerUp members and literally multiply it by the percentage. But when -- anytime you're seeing a base of 25 million, 26 million people and you're seeing a very, very high percentage, 2/3 have been indicating very positive purchase interest, what it says to us is that the demand is very strong, and it's going to take a long time for the supply to catch up with that demand. So I think everything we're seeing suggests very, very strong demand not only now but for a very long period of time. Keep in mind that 26 million people in the program, a lot of those people are not just core gamers, right? We have a very, very broad segment of the population in there. And then I think another point that Tony mentioned earlier is value. One of the things that we think is going to be a big deal is our ability to make the systems through our trade programs affordable for millions of people who couldn't otherwise afford them.

I think about it as an investment into the outdoor furniture and special order business. So it’s architected for those two businesses, design for those two businesses, and building to leverage those two business and run them in a more focused way to kind of get better customer experience, grow those businesses, and services business is better. So before we just had a full DC in Southern California with kind of redundant DCs in Northern and Southern California, yes.

So every major container ship that's coming in is first stopping in Southern California and then going up to Oakland - the port of Oakland. So you pick up seven days immediately right there and then just the way we're going to handle and process thought crosstalk businesses, this is speed to the consumer and then if you think about the outdoor furniture business Southern California is our largest outdoor furniture market by far. And then the southern states are a lot of our strongest very, very logical. So the ability to get the goods delivers faster in the biggest markets and hit the southern states faster and think about the trucking lines and our businesses - the reason we can do this not everybody can do this is our businesses are really big, right? I think these are - like, our outdoor furniture businesses are real businesses - I mean I think our outdoor furniture business is bigger than some of our biggest competitors today at the high end, right? I think some of the - by far but they’re just outdoor against their entire business. That’s it. Like, we’re having an internal conversation here. I think about, like - you might think about, like, a higher quality national brand or something like that. So it’s a real business, right? That’s the great thing about starting to have scale like this. You can - it allow you to kind of segment and focus on businesses in a very unique way and optimize businesses like you only ran that business.

I appreciate the question. The benefit in the second half and particularly in the third quarter relative to the other segment will not be as great as it was in the first half. And it's for the reason you mentioned, which was in our prepared remarks, about the systems project and related investments at La Senza. It also, frankly, relates to some of what we are anniversary-ing in the first half of the year. As an example, the pre-opening costs and rents related to Victoria's Secret U.K., we are anniversary-ing it now as we enter the fall.

EXPE,Q2,2021,"The second question has to do with brands, and you still have the staple of brands, can you talk about different strengths in different regions and you talk a little bit about Vrbo. What about some of the other brands? And would you call out once that you think we're doing in this environment, are doing particularly well, and those that seem most challenged from a -- just comment on the business, just from a brand perspective, and the brands other than Vrbo?
","Sure. I think broadly the brands are acting within a range, I would say, of performance. But we have seen as I've mentioned, I think before, opportunities, for example, in Australia where our local brand and our local VR brand have performed very well because they had a domestic travel bias in their market, and therefore, in a world where there was much more domestic travel, we leaned into those brands relative to lean into. Let's say, Expedia brand, which has more international appeal. or an international travel fuel. So, we've seen regional moves like that. I think broadly though -- and you see some reactions and we believe hotels.com has a slightly higher percentage of unmanaged corporate travel within it. And, of course, corporate travel has been greatly reduced during COVID. So, we've seen some movements like that, but I would say, broadly, the brands have performed within the range of one other. We are doing a lot of work to figure out long-term how we want the brands to work together as a family of brands rather than as competitors. I've mentioned some of that within Performance Marketing, but I think you'll see that broadly across the enterprise. As Jon and the team get to rationalizing how those -- how we can make those brands all additive to one another as opposed to competitive. And we are continuing to market. Again, in fairly aggressively behind the brand spend. And my comment about the volatility in performance marketing is just to say there continues to be a lot of risk in getting over your performance marketing because of the volatility in cancelation rates, shutdowns, others things. So, on balance, we are slightly more biased towards brand building. And yes, this is a time where we feel, for the reason as I said, that travel is going -- when it can rebound fully, it is going to be extremely robust. And this is not a time where we want to be quiet in the market, so we are doing lots of things including our recent moves to support UNICEF, etc., to get in line with our customer base, get them invested in our brands and the relationship, and drive that for when the future comes pulling in.

And if lumber prices were sitting where they're at today, next year how much of a potential tailwind could you see to working cap from the lower commodity prices?","It's a good question. I think that maybe the best way to characterize it is that at the peak we were seeing pretty substantial increases in both accounts receivable and inventories from the impact of inflation. I think that when we were looking at it in the third quarter, it was still probably $100 million to $150 million range of headwind that we were still burning through. We think we'll burn off a good chunk of that by year-end, sort of in line with the way that we generally would pull down accounts receivable and inventory.

I think in the case of Nash Finch there just has not been that amount of capital redeployed into the stores over the course of the past decade and so we need to catch up. Some of the stores are just not going to fit and we outlined having store closings in fiscal ’15. Some of the merchandising I would say probably was not as robust as we would have seen in the historical Spartan legacy but that isn’t to say that everything is broke. I think they’ve got a great private brand program in place and that private brand business continues to perform well. It over indexes the national average. It’s a little bit softer than the Spartan numbers. We think there’s opportunities there with regard to the fresh parameter where Spartan has put a lot of emphasis on produce and meat private brand items. We think we can get some low hanging fruit there as we move forward. Many of the stores haven’t been remerchandised in a while. We think we’ll get benefits from reflows and remerchandising. The Dickinson and Fargo markets that we talked about earlier were getting very nice top line sales increases as we’ve remodeled and rebranded those stores. I don’t think there are a ton of quick hits. There are some that we’ll get but it’s really more blocking and tackling, and I think we have the right team to do it and we’re anxious to make some real progress this year.",2.0,0.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
POWL,Q4,2008,"Then my followup relates to the sequential bookings decline. Should we take that to indicate maybe a slowing in demand from the oil and gas sector, realizing your quote activity is still good? Or is this kind of just quartertoquarter lumpiness?","As we have talked about, we do have a lot of quartertoquarter lumpiness, especially with some of the size of the projects that we have. I think we would be remiss to say that there are not some issues as it relates to the timing of jobs going forward in the future. We do believe that our order input in the fourth quarter was impacted by the hurricane because not only were we down, but our customers were down and not placing orders at the same time. As I think right now, we can probably say that our first quarter order input will exceed our fourth quarter order input.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,0.0,2.0

I'm curious, does that include extra ad revenue in there as well? Or that can't be all just editorial, I assume, right?","First of all, those 70 pages include both USA TODAY content, as well as additional local content. A lot of it is content, but there is some advertising. So for instance, for a USA TODAY advertiser now has an opportunity to be across a wider swath of consumers by being in that section.

We’ve already begun to see some benefits of that and part of that is just in the way we go to market as we talk to our customers in the space which, as you know, are the really the CPGs.

Those projects are ones that have been on the docket and looked at and once they potentially have federal funding, I think what we tried to address in our comments, is the overwhelming push by the public to say we want mass transit and we want you, government, to fund this, state governments to go fund this. I think, again, what I believe is the strength that we see over the fiveyear horizon says we're going to get our good fair share of that business because people really want to see funding done for mass transit projects.

So it shows effect of the inventory step-up a 1 point margin, $3 million in operating earnings. That, of course goes, away. That gave you some guidance on the incremental investment in regional and product growth initiatives and the fact that they will continue, but should be a smaller trend. The unallocated corporate expense pain stays with us. And we're expecting the volume effect on the expense leverage to get smaller. In other words profit from the growth volume increasing and negative leverage expense of it. 2 points.

Is there anything different about this cycle or anything you can say about what we should expect for pre-owned growth as we look into 2014 and '15?","Sure, I think, yes, we've talked about this before. If you go back and look at the last several -- if you look at the last several launches, we had a situation where, obviously, as the consumers trade in to the new console, they're trading in their old games. And so we do see -- I don't know if we see cyclicality and margin rates, but we certainly see cyclicality in terms of demand. And so what we would be expecting is a fairly large quantity of consoles and games flowing in as consumers trade up to new, and we think that provides a great opportunity for us to offer a great value for new consumers. As Paul mentioned earlier, we're trading up to a 360 or to a PS3. So although we -- I don't think we've given out any sort of specific numbers, we certainly feel very optimistic about the opportunity to draw more consumers into the category with preowned.

The reduction we did was approximately 50 people across the company, and what we try to do is to make sure that we kept our focus and resources on the growth opportunity, but allowed us to lower the breakeven point and to get the cost structure down little bit lower as we see that revenues are not coming in as strongly as we had expected.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0
TER,Q2,2014,"This is Farhan Ahmad asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is regarding your Wireless Test.

So I was just wondering, like, what's led to, like, somewhat of weaker orders this quarter and if there is some share loss at the biggest customer in the Wireless Test.","I'll take that one. In my remarks, I believe I mentioned one of the factors affecting us was there was test capacity left over from the prior year that's being absorbed. So I think that's affecting us this year. And just to step back, in the last 2 years, there have been very high buying from LitePoint and Wireless Test. I think those last 2 years were above the trend line. I think we're below our trend line now, and this is not uncommon in tests, where there's some buying, it gets optimized, it gets better used with experience and know-how and then that pushes out future capital purchases. So that's what we believe is going on this year. And at some point, that capacity is absorbed and we're back delivering new testers. In terms of market share, we feel confident that -- overall, that we will gain market share yet again this year. It might be a couple of points. Now we accept market share is -- unlike SemiTest, where there's third-party reporting, it's more difficult.

NMRX,Q3,2013,"This is Matt Ramsay on for Mike. A couple of questions from us. When you step back and look at the business and the investments that you've made, it sounds like the managed services deals should ramp ARPU over the next year or so. How would you characterize sort of the size of those opportunities in aggregate that we should see over the next 12 months or so? Obviously your sub base now is going to be approaching 2.5 million. What kept the sub base to look like, say, 12, 18 months from now from a percentage of the subs that are sort of the traditional ones that you've had up until now versus these managed services deals that could be materially higher ARPU?","Well, the -- we'll give our guidance for next year in our February call following the end of the year. But we expect that the ramp in these high ARPU subscription will be a significant contributor next year. Keeping in mind that if you look at our average, and it's about $2, many of these solutions carry ARPU with them several times that average. So we think it'll have a very meaningful impact on the recurring revenue that comes from our subscription base. So we expect to continue growing our base at a robust pace, and we'll also give some visibility into the dichotomy between the traditional horizontal platform business and the -- these solutions. So -- but we're still computing, so we'll figure out the guidance that we'll provide next year. But it looks very positive right now.

So you can do the math on the individual quarterly, we won't disclose separately but it's roughly... it's pretty estimatable.

One comment that it struck me was that you were surprised by from your research at the elasticity that you thought was associated with the price of the device. Can you update me on your thinking or what you have learned about iPhone elasticity, now a quarter or later?","Well, yes, we had a very good quarter in the March quarter. With actually a very small sequential declines for holiday quarter which was far above what our expectations were, so we’re very pleased with how we did. We also announced 3.0 or previewed it developers so that they could begin to change their apps, introduce more apps for the phone, which we believe increases the ecosystem and increases the number of people that want and will buy phone it’s even more.

RRD,Q4,2012,"Tom, if you could, let's talk a little bit about the cost reduction efforts going into this year. And obviously, in the past few years or so, you've taken a significant amount of cost out, but a lot of that was driven by some fairly large acquisitions. Now absent those acquisitions, what gives you confidence you can find additional costs to take out, kind of offsetting those revenue declines?","Charlie, fair question. Let me go back a little bit to give you sort of a foundation from which -- why we think we can still do what we've continued to do since we've gotten here in 2004. There's a number of reasons to be optimistic about 2013. The U.S. economy's recovery seems to be getting stronger. The overall financial health of corporates continues to stabilize. There's a little bit more certainty in D.C. The housing market recovery is continuing. There's a low interest rate environment, and funds our available. Banks are lending. And the energy sector seems to be improving. But for us, the most optimistic reason for '13 is our plan and how we're continuing to transform RR Donnelley. We're selling more of the products and services in our portfolio to our customers, but we also are creating sound solutions to our customers that draw in more of the products and services in our portfolio. Along this communications management supply chain, there's content origination, content management and content delivery. We play a role in content origination with the capabilities that Helium brings to the platform, and we excel at content management and content delivery. We have the capabilities, credibility and capacity to be the primary player in the communication management services chain. We are continuing to go to market, as I said, to be multifaceted with the approach that we talked about, the 4 approach. We're focused on selling individual products and services across all verticals. We're leveraging the existing RR Donnelley platform to provide bundled solutions for current customers and prospects. We're delivering integrated solutions to target industry verticals, and the supply chain management opportunities that we talked about, I don't want anybody to lose focus on that. For both our existing and as well as new prospects, we will compete with external market players. We have grown the supply chain management significantly since the year-end 2010. Existing players in this area are facing challenges with the current business model, so there's a lot of opportunities there for us. All of this leads us to not to be solely dependent upon our long-run print products and gives us the ability to assist customers in their communication needs while we're lowering their overall cost and improving their customers' return on the spend. No question some long-run products are eroding, but at the same time, Charlie, these products and services, they're not going to go away. And we are participating in some of the things that we talked about that are asset-light. That wasn't the case a couple of years ago. What I talked about on the supply chain management side, what we're doing, those electronic devices didn't exist a couple of years ago. And we're doing about $0.5 billion in that area. So I think the long-run products are eroding, but they're not going away. That's going to help us. From an overall platform cost standpoint, what does this mean? We still have the ability to match costs to revenues. The transformation evolution of the business allows us to continue to take out costs to match revenues. What's interesting for me to see in the marketplace when other customers -- I'm sorry, other companies are talking about their cost-saving targets that they've achieved, they have achieved those targets, but they've seen those costs eaten up by a decline in their base business. Our platform is far from reaching that point, so I want to make sure that's emphasized today, that we've still got the ability to match costs to revenues in this platform as we continue to evolve.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And we'll put the 2 wells that Bill talked about on production this month. We'll have, by January, 2.5 months of production on those or 2-plus months of production. And when we add that to the testing we had earlier, we'll be able to figure the shape of those curves. The other thing we've already talked about, you want to contact as much of the rock as you can, and you're going to have to have vertical height on your fracs because you're looking at 350 foot to 400 foot interval. And frankly, on our first well, we got about 25 foot to 30 foot height growth. And even in this most recent one I talk about, we're looking about 90 foot to 100 foot growth. So we still need to do some things in the frac-ing side to get across more of the zone and contact more of the reservoir. So we'll continue to work on the frac-ing. Whatever we learn in this horizontal we're doing now, we'll apply that and go out in the future. So those are the 2 main things there. As far as cost, rather than go into the various costs in each well, we do something internally where -- we call it the pacesetter. We take the wells that we've drilled and whatever the best piece of that well was, whether it’s the vertical part up whole, or whether it's the horizontal, or building the curve, and we put that together and say we know we can do that. And all we have to do is do it consistently and here's what’s going to be. And then from there, we improve and we go from there. On a pacesetter well, let me just put it on days to drill, this most recent well, Doles well, took us about 55 days to drill a pacesetter well. Like I said, one where we just did everything the way we've done and had success in the past on each of individual portion would be about a 35-day well for that same well. And when you start talking about a 35- to 40-day well, going back to my comments on the second quarter conference call, you're talking about $10 million to $12 million-type wells. The well we're on today on the Doles is above $12 million, but it's not significantly above $12 million. So we're in the range, and we can see a way to get our costs down. Let me also add, on the economic side, historically, we've talked about the fact that we needed a certain rate and we threw out any gas. We didn't worry about any of those kinds of things. But if we can do a $12 million well -- to reach our 1.3 PVI, that's our economic hurdle, we need about 425 barrels a day of oil and about 4.2 million a day of gas when you count that in. That's $80 oil LLS price, and it is a little over $3 NYMEX price. And you put the BTUs on that and the oil, and that's the economics for that.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

GCI,Q3,2013,"Two questions for you. Just first, did your businesses see any impact from the government shutdown, meaning exiting 3Q or 4Q to date?","I can say that there's been direct impact, and then there's probably the more indirect impact. For instance, we have a little business called Gannett Government Media. Obviously, that had a pretty chilling effect on that business. We own a television station here in Washington D.C. As you can appreciate, it serves the Northern Virginia, D.C. and Maryland areas. And those, I believe, were the states most impacted directly by the slowdown. As for a more global impact across our company, I've read a lot of pundits who have indicated that this is going to have some meaningful impact on the economy over the next period of time. We'll just going to see how that plays out. I think the important thing is going to be whether we just simply kick the can down the road and, therefore, we start up with the uncertainty again that causes businesses and consumers to be a bit chilled by what they see going on here in Washington D.C., or whether this can be a much more collaborative outcome that this company -- country I believe so richly deserves.

But Egencia with essentially flat compares on a sequential basis, could you just provide an update on what's going on there? And my second question relates to the M&A that's been occurring in Europe on the OTA front, and obviously, there's been considerable speculations. Can you talk about whether or not you think you would potentially have an interest in participating? And do what you think of the path [ph] you'll make in that regard?","Yes. So on Egencia, we continue to be pretty pleased with its growth, and it really is kind of across-the-board, different segments in the market, geographically dispersed as well. We are seeing much faster growth rates than we think the industry is experiencing. We grew 40-plus percent gross bookings, and AMEX, I believe, grew about 20%. And so we feel like we are taking share. The comp does start to get a little bit more difficult based upon when corporate travel started to return a bit. For us though, I think what's most positive is that we're seeing the increase in same client spending as well as a lot of the new business that we signed during the recession and then continuing on with new business today. So I think our value proposition continues to resonate very well.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

Could you give us some sense about what kind of conversion and return on investment you were seeing from those increased spending? And secondly, Dara, I think you talked about 43% of the bookings are merchant. Can you give us some sense like what percent of your hotel booking is merchant versus agency and how that trend is trending?","On the merchant bookings question, so the vast majority of our Hotel business remains merchant. That 10% to 15% is agency. As between Expedia and hotels.com, hotels.com does have a higher agency penetration. And the agency hotel business is growing, and we are working, as Dara indicated earlier, to really deliver more demand to the growing number of EDM [ph] hotels that we have.

And secondly, Dara, I think you talked about 43% of the bookings are merchant. Can you give us some sense like what percent of your hotel booking is merchant versus agency and how that trend is trending?","Sure. As far as on the keyword pricing, et cetera, I'll answer that, and then Mike can talk about merchant. The 21% increase in sales and marketing wasn't necessarily all keyword pricing. But it does reflect an increase in aggression on our part in the CPC space and search engine marketing in general. Both and are being very aggressive than some of the new territories that we're going into, new markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific, where we go in with more aggressive efficiencies, so to speak. So that's not necessarily keyword pricing going up. That's just our getting into new markets, which tend to be less efficient from a marketing perspective than, call it, our more mature markets where we have more repeat users, et cetera. So I think while there is some keyword pricing in there, while we are, on balance, being more aggressive in certain markets and we do anticipate being more aggressive in the European, Asia-Pacific markets, it's a combination of our getting into new markets and our being more aggressive on the keyword pricing front. As far as ROI goes, as we get into these new markets, as we increase our spend, our ROI is lower than, call it, the mainline spend that we have in place now. So my expectation will be that for a couple of quarters as we spend up, our CPC ROI will go down, and then what we do is we spend time optimizing the ROI there, understanding which keywords work, understanding which keywords don't, optimizing our landing pages, the presentation to the customer, which usually gets us some efficiency back. But right now, we're in a mode of spending up. You see it in our sales and marketing numbers but also, again, it's something that we manage and you see it in our revenue numbers and gross bookings numbers, which are quite healthy.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
FISV,Q4,2010,"Two quick questions. One is, can you tell us just more specifically about the very nice margin expansion that you saw in the Financial segment? You detailed a little bit, but I wanted to make sure that I understood exactly all the moving parts on that. And going forward, you called out a few things that will help continue with that cost savings and things like that. But will the thing that happened in the fourth quarter repeat itself?","The other thing I would add in there, Brett, is for the last couple of years, at least we've been trying to -- especially as revenue growth was hit so hard by the economy, we've been trying to point people to the fact that in places where we've been losing revenues, so take item processing for an example, we are replacing that revenue with much higher quality, much more attractive margin characteristic carrying revenue. And so we talked about some of the drag that we're going to have this year on our organic growth rate. We're still going to grow in a range of 2% to 4%, but we're going to replace all that revenue. And the IP side of that revenue is very low margin revenue. We'll replace that with much higher margin revenue. We've been doing that for a number of years, and that will continue. As that low margin revenue bleeds off, we will replace that and are replacing with typically recurring revenue that has pretty attractive incremental margins. And that's a big driver. Probably the single largest driver of the 650 basis point gain that we've had over the last four years is the swapping out of lower margin revenue for higher margin revenue, and we will continue to do that. Whether it came via the CheckFree acquisition or whether it's come from just internal revenue growth or swapping of revenue, you will continue to see that for a long period of time.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And going forward, you called out a few things that will help continue with that cost savings and things like that. But will the thing that happened in the fourth quarter repeat itself?","Well, I think we don't -- the fourth quarter, let me just talk about the quarter for a moment. We did have a lot of good growth there from a top line. If you compare it to the third quarter right, revenues were up in that particular segment, about $20 million. Most of that dropped to the bottom line. Typically, in the fourth quarter, Brett, we do have some good purchasing from clients as far as license revenue goes compared to the third quarter. So when you compare the Q4 to Q3, we just had a lot of good incremental drop through in that particular quarter because, really, our license revenue in that particular segment was up on a sequential basis. And we had a really solid quarter from that standpoint as far as that drop through goes. And in comparison to the quarter four of last year, again, good mix of revenue. But also, we have some discretionary compensation expenses last year, which did not recur in the current year, which helped that year-over-year comparison. But I think going forward, we look at margins, sometimes these licensees will fall into the fourth quarter, sometimes into the third, sometimes into the second. But overall, we're going to continue to grow our margins in both of our segments. We continue to have a number of opportunities, and we continue to have more outsourcing revenue in this segment. And we have, again, good scale businesses. We have our new $250 million target for operational effectiveness.

NAFC,Q4,2007,"Two quick questions. The first question is related to include food inflation and I was just wondering are you able to pass those cost increases along to your customers, specifically wondering about the Military division?","Okay. In answering that question the answer is yes. Specifically to the Military business, the vendor is in direct control of the costs that the military pays. We really don't have any influence on that whatsoever so for us it's a matter of working off of what we refer to as grades. So from the military perspective, there is no exposure to us on inflation. Regarding our Food Distribution business, predominately that is also the case. We pass on costs because we are a distributor. We are not holding back on those increases. Having said that, we do the best job we can as a distributor to protect our customers for as long a period as we can by buying inventory before it goes up but absent that there's no impact to us from inflation because again our costs to our customers is based on what we buy it for.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

OSUR,Q3,2020,"Understood. And then I guess one for the follow-up, maybe on the antigen testing side. I understand that there'll be a push out here from Q4 to Q1. Maybe can you give us some color on what drove the push out? I guess, the question on investors' minds is what is causing the delay? Are there any technical challenges here? And as you think about that, I guess the language in the press release said that version two the at-home or self-swabbing version would follow soon after. Is that a first half event? Or I'm curious on how we should be thinking on the self-swab at-home version of the test?","Right. So we've only forecasted as you noted an EUA for our professional version of the test in the first quarter. But you may recall, Vijay from our second quarter call back in August that we indicated that even though we were going to seek sequential EUAs. So as you noted professional then prescription self-test then over-the-counter self-test, we will actually be conducting the clinical trials in parallel to shorten the time between each approval. So part of our plan remains to do so. And while we're not providing specific information about when the prescription self-test and the over-the-counter self-test would be on the market, we believe it will be soon after the professional product is approved. And so we'll leave it at that for now. But I think it's important to step back and see what's been accomplished. What's been impressive to us is the technical work that's gone to essentially validate that our -- the core of our OraQuick technology, which is a test strip effectively. It's performing exceptionally well in limited detection studies, compared to rapid antigen tests that are already on the marketplace. And so that is a significant progress for us right now. And the clinical trials that will go through between now and the EUA submission process in the first quarter, I think we are very confident we'll validate the success of the product. What we are trying to do is something that no other company has done before. And that is essentially have a one-step rapid antigen test that is essentially the same design we'll use for the professional the Rx self-test and the OTC self-test ready in design in the professional product. So no other product that's on the market today was designed specifically for that purpose even though all of them are professionally used products in their own right. So we're taking the extra care based on our experience in putting the OraQuick HIV in-home test on the market. And also by the way developing the Ebola Rapid Antigen test back in 2017 in nine months' time to get this on the market as quickly as possible. So, there are always things that are unanticipated that come along in product development, but I think we're very confident in that first quarter EUA with the Rx self-test and the OTC self-tests coming soon thereafter.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

","Well, most customers who use those products recognize the value in it and there's a lot of components to the value. Structurally, it's a better built house, less jobsite waste, increased cycle time. So you may have a few that try to shift, but I don't think the dip in commodity prices is really going to trigger that. During the depths of the downturn when framing labor costs hit rock bottom and commodity prices were down, that's where you'd seen builders more likely to re-evaluate the cost benefit.

So, the specific thing we mentioned in Atheros was something we are doing Intellon prior to Atheros acquiring them where we are showing both compatibility as well as bridging capability between MoCA and HomePlug AV, because there is maybe some places in the home where you don't have coax where you are still going to have this connected home experience, and you can use HomePlug to get to those particular sections of the home. So we demonstrated that capability. A big part of what we are showing there is HomePlus AV is really the de facto standard within the powerline space. MoCA is really de facto standard within the coax space. And G.hn is trying to come in and say, okay, we are going to do everything for everybody, kind of solve the world's hunger problem of home networking, and which is not backward compatible with anything.

So, I guess we are in the flight pattern today. The satellite business generally, seasonally strong period in Q4 and Q1, usually a little bit seasonally softer in Q2 and that would be especially the case for our run rate business at EchoStar. And the case for the DIRECTV business, we are ramping there into – from kind of the high-end HD market to all HD. So, we are going to continue to see expansion in that in Q1. Unclear exactly how that's going to look in Q2 at this point, but we also see international satellite service providers starting to deploy CSS later this year as well. So I'd say generally throughout the year that should be a growing business for us. We might see a little bit of softness in that business in Q2 though, because that is a seasonal soft quarter especially for the big tier-one guys.

Is that similar? Is it fairly slow in the beginning or do you think you already started to see some meaningful units already in the first half of the year?","Yes. I don't know if DIRECTV talks specifically about their launch plan. Typically, what they'll do is they're launching some percentage of the US with a new technology, maybe a third or half of the US and then over the next quarter, pan out to a nationwide type of a launch. So I think that business is going to continue to ramp for us throughout 2010 and possibly in the 2011. One of the things that really bodes well for the company is I think we are also seeing a really big ground swell or purchase of HDTVs which basically is the precursor to people upgrading their Pay-TV service from standard def to high def service. So most of the products we are going into really are going to benefit from consumers upgrading their service from standard def to high def service and this is with DIRECTV, this is also what Verizon, but also with the cable MSOs.

RH,Q4,2020,"We anxiously await them. The - maybe just a quick follow-up, right, given the unsolicited proposals for the residences out in Aspen. It sounds like it has you thinking right that the idea is bigger maybe not bigger than you originally thought. But curious if those proposals indicate something bigger about the opportunity maybe a quicker maturation behind it or where the mindset is on just the residences as a whole?","Yes. I don't think we've got to kind of rush here. I think we've got to kind of rush to learn and kind of conceptualize the right model. I don't think it's going to be hard for us to build beautiful homes and sell them. I think that we can do. Like what is the right model? How do you do it? Where you go like - is it is this one where we're, let's say, we decide to really, to really do this. Let's say we have some tests and we're like wow, this really works and we've also had strategic inbounds, people that want to partner with us and people that have read the Aspen press release. I've had CEOs of companies that are reaching out want to know would we want to partner and build RH homes together and do a JV. And there may be opportunities like that, right. There may be people that have what we don't have today, the ability to procure and secure land, know how to build homes at scale but don’t have our creativity, our taste, our style. Don’t have our brand so to speak. And - so there could be opportunities where you see us partner with major home brand or acquire one. I don’t know like if we get really good at it. So, there’s not - there’s lot of optionality here. I think the gist - I think the great thing I have said for years here to the team that, we're only in the 10% of the business. And sometimes people - new people say to me, what do you mean we're only in the 10% of the business? We’re in the 10% of the business on average at the high end. People spend about 10% on the furnishings of their house compared to the price of the house. So if you've got a $10 million home, you spend about a $1 million furnishing it. You spend a $5 million home, you spend on average $500,000 furnishing it, right. And that's just the math, $2 million, probably $200,000. That's generally the allocation breakdown. Not always perfect, but it's directionally right. So I've always said like we're in the 10% of the business. We don't sell the home. And we're actually handicapped being in the 10% of the business because where a lot of times furnishing a really crappy architecture home like I could bad designed home, a bad proportion home. And so, it doesn't even render our goods more valuable, right. Like all of our galleries are protected, beautifully, proportionately in a way that it renders the goods more valuable. Our - most of the homes we do - like most homes. Like you go on, again, I would say go into Zillow, go in Redfin, go in whatever what you. Like just click through and tell me how many homes really have great architecture and how many have good interior design. It's like such a small number. It's like less than 1 in a 100. It’s like less than 1%. So I love thinking about this market in that way. And like we could - whenever it’s like that - when the numbers look like that, you can create a new market, right? You can create an entirely new market. And that’s what our big idea is, not just to sell some home. It’s to create a new market at the high end for homes, that people really want an RH home because they’re just so well-designed, not furnished - like, the architecture, the logic, the sitting of the house, the landscape architecture, the pool, everything, like the whole thing is just so well-designed and then it's furnished incredibly. And so you just go, like, you just want to move in, right? Like, it's - like, we save you time. And, again, people with more money have less time. People with more time have less money, right? And what can you sell at the high end? You can sell time value. People will pay for time value. There's a lot of people on this planet that have more money than time. They've accumulated wealth and now they're at my age. You're 63. You think about how much time you have left and you look to buy time value, right? And I think that's - if you said, what are you really going to sell? We're going to sell time value, and people will pay for that.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HOME,Q4,2017,"Well Lee may be taking the flip side of that, do you think the business may be in a position where it might be able to deliver mid single-digit comps over the next couple years?"," I’d tell you, we don't plan ourselves too low single-digits in the way we focus our efforts. And that – but it doesn't always hits. Sometimes weather shows up some other things happen. I rather plan for something higher and ensure that we deliver on what we've just shared with you. So we have a lot of initiatives, adds up to something higher. I hope it hits.
Obviously you can see in years past we've actually been able to hit - numbers that are higher than that and that's helped us with – wetter weather sometimes the product acceptance was better than we had planned, not as good as we had hoped. Actually we continue to think our product is fantastic.
So I would say we gun for something higher because we put a lot of energy against it, but we never commit to anything higher than that because – you wouldn't want us to and stuff happens. And so Judd talked about the weather this quarter for example. Hey, I'm not excited about all the rain and all the snow everybody is getting is that that help patio sales? No.
We're projecting a positive same-store sales growth despite the wettest February in 120 years of recorded history in Texas, where they were four Nor'easters in five weeks and but you don't want to hear us whining about weather. You want us to continue to deliver a same-store sales growth every quarter. So we'll gun for something higher and commit to what we've had in prior year.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,0.0

Is that value increasing because of the emergence of new digital networks and services, like over the top networks, or in spite of them?","And I guess, yeah, I'm not sure, you could argue both, I think it’s like the TV and sort of go back of a value of a bundle. I mean, I could argue and I would argue today, the TV experience is a much richer one and much more rewarding one for consumers who get choice all the time in an array of things more ways to access the products, more technologies get put out there, so I think it is sort of it is a richer experience but I think equally you could end up saying it's sort of hits. As you get more choice, the hits just become more unique and more important but and I probably argue probably either.

BIO,Q4,2016,"Well, Christine, I really appreciate all the detailed color on all the puts and takes there. As we think about the operating margin outlook for this year, given that a good portion of the ERP expenses will come onto the P&L from capitalized, can you quantify what that incremental number alone is in 2017 versus 2016?","
So I think that the spending was already higher in 2016 and so incrementally as we look to 2017, and this is assuming a fairly quick stabilization period, I think the incremental spend is only a few million dollars, $3 million to $5 million.

EXPE,Q3,2010,"Well, I didn't really mean it to focus on Choice, but to focus generally and broadly if you're seeing -- and you kind of answered it -- seeing any impact from hotel companies attempting to move away from OTAs in terms of the economics.","Yes, I think the volumes speak for themselves, right? Our volumes are healthy both on a domestic and international basis. And I think that the big brands out there are doing what's smart, which is they have a diversified base. They advertise to bring direct players out there. They've got loyalty programs. They work with OTAs. They work with Google, and all of that helps them build out an occupancy base, which hopefully will allow them to build up ADRs. So I don't think that one, again, is exclusive over the other. I think a smart player builds a multichannel strategy and builds strength in every single channel that they have. If they're stronger with us, they will be able to build out their occupancy base inside their hotel and that will be able to drive premium ADRs in the industry, which is how you win. Again, we haven't seen any kind of negative trends, and our relationship with the brands are, frankly, terrific. As far as the Car business goes, we did see some increase in fleets kind of over the summer. The fleets have tightened up again. And I would say that, yes, the car companies in general, like the airline companies, are more disciplined on a capacity basis. Our Car business is growing nicely, and we want it to grow more. We're looking at opportunities to grow that business. But I would say in general, the Car business for us remains healthy. And in an ideal world, we'd like to see a bit more capacity, but we are seeing to date some capacity restraint, which reflects a bit more discipline on our car vendors than at least we saw two, three years ago.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

My other question is I guess there was a little bit of chatter about the revenue multiple that you paid for $0.01 and I know they have very high margins and it’s been a very well run company. But this seems a little bit like a stretch multiple for you guys in particular. So what are we missing, is it the growth is the ability to add capacity on the back end of this, is that what we might be missing here?","I’ll just say one thing. Really good opportunities are not bargain priced, so I wouldn’t say that this was a bargain price. Cole Hamels just went for $144 million.

So I just want to get a sense of how you see the timing of the 400-gig market, if that has slid out versus your prior expectation? And if so when?","Okay. So first of all, 400-gig, we believe, is truly for our high-end enterprises, semi providers cloud, and very, very high in enterprise, quite the opposite of campus. And as we said before, we expect early 400-gig trials will be in the late 2020 time frame.And actually, material production, general availability due to low cost, lack of cost-effective 400-gig optics and even some of the COVID issues will be in 2021. Nothing has really changed there, but we continue to see that.Now we did have some exciting product announcements. In 400-gig, we introduced the Arista OSFP line card, which is really a low power, a highly compact, plugable Arista OSFP form factor for simplifying DWDM for distances up to higher than 20 kilometers.We also demonstrated interoperability with Sienna with their most dense and spectrally efficient 400-gig and Arista Switch. So our 400-gig trials definitely are continuing with existing customers and cloud titans. But as we've always said, we expect - just to put this in context for you, in Q4, the number of 400-gig ports according to market researchers is 5,000 ports.However, the 100-gig ports was several millions, so there's 1,000x magnitude difference between the two.

So I just have two questions and I'll state them upfront in the interest of time. The first question Kevin is for you. I'm just wondering how you've kind of framed your thoughts on the outlook for your hip and knee business in the back half given the rise in COVID cases that we're seeing? That's question number one. And then I would love you to comment also is question number two on the acceleration in Neurovascular, maybe just give a little more color, I mean was that market share you think, was that, was there strength in ischemic and hemorrhagic, just kind of looking for a little more color on the acceleration there? Thank you.","Sure, thank you Bob. First on the hip and knee, what we're seeing is really a gradual increase we've seen throughout the year of return of elective procedures. These are deferrable procedures that need to be done at some point. And yes, with the Delta variant we are starting to see pockets of disruption, but overall the hospitals are very capable of being able to deal with this. And we're seeing in markets like Latin America and other markets the situation is actually improving. So overall, we know there is going to be some disruption and that is baked into our guidance, but we believe with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses and we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance.

As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business we had an outstanding first quarter. It was around 27%, so this is 30%, so it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say, we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow diverting stents, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific.

The Daily's not a newspaper product. It's a news product. We're in the news business, just as Fox News is in the news but I think the [incentive] today is the launch of this. It's a news product that’s taking advantage of a new technological platforms, the tablet or the iPad and I don't think you should think about it as sort of big part of our newspaper business or as part of our television business. So it’s a, I think we have great expertise in news across an array of existing platforms and this is taking advantages of that expertise in news to create a product for this new digital world and relatively I think we should be doing that with all our brands and our content, I mean I think to me that’s the sweet spot for us in digital. I'm not going to rule out sort of finding things in the dot com world, but I think for us the digital places we bring unique strengths or when we could take our brands and our expertise and our content and figure out how do you develop digital extensions or digital experiences based on the content brands that we have and we’ve got fabulous ones around the world. And I think one of great things about these digital platforms which will get to the back is, realistically you can create them, in a whole different at a pretty modest level of investment in the whole different scale, because you don't have all the other thing that go with it, I mean you don’t have, compared to newspapers, you don’t have paper distribution returns and the rest in lot of the infrastructure that goes with all these businesses.

","All in key stuff [ph] that GPON or EPON silicon really doesn't go into the set-top box per se. It goes more into a separate product which is more of an optical network terminal or an ONU, an ONU in the case of a multiple dwelling unit or an OMT in case of a single-family unit. So, it really doesn't give them additional real estate there. Broadcom is a big player in DSL and they are already in GPON.

EXPE,Q3,2010,"When I'm thinking about the airlines, you're seeing them start, at least the U.S. airlines anyway, are focusing their growth on international markets, which makes sense. And they're kind of keeping their domestic capacity flat. When you look at your business, as far as the U.S. point-of-sale airline business, do you capture a decent chunk of the international sales relative to the domestic? Or is that a bad trade-off for you to have the airlines growing international at expense of domestic?","No, it's actually pretty balanced. We have seen with the economy struggling a reduction in U.S. to international flights and also, along with that, bookings, kind of room night bookings, from consumers in the U.S. going internationally. And part of that was because tickets going out to Europe, going out to Asia, ticket prices were very, very expensive on a year-on-year basis. The year-on-year comps seem to be easing in general because I think prices started getting a little stronger last year. So as international becomes more affordable, so to speak, we're seeing actually U.S. to international volumes improve both on the air side and the hotel side. So I'd say in general, adding capacity from airlines for us is a good thing. We're happy to see capacity coming into the system. It eases ATPs. And with easier ATP comps, so to speak, our business tends to pick up. I would say, if anything, our business tends to be a bit more internationally focused than domestically focused as far as U.S. consumers go.

We’re delighted to recognize Ann’s performance with this promotion. Our second announcement is we will be speaking at the Citi technology conference on September 4 in New York City.

Second, we’re executing our goal to grow earnings in our other businesses.

What do you see your uses of cash flow in future years?","If the company continues to grow at a fairly modest rate as it has in the past then I would imagine we would start considering dividend increases, as well as share buybacks. Right now we have some litigation going that we’re reserving some cash for. We think it’s not probable that we’ll lose, and we also have another year of healthy capital expenditures planned in the factory. So I think if the business performs over the next couple of quarters like it did in the first quarter here, we would begin to entertain a dividend increase. I think the company is from a cash standpoint in great shape, given every contingency that we know that’s out there right now. And I think this litigation would be over by the end of September. So heading into the fourth quarter of this year, we’ll have a better understanding where our cash position is and what we want to do in this fiscal year.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

We do expect that to continue for the balance of the year. We expect growth of that customer.

NAFC,Q4,2007,"When you talk about the acquisition environment out there, I know you said that there is nothing to announce right now but I've always kind of viewed that to get to that 4% EBITDA margin you'll likely have to make an acquisition in the distribution space. Are there more conversations going on or is it still very similar to how it was last year that people are looking at from the other distribution companies that are bought whether it be the performance food groups or US Food Services and just looking for too much money at this point?","I would say that I don't know that there has been a 180-degree turn. What I would say from conversations is that I think that there is a much more of a realization of the difficulty in the credit markets these days. And that you've got a lot of people that have recently made large deals so they are sitting on the sidelines and you have got others, private equity that is not able to perhaps be as active as they have been in the past.

So what I am seeing is, is that if you are a Nash Finch and you have got a strong balance sheet and strong access to capital and a solid performing business, you are probably a pretty rarity right now and you are probably a good dance partner. So I am not having as many people -- last year all I heard about was the US Food Service deal. I couldn't get past hello without hearing about the US Food Service deal and I am not having that happen. I think business people by in large are pretty astute and they see the markets and they see what's going on out there and they realize that if they need an exit strategy or they desire an exit strategy, there's not as many people out there today as there perhaps was a year ago and that's causing discussions to be a bit more reasonable.

Having said that, I want to emphasize that we don't have anything that is underway or imminent or anything that we are even close to pursuing, but we continue as we have mentioned in the past to discuss opportunities with a variety of parties that we think would make sense for both of us.",2.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0

But LitePoint would expect to operate with good profits this year, as well as the prior 2 years. Obviously also, though, we've invested much were in the distribution and in the R&D in cellular tests. This -- we see this LTE as an opportunity. It's a discontinuity. Customers are looking for different solutions. They can't buy what they bought in the past. So there is this opportunity, whether it's a 1, 2-year window. So this is when we need our best engineers, best products engineers and best sales guys out in the field. And we've done that in the past year in the major Asian countries. So we've absolutely ramped up the LitePoint OpEx.

Does the company really feel that its going need to go to the potential of 330 or is there, really the goal is possibly to file for approval after this first -- after the next look?","Okay. Well, I would just add that as Paul mentioned I think it’s, we have a certain enrollment plan. It’s been constant with the manufacturing plan both programs are designed to be in concert. So, that’s for maximum efficiency, everything sort of comes to fishing around the same time for BLA filing given that the data is along set. So, we have these various opportunities to see just where the data stands with regards to that. Certainly, the trial is sized for 330, the company is focused on the aspect of as was mentioned looking at the data, at these interim looks that is with any program I think it’s a step-by-step sort of process where you take a look at the data, you see what the opportunities are, you obtain the necessary funding to move on to the next step. And so, I’m sure that’s an aspect of things. But as Paul also mentioned we are certainly not resting on our laws with regards to be what I can say a very good enrollment especially this would be other benchmarks from other companies.

So, I think we’ll answer a lot of questions about the product in the partnering profile of the product. So, we expect to be able to make business decision based on the next set of data, clearly more money will need to be spent to develop, clinically develop the product. And the question is who is going to provide those dollars, is it going to be of shareholders, is it going to be partners?

So we have put ourselves as a point where we feel we can very much compete with whoever comes into the space at that point of time, because the typical way forward for the biosimilars is of course being to take a 20% to 30% price decrease of the whack and thereby going in and within 180 days skim the market if you will. We are taking a very different price approach because if that's what the biosimilars are going to do, then they will still be in the 30,000 when we are in the early 20,000. So as far as I'm concerned, we are in a very, very strong position going forward with the price point that we have provided on here. So all in all, we will navigate in the space, we have got the market access that we wanted, that's also a very important component of course within 9 months to have 259 million lives to be covered I think speaks for itself and that's of course a part of the pricing strategy that we set up with in the very initial phase.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

As always when you have price increases like this and you have contracts with multiple players, you have administration fees, a few things that kick in. So it's going to be a portion of that, but it’s the larger majority of it. From a pricing strategy perspective, we believe that we will continue to take price increases that are responsible to the market. We need to recall we're obviously cost -- this cost increase is from salaries to FDA fees to other things that we will continue to ensure that those are recovered of the business.

RH,Q4,2020,"Wonderful news on the momentum continuing. Gary, we've spoken before about demand creation, how it's not no longer a single number on the P&L like a percent of sales but a confluence of the investments you're making in Aspen, London, RH3, etc. It seems RH is building more of desire creation and a pipeline of future customers. So who wants the RH lifestyle, right, and everything that comes with it. So how should we think about that advertising demand creation line in and of itself going forward? Thank you very much.","It's a really good question. And so the right way to think about it. Building one of most admired brands in the world, desired brands in the world whichever adds to it you want to use really it takes a different path, it takes a different way to communicate and I think we're in a world where it's harder and harder to get your message out because there's so much information out there. I read a study and I think it's about a year ago that humans are consuming 700% - 7 times the information than they were 20 years ago and it's an astonishing number if you think about that from 20 years ago we're consuming 7 times more information because of these devices we have and the amount of information, the amount of platforms we're communicating on and the ease of communicating to us. So the way to kind of breakthrough, right? Steve Jobs said something if you watch his original kind of YouTube presentation when he's on his shorts and flip flops on a little Apple stage when he came back to Apple and he was talking about he was reintroducing to think - reintroducing Apple and introducing the think different campaign. And he said we live in a really noisy world and it's going to be really hard for anyone to remember anything about any of us and that it is so important to - that he talked about marketing and about values, right? About those things you deeply believe in and connecting with people about values and he talks about some of the great brands. He talked about Nike being one of the great brands in the world. And he said if you think about Nike they're selling a commodity, they're selling tennis shoes, right? They're selling shoes for the most part. And he said - but yet in their advertising they don't talk about the shoe. They don't talk about the sole. They don't talk about the laces. They don't talk about - they talk - they celebrate great athletes and great athletics, right? And he talked about Apple believed that they could - that people - that they're passionate enough really could change the world. And that in that Apple brand, the Think Different campaign, it was also a campaign that was more than anything else is about the absence of the product, right? You didn't see an iMac. You didn't see anything in the campaign. You don't really - think about Nike. It hasn't built their brand based on any particular shoe. We all remember the Jordan shoe. But why do we remember that Jordan shoe? Because of Michael Jordan, not the specific shoe, right? So if you think about the great brands and you think about how they built them and how they communicated, they - it's very unique path. Think about this. The standout. Tesla is the fastest growing most valuable car company in the world. They've never had a TV commercial. Think about that. People line up for Teslas, right? So we say inside our company, like, for example, we don't have a marketing department, and that may shock a lot of people. We don't have a marketing department because marketing a lot us about putting lipstick on a pig, right? It's like taking an average idea and trying to dress it up and spin it and make it something better than average. That's really hard to do, right? It's just really hard to do. And we don't have a marketing department we say it's not what we say, it's what we do that defines us, right? So we have a truth group and our truth group, in the past, they'd come to me and say someone wants to write a story about this and they're going to put us in that story and go well, that's not what we believe. Like why would we want to be in that story? It's not our truth. And so our work is our truth. And we define ourselves through our work. And we connect with people through our work. And that's why launching kind of a fully integrated revolutionary ecosystem in a place like Aspen where the wealthy and affluent vacation - visit and vacation and doing something extraordinary there, you've got it - you've got the attention of the right people. And we're not going to bang pots and pans and say look at us, we're going to do some extraordinary work. That's why I say when climbing the luxury mountain and taking the path we've taken, all the luxury brands were born at the top of the mountain, right? Like you think about any luxury brands, they're all born at the top of the mountain. We weren't born there. We were - we weren't in born at the bottom of the mountain, right, we were born underground. We're basically a bankrupt company. So we had to kind of dig ourselves from out from under the ground and then decide like we're going to make a climb that no brand has ever made. No one's ever tried to make this climb. And so we're - and people on the top of the mountain, they don't really want you to make that climb. You're not from the neighborhood, you don't get invited to their parties. And so you have to got to do work that is so extraordinary, so remarkable, so amazing that it creates a forced reconsideration of our brand, that it forces people at the top of the mountain to tip their hat, right? To kind of say nice job. We have to earn their respect. So there's a famous quote that says, when you don't come from royalty, you have to earn it, right? And so this work that we're doing, the things that we're doing to build this brand we believe is the right kind of work. We believe if we do extraordinary work that breaks through the clutter, people are going to talk about it. And by the way, we put out a press release, a single page press release talking about Aspen. And I don't think I've ever had more billionaires reach out to me and send me notes and say what are you doing in Aspen? Like I personally had three requests to buy one of their homes. Our partner has had about 12 requests. Nobody's even seen a home. We even didn't put a rendering out. So when you think about that, it's like, we are about - we're about spaces. We're about design and architecture and living, spaces and places. And that's what we're about. And so, doing incredible spaces, creating inspiring environments, we believe will break through the clutter. And it's way more powerful than just doing it at and trying to talk about. That's why we don't have social media. That's why we don't have an Instagram account. We don't have a Twitter. We don't do this. Everybody has told me, you need to tweet. You need to you need Pinterest, Pinterest account. You need to have an Instagram account. People will follow you guys. Gary, if you tweet, you'll have all of these followers. I'm like, I don't want to spend my time thinking about what to tweet tomorrow. So, I don't want to spend my time, I don't want to have a department that's reviewing what pictures to put on Instagram that day. And by the way, just as a point of reference, we don't have a Pinterest, a Twitter and Instagram, yet we're the most pinned brand of our kind in the world. We're the most tweeted about brand of our kind in the world and we're the most Instagram brand of our kind in the world. And so like that's why we believe it's about our work and that's why we're doing the things we're doing and by the way by doing the good things we're doing like even building and aspiring galleries we're building, we're now looking at the model and we're saying in these galleries and especially the ones with the restaurants, right, that are driving significant traffic. We don't believe we need to spend as much money mailing catalogs in that market because with thousands of people we feed every week. And so when you think about our financial model and opportunities and leverage in investment just because we used to invest a certain way doesn't mean we should keep investing that way because we're - as we continue to innovate we can see around more corners, we have more data, we have more learnings and I sit here today and I go like gosh, we haven't mail the source looking how long. A year, right? Yes, a year. We won't have mailed the sourcebook for 18 months or something by the time we mail the fall sourcebooks, I don't know do we need to go back to mailing sourcebooks twice a year. Do we need to mail this deep like in the markets where we have these magnificent architecturally significant spaces and places we built. How much are those worth to marketing, right? And I get it. Yes, you might be closing stores if you're building kind of crappy stores that are in line in a mall that everybody's got a glass storefront and all you have is your logo up above it that's different. But that's not what we're doing, right? So we're doing something different. So you can't - that's why I say you can't put us in the pandemic pile, right? You can't put us in the pile with everybody else; you'll miss the whole story here. I consider it one of the best questions I got in a long time.",0.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

And then my second question is if you can just give us a little bit more color on the branded inflation. I know in past quarter, I think, you mentioned that I think, now only 10% of your contracts with manufacturers are tied to or contingent on inflation. Can you maybe give us some more color on what percent of EBIT is tied to these agreements? Thank you.","Our growth rate in independents – when we talked about it, I mean, we're talking about really growing by 1% or 2%, which is really just making sure we get our fair share of wallet with our contracted customers. We feel that we have mutual respect with the customers and we've given them we think fair pricing contracts and in return we should get all their generic compliance. And there has been some, you can call it interlopers in the market, where they come and maybe even slice off some brand products and that makes the generic compliance look better. We're saying to our independent customers, we want all your business. We're contracting with you. And that's where we've been focused.

As far as what the amount of brand contracts that are covered by fee-for-service, essentially all of our contracts are covered by fee-for-service. There are some where there's an outcome that could vary depending on the rate of inflation that they experience in their own portfolio. We are moving quickly to close that, as the market changes. So, we are in those discussions. We don't think that that reflects the current market, or the sort of bilateral mutually respectful agreements that we should have with our large branded manufacturers. So, those discussions are ongoing right now. Peyton Howell and her team are on it, and I think we're making progress there. But still more work to be done there for sure.

ABC,Q4,2016,"Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the comments. I have a quick follow-up here. So, first of all, just to confirm, does guidance assume any new share gains from independent groups beyond what you already have gained year-to-date? That's first. And then my second question is if you can just give us a little bit more color on the branded inflation. I know in past quarter, I think, you mentioned that I think, now only 10% of your contracts with manufacturers are tied to or contingent on inflation. Can you maybe give us some more color on what percent of EBIT is tied to these agreements? Thank you.","Yeah, we'll be consistent with what we said in the past. Typically, we've said that about 10% of our gross profit dollars are under those contracts that are – Steve talked about kind of the non-traditional, the type that are – have an element of price appreciation, and Steve mentioned we're working hard to reduce that number.

I guess we would [second] (inaudible) Modern Family I think will be the highest first cycle show ever sold into the marketplace and I think what's driving it is that we have good shows. I mean, I think as people get more and more choices, I think where you get hurt is if you're sort of chopped liver in the middle and if you got hits, I think the value it hits is bigger than ever. You’ve got the NFL or American Idol, Glee, the ability and owner of Modern Family is not always the owner network but when you have those types of shows they have extraordinary value, importance, and power. And I think TV continues to prove itself as a sort of something of importance to consumers and value advertisers second to none. I mean you look at the ad market, as I said, on these national broadcaster cable networks, demand from an advertising perspective is incredible. And I think it shows the power of television, power to importance to consumers or the power to advertisers.

ACAT,Q1,2012,"Yeah, okay. Okay. And then lastly, I think you had a comment about the inventory in the balance sheet, that that is reflective of an earlier build for Snowmobile. Did I hear that correctly?","Yeah, I think I would point to three things. First of all, the overall growth of the business in the fourth quarter, we were up 34% across the board. So that would be the one thing.
Second thing would be last year; we were building snowmobiles well into December, which is something we do not like to do. So we have moved the production date a little bit earlier there. That’s required us to go ahead and start getting some of the longer lead items such as engines in-house and last year, they would not have been on our March closing balance sheet. This year they are.
And then the third thing I would say is with our new monthly ordering system, the RPN system on the ATVs, instead of shipping a lot of products in June, because typically we’d stop in that March timeframe and ship a little bit in April and May, and then really ramp up in June, you’re seeing more of a smoother shipment pattern, so we never really slow down on the ATV and the side-by-side part of our business.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

CTXS,Q3,2020,"Yeah, thank you. I have two quick ones. First, for fiscal 2021, the 4% growth. Can you quantify the headwind from the shift to subscription for us? And then secondly, just on the networking side, David, can you talk about some of the demand in that space? I know you have the shift to subscription that's also creating some headwinds to top line to revenue from networking, but what's the demand in that space? And how do you see that evolving from here?","And to build off of David's comments there, I think what's important to think about in terms of that transition is not only do we have the transition that's continuing from SaaS – from perpetual to turn to SaaS on the Workspace business. But as you think about that networking business, you also have not on the significant uptick we saw this quarter from 29% mix to 66%, but you also have, as David articulated, software and hardware. So now we're at 48% of software. So you have these transitions happening simultaneously, which obviously is embedded in our guidance and our thoughts around how we'll get through that transition and continue to grow through 2021.",2.0,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

And how do you see that evolving from here?","Why don't I take the second part of that first, and then Arlen can talk more about the 2021 number. So networking is an interesting market. I mean, it's clearly one that's in transition for a number of reasons, and some of those are things that we're trying to accelerate. When I see hardware in the networking area down, 20%, 30%, 40% in a quarter, there's a big shift going on. And clearly, in our business, that's been offset by software. Software is growing well over 50% year-on-year. But that's a lot of the outcome of strategy. And so what we're doing is really helping customers in this 'tweener right now. It's just every big customer I talk to is focused on some level of hybrid execution. There's really nobody that is 100% on-prem or 100% in the cloud anymore. It's always somewhere in the middle. And what we can do with our networking assets, of course, is help bridge that fork, being able to deploy networking services across any different form factors, to have a management plane on top of it, which we call ADM, that allows them to run those resources in a public cloud, on-premises in any form of hybrid they want to yet still control it with a common infrastructure. And that's something makes us unique. And that's one of the reasons why when I look at our networking business, and let's exclude the big hyperscalers for a minute. But I look at our networking business over the last few quarters, we have likely outperformed the underlying market. So we're helping drive that transition. And something I said earlier about, we'll continue to do that, but we're also really focused on leveraging networking services in a tighter, more integrated way with the integrated workspace to ensure workspace security, workspace delivery, workspace performance. And so we're kind of working both sides of that strategic equation. And I'd say the overall dynamics in the market should track relatively closely to the types of business outcomes we're showing.",2.0,1.0,2,1.0,2.0,2.0

Are there other opportunities that you see on the to simplify the business further?","How about I take the first one and Peter probably take the second one. So, on the first one, we -- are deferred merchant bookings balance was approximately 8.24 billion as of the end of June. And if you compare to June the previous year, it was approximately 4.6 billion. There was an increase in what we call core deferred merchant bookings, which is our more traditional or conventional locking business. And that reflects obviously improvements on our, I guess that's compared to 2020. So, I think you'll see on the core business that it's largely in line with where the real differences are coming on the side of the business that ultimately is -- and remember that is restricted. There are approximately 4.26 billion in that deferred merchant bookings for Vrbo and that just reflects the healthy growth that we've seen at Vrbo, that we've talked about a number of times before.

As it relates to the pricing environment and what we're expecting, you know, we're expecting a competitive pricing environment, and that's the way we built our model.

So it would actually be lower than that if you include all the changes and new molecules that comes in.And we've planned relatively consistent with that, but I think realistically I think generic deflation over the next three years is probably a single digit kind of number with some years going up a high single digit.

Or where is the disruption most impacting?","So Eric, I would classify it in two ways. I think the large enterprises that are already intimate with Arista and need to make incremental enhancements. We're okay. They are familiar with us. They know how to work with us. We are supporting them. They are our systems engineering team, led by Ashwin, our Sales Team led by Chris Schmidt have tremendous amount of engagement with our existing customers, right?So I don't see a dramatic change yet in sales engagement or product differentiation.

You know if you look at the new customer adds in the quarter, they are still pretty strong and towards the high end of where you have executed over the last couple of years. So I guess the question is you know it still seemed like you executed at some level on the commercial business. What I am trying to solve for is what's underneath that miss executed. Because you added a lot of new logos in the quarter, was it just sort of follow-on business with the existing installed base of commercial accounts where you didn't have those investments to follow up on those accounts and drive incremental revenue?","Yeah. That's a good question. Let me start by saying our sort of land and expand model is as consistent as it's always been, so once we land a customer the pattern of repeat purchases as steady as ever. And you are right, that it was a quarter were customer acquisition was very strong. But what we had invested in was the larger deals which are not as much a reflection on customer count as much as deal sizes and really large deals. What we'd invested in was making that a larger part of our business. And so as that has pressure the number of new customers in the mid-size enterprise had to be even larger than we landed to make up for that shift in investment.

I think as we have said we're making investments in the business especially in the first half of next year that we believe will reaccelerate our growth in the future. And as I alluded to before, the leverage as a result of those investments in the first half of the year will be negative as compared to this year. We expect to see the leverage improving in the second half of next year as we see the benefits of those investments. The other thing I would say as we look at our overall investments, we are doing is somewhat of a careful assessment of spending in to other areas of the business as we increase our investment in these areas of sales and marketing and the commercial business and then broadening the platform that we have. So we're going to be cautious and looking for leverage in other areas of the business, but we expect our investments to start to pay-off in the second half of next year.

GCI,Q3,2013,"Yes, Gracia, a couple of questions on TV and one quick one on all-access. The extra week impact to the newspapers for Q4 is pretty well chronicled. Can you just remind us on TV? The extra week is, I believe, is not quite as significant as a revenue factor for last year. Can you kind of box what that is? Secondly, on TV, I believe you're coming into some pretty important or at least one important retrans negotiation in the fourth quarter. I know you're loathe to talk about that, but any guidance there as to timing and potential impact would be helpful. And then Victoria, you talked all year about the $100 million pretax cumulative benefit from all-access. Are you still on target there to the bottom line, or are you actually ahead?","Well, that's 3 questions, so I'll take the first 2, and then I'll pop the last one over to Victoria. With respect to the 53rd week on television, you're exactly right. The impact was probably in about the $10 million range on total revenues last year for the extra week. And then with respect to -- and for the total company, it was about I think around $60 million and about $0.03 of EPS to frame that extra, extra week when you go back and look at our press release from the fourth quarter of last year. With respect to retrans, we -- as Dave Lougee, who is here with me as well, and I have indicated, we do have one significant deal and one more modest deal coming due, but towards the very end of the quarter, so we don't anticipate anything of consequence in terms of the impact on the fourth quarter. Obviously, we'll have to see how those negotiations go, and then we will be able to give you, once they're completed, some better estimates for our retrans for 2014. But we should see retrans in an absolute basis being roughly comparable to what we posted in the third quarter.

You guided for a 20% or more increase in North Sea day rates for the second quarter, very encouraging there. Would you think that based on the rates that you're booking now that third quarter would be about the same? Or it's a possibility to see a little bit more momentum into the third quarter seasonally and I guess the strongest? What's sort of the moving pieces on that?","I do think there's a little bit of upside in Q3 as well, but my expectation is that they will lock a lot of books currently on the spot market in the remainder of the second quarter and that will run through the third quarter and hopefully into October as well. So I would say, the third quarter may be 3 or 4 percentage points. I'm optimistic for more, but that's what I'm thinking about as I think about third quarter this year so far.",2.0,2.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0

In that meeting will you also consider, or in other meetings consider moving into other brain indications, glioma for example?","Yes, we've had a number of ongoing discussions about moving the 1005 program into primary brain tumors.

And I think that when we looked at how many synergy -- how much there was with synergies with MSC compared to our own company, it just confirmed our overall strategy that we need to be a more closely aligned manufacturing service business. And I think that the folks at BDNA will really appreciate being associated with a pure distribution company. They think distribution, they have been very successful over the years. The sales folks will have a lot more to sell, their product line offering will expand, so I really think this is a win-win. And it's part of our transformational strategy.

AAPL,Q2,2009,"Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the Mac business? It seems that desktop side exceeded our expectations, obviously due to the launch, but sequentially the ASP in desktops if my math is right, looks like it was down quite a bit. Could you just talk about what’s going on in the Mac business, how the new Macs are doing, what you think of your pipeline, but also what’s going on with ASPs like – am I right that there was a mix down in the desktop area and just what’s going on in particular with regard to the mix with this tough economy in maybe notebooks and desktops?","Across the quarter, as we got into March and announced a completely new desktop line, we saw an acceleration of sales and it was that acceleration that allowed us on a sell-through basis to approximately be equal to the year before. After we did the desktop launch, we began to ship a higher mix of desktops than we were before the transition and that helped to push the overall ASP down. Within the desktops themselves, the top end of the line, Mac Pro, we had a lower mix to the Mac Pro, a higher mix to the Mac mini than we had before the transition and really all throughout the quarter, the Pro products that are primarily being sold to the creative professionals, were weaker than they were in the year-ago quarter and we believe that that’s mainly economic related, as you would guess, businesses are cutting back on technology expenditures. In addition, education in the U.S. contracted by about 11% year-over-year and this is a result of states not having the tax revenues as projected and we are hoping that as we get into this quarter that the stimulus funds that were approved last quarter begin to flow to the states and we see some benefit from that. But that remains to be seen. So, net-net, yes, ASP did decline, it was – desktops were a piece of it, but doing all the desktops in a single day, which was – it’s unprecedented for us to do that, really helped us drive more sales in March and get the Mac business to a much better level by the end of the quarter. In the notebook business, we did have an ASP decline sequentially and that was mainly driven by a higher mix to the $999 MacBook that we had announced partway through the quarter in the October – late October timeframe. I think that’s actually a good thing, not a bad thing, because I think what you see is, for us anyway, the consumer is holding up much better than the professional, and much better than education. Education is gated by tax receipts and funding and the professional is really cutting back expenses and delaying – I don’t think it’s business we are losing necessarily, but delaying purchases.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
GCI,Q3,2009,"Yes, good morning and welcome back, Craig. Glad to hear your back is doing better. I guess a two- or three-part question. Can you just tell us, Gracia, your daily and Sunday circulation decline in the third quarter, how was that year over year? And then also, this roughly 28% ad revenue decline in the newspapers in the quarter, how much of that would think is from advertising rate as opposed to volume? I think last quarter, you thought it was about 5 percentage points.","Yeah, on the circulation side of things, I think the declines were similar to what we saw in the second quarter and I think at that time, when Bob Dickey talked about it, he mentioned the fact that we’ve taken a number of aggressive pricing actions on virtually every one of our newspapers. We’ve also reduced permanently some of that out of NDM or an area that’s important to our advertisers, so some of that circulation has been moved out. We’ve also seen some morphing to e-editions, like at USA Today and some other things that we are doing. Clearly we are going to be very careful on continued pricing actions and it is not dissimilar to what we’ve seen in the past where when you take aggressive pricing actions, you see a fall-off in circulation and then you spend some money on retention efforts and on start pressure and the like, and that circulation builds back up. But net net, you see the benefit and we continue to see the benefit of those pricing actions in our revenues. As to rate, I don’t think we can probably add much more than what we said on the second quarter earnings call that you know, again rate there’s not on monolithic rate. There’s online products, there are mobile products, there are all kinds of products that are in the mix and you know, in that 5% range, whether it’s give or take a couple of percentage points, hard to hone in particularly and specifically on that, other than to say that I think we are trying to be sensitive to our advertisers and the situations they find themselves in and trying to be more creative with them and helping them get through this difficult economic period for them as well. And then I think we will have tremendously solidified those relationships and as the economy improves, we will see more dollars flow out of them, as we always had hoped.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

The challenge is to have the vendors acknowledge the realities of the market in the goaling process that we worked through with them. And as we have described in the past, we negotiate virtually every vendor back-end every quarter. And I think in many cases our input and data into the realities of the market are maybe a little bit in front of some of the vendors. And so that negotiation process attempts to bring the vendors to the real-time opportunities and actions that we see in the market. We are up and running for Q1 fiscal year 2010 we have goals in place and we are aggressively attacking them. Some vendors have recognized the realities of the market more aggressively than others.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0

Call it 30% to 100% in some cases. Can you talk about how you managed through that volatility? And whether or not it has any appreciable impact on your financials in terms of volume or profitability?","So I mean we are constantly assessing the cost increases or decreases that we have and making sure that we don't get trapped in situations where we have a big down graft in pricing with a lot of inventory on hand. And like when it goes the other way, when inventory does revalue because of price increases and we work with our customers on what share of that we are willing to share with them. But we're on top of prices, of products all the time. We did see methanol, sodium hydroxide solution, xylene, some of these products went up. And we saw hydrochloric acid dropped about 16% in the quarter versus prior year. So, I would say all in, it's a little more up than down. We like that. We like dynamics in the marketplace because we think we're decent at and getting much better at adjusting our pricing appropriately to get our fair share.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
HSY,Q3,2020,"Yes, hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, building somewhat on earlier questions, I'd love a little bit more color around your general mind-set heading into '21, as you work through your planning process. Clearly there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year international, movie theaters, vending specialty, etc. and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead.
But at the same time, you've been gaining a lot of share, you've had great success in at-home categories like baking and with initiatives like S'mores, all of which is fantastic momentum, but again could set up for difficult year-over-year comparisons.
So as you size it altogether, I guess is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level, to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just net each other out in your mind or are you approaching '21 planning, thinking we've got either a net easier or net harder set up versus what one might consider typical? Thanks.","Yeah. So we're pleased with the momentum that we are seeing and I would say your call-outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs in the business I think are very accurate. We believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment.
And we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So this year, obviously it was consumer shifted to take home and so we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed up baking and we leaned into create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity, giving consumers new ways to participate in Halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions and they have just evolved.
As I mentioned, we were able to dial-in and accelerate e-commerce. And I think as we look to next year, we are prepared if the consumer pivots, yet again, to be able to pivot with them. I think we've built and we've demonstrated an ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an executional perspective, whether it's at retail or in our manufacturing facility.
So we're very focused on that. We've captured as well some cultural positive effects, I think capabilities we've built in terms of operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly and we think that is an enabler for us going forward.

And lots more to come. So it is a bit of a presentation. So the data we have, we have a lot, we haven’t published, we are working on through now with them. And things have been published, as well as don’t forget, it was published in the pig model on the therapy. And I think from, as you can see from the poster RFA was an extremely good marker for the disease progression also, and worked incredibly robustly and stabling. And we are also that this was all on a plate system, obviously, you probably want more things faster, and in a very situation than just every six hours. So that is quite fast. So we are also working, putting the sepsis platform on beads, so it can be done in 45 minutes. And also potentially point of care. So theoretically, you could have almost instantaneous measurement of the next level. And if you think for those who wondering how that is useful, I think, you know, Bruce, if you are in a hospital, sepsis is a big killer, it creeps up on you. And it kills you for two main reasons. One it is very early to diagnose early and really get ahead of, and two the treatments aren’t actually that great for, and there is often a lot of tritton, there aren’t many. So there is no good diagnostic for it really certainly nothing in real time. And there is no real legal therapy, but that is partly because there is not a good diagnostic.

AXAS,Q4,2012,"Yes, it sounds like it when I see the flows that you're getting, well above your anticipated curve. The only other question I had has to do with, again, the result of some study of -- seeing quite a bit being written now about the Permian, that there are now 400 rigs drilling there and a lot of excitement having to do with the Cline Shale indicating that perhaps there's another 35 million barrels of oil down in there on top of the 35 that have been taken out of the play since 1917 or whatever. And I know we have activities in the Permian. Are we in an area that would include the Cline Shale and is what I'm reading viable or is it a little bit of hype?","I think it's certainly of interest. It's still early stage. And specifically for Abraxas, 2 of our rather large held-by-production acreage blocks have now been offset by Devon, Cline Shale wells. One of them is on production. We're getting daily production from that well. It appears to be very commercial. It's within less than one mile of our Millican Reef held-by-production acreage. Our Spires Ranch has been offset by a direct offset, 500 feet off our lease line by a Devon, Cline Shale well. And at our last report, they were installing artificial lift equipment on that well and building a tank battery.

TECD,Q4,2008,"Yes, just a follow-up on the inventory. It was down sequentially more than sales but I think it still a little bit elevated relative to the historical levels. Can you just Jeff, elaborate on why that’s the case and in what regions and product categories to the extent you can comment remain more elevated that others in just what your targeted inventory turns are, going forward, how could we get that down?","Yes, I think first of all we are very happy with the inventory, and two, we are happy with how much of that we own versus our vendors own. The increase in inventory was offset by the increase in accounts payable.

I think, if I look at one factor and there is always many factors Brian, it's just as Bob alluded in his comments, sales decline accelerated in January. And so, probably ended up with a little bit of extra inventory compared to the sales that we experienced in the month of January. So, on the positive side, our inventory is clean, the ageing is strong. It will sell-through quickly or already has in February. I think also when you are doing your analysis and comparison the numbers that we just reported, of course, compared to others includes the month of January. And not to overemphasize but from every vendor and their comments about their Q1 forecast, we know that the decline in the market accelerated as we entered the new calendar year. So, I think that shows the strength of our operation especially through the end of last calendar year.

It’s flagging inventory that we see as aged inventory or duplicative fuse in our assortment.

OCX,Q1,2020,"Yes, let me add to that, Lyndal, a little bit. Paul, one of the beauties of our opportunity with pharma is this longitudinal bio-bank that we have that follows patients with blood draws across time and looks at the progression of disease. And it’s kind of unheard of in our industry to have an active bio-bank. And Doug, I know you – this is one of the things that you mentioned a lot in terms of the value of what we bring to pharma. Maybe just a 30-second vignette on sort of why it’s so important to have this type of access to longitudinal patients that are being actively followed.","Yes. So the clinical indication here is the question of what do you do when you see a lung nodule in a patient for which the current clinical paradigm is pretty unclear. Do you stick a needle into the nodule and try and make a diagnosis of tumor versus benign or do you watch and wait and repeatedly scan them to figure out what to happen. And I believe the size of this bio-bank, 3,000 patients to date and growing, is unprecedented and it allows us not only to evaluate the current signature, the DX product that’s in clinical validation, but as we try and move to perhaps rule in test. It’s an amazing recourse for evaluating different technologies that can detect tumor in blood. So I’m very excited about the potential of that bio-bank not just because of the DX which we’ll get the results in June, but also as we move towards detecting tumors and partnering with other folks that may have technologies that may be useful in blood.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,1.0,2.0

So the doctors we talk to do recognize that this is not elective and so obviously the more you postpone these surgeries, the greater the chance that that cancer will actually become more advanced and untreatable. So we do expect – and they’re already seeing these surgeries resume. Similar to the economy, I don’t think it’s going to be a sudden hockey stick [ph].

Steve, it’s a great question and I’m going to give you probably more detail than you want on this. So just to be careful and I’ll let Padma chime in and add color commentary. But what we see is different areas of the country impacted differently and we chose regions of the country for our initial six reps to go concur based on high value or high volume incident rates of lung cancer with assertive thoracic surgeons that we knew were seeing a large number of patients. Some of those surgeries and some of those really account our own states that are opening back up, others are not. And I’m going to give you just anecdotally here locally in Orange Country because I’m very active in the local hospital community here. We had three hospitals who despite the volume of COVID cases still elected to save ventilators and save anesthesiology for a potential upswing in the outbreak. And so they basically stopped anything that was not an urgent surgery, so anything deemed elective. Now, you and I would agree that early stage lung cancer is traditionally not elective. In fact, I’ve seen statistics where somewhere around 8% to 10% increase in potential recurrence every month an early stage lung cancer patient goes without surgery. So we do expect to see those surgeries to pick back up just because as you say they’re really not elective. These surgeries are important for these patients but a lot of it has less to do with the patient situation and a lot to do with availability of surgical suites.

The way we’re looking at it though is assuming that again assuming the worse in that we aren’t able to divest the production assets, what would the capital requirements on the production side be. We’ve been pairing back capital investment in production as part of this whole process and going forward I think it’s fair to say that that’s sort of built up a capital requirement that if we are to be operating the properties next year the capital investment on production would be greater than 2010.

We won't know until the end of the March quarter kind of how things turn out, but I think that the new promotions that they are running which are based on – giving away the free DVR server, lot of Quad Play bundling, more aggressive pricing, a lot of these things seem to be getting some initial traction and the initial kind of soft feedback we are getting around that is quite positive. So although we're going to experience some more difficult in Q1 based on their Q4 results, we are hopeful that towards the end of Q1 or definitely in Q2 we should start seeing a little bit of a recovery in that business.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,0.0,2.0
VNRX,Q1,2021,"Yes, thank you, Cameron. That is very helpful on the revenue front. And then maybe just thinking about margins, I have always thought of Nu.Q as having a particularly attractive cost of goods. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on those costs, and maybe compare contrast to other testing modalities that are out there and the costs attractive, and then how silver one plays into that in the long-term?","Yes, it is very interesting, it is in some ways as follows. I obviously have an MBA to study a few of these things. It follows in some ways a kind of a software model in terms of our whole idea in all this is not just to offer a license, but still the key components so that we can maintain quality, also have a good idea of actually how many they are selling. And particularly in developing countries in countries where you might not see a royalty get revenue early on. So at the moment, on the plate based format, it costs around $4 each $5 per test. But sometimes you have to do repeats. So you might have to it might be a few a few of those to get it. Once you on beads, there is no need for a very few repeats. And the cost goes down a lot, maybe even half or less than that. And we are in the process of changing over to beads now for the different platforms. So silver one, so I think it is sort of moving forward, we are seeing in Vet space, obviously, we have a very good margin, and so does everyone in the chain. And I think we are looking to make it a mass market product. I think it is something which particularly is part of the world of screening tests, could easily be something which we target to having several hundreds of thousands or millions of tests per year. And I think perhaps we need to be a slightly lower price point. But given the fact that our cost of goods are going to be dropping a lot, it is probably a very similar margin, we have just a lot more throughput in on the product front. So it is, I think we are in a very unique position because we have something which we can, when the cost of goods as low as ours are and I think it is full production, we could be at just a few dollars, per se, or even less if it is in simple terms. You can kind of put the, we have to recoup obviously the large investment we made in this space, but you can put the product at pretty much any price we have a very attractive margin. And that is we are all about a volume business. So we don’t want to sell a few things at a very high price. We want to really dominate, not just on the plates, but magnetic beads also on the point of care and make it a test. And if we do progress on the step society, it is something which I think could be taken by a very large percentage of people in hospital regularly to check to see if they are starting to develop sepsis, for example. And to do that you can’t be $200 or $300 a test, you would have to be well below $100. I think it is going to be something which is really, really mass market. But then the numbers of tests go up massively. So it is either way, we have a very high margin, I think, but we are really pushing for volume of sales.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
TECD,Q4,2008,"Yes, thank you. I just wanted to talk a little more about the SG&A, it sounds like you have done some pruning, but still no plans for additional cost cutting despite the 20% down sales, year-over-year. I mean is that because you think that you want to be well positioned in both regions when business comes back or do you think we might be close to the bottom in terms of where sales shake out.","We have had the strategy of. certainly over the last three or four quarters Matt, to try to match our cost structure as well as we can to what we see in the market. And yet we don’t want to go one headcount further then we need to because we believe that when the economy does turn around, IT spending will be one of the elements that lead the economy back. We want to be in the right position to take advantage of it. Now having said that, we started to ratchet back spending almost three quarters ago in both geographies, although we didn’t do large headcount reductions, in both geographies hiring has been virtually frozen over those three quarters, and so have been able to avoid adding a lot of people even though our revenues and profits were improving, we added them through productivity enhancements both at the sales level and in our logistics infrastructure.

Recall that we invested millions of dollars of SG&A to install a new warehouse management system in all of our logistics centers around the world. that project is now complete. And so the leverage and productivity that we were able to realize there allowed us to keep headcounts flat or declining even though our volumes continue to go up. So, we continue to try to balance cost, our cost and expense with the opportunity that we see. We are prepared to continue to make those adjustments as necessary to balance the opportunity and our cost structure.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,1.0,2.0
AAPL,Q2,2009,"Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit Mac question. Your Mac business was down 8% in the Americas, I presume that the US was potentially worst than that. According to Gartner, the US market was flat this quarter. Though you actually did lose material share and I think as you noted despite the fact that you had a new desktop line up that created a surge in your run rate at the end of the quarter. So I guess given that statement, one, do you care about your market share in the US? And second, given the movement in ASPs that you saw towards the lower end and given your share performance in the US, does that shape or change your thinking about Mac pricing in anyway?","On – Toni, it’s Tim. On a worldwide basis, just to make sure we’re in sync with the numbers, IDC projected a – that the market contracted by 7% worldwide. On a reported basis, we contracted by 3%, but as Peter said in his opening comments on a sell-through basis, we were essentially flat year-over-year. In the US, the US was our weakest, largest geography in terms of comparison year-over-year. But I would remind you that in our US business, a larger percentage of that business is education oriented and therefore subject to the budget constraints that have been significant in many, many other states, actually almost of the states. And so I think that’s one reason why the US is disproportionately affected. And the second is that we saw a less pro Macintoshes being bought in the US on a relative basis to other geographies and we would attribute that also to the economy. There were some mix found there across the world that’s much more so in the US where I think the professional markets have been hit much harder. And so do I care about US share, of course, I do. However, I think cycles come and cycles go. And what we’re about is making the best computers in the world, not making the most, and not getting to a point where we are building products that we are not building products that we are not proud of. And so that first and foremost is our objective and we believe that if we do that over the long-term that we will gain share. We’re – I am not going to worry about the ebb and flow of each 90 days, because I think that leads you to make a lot of short-term decisions that are not good for the company or for the brand over time.",2.0,2.0,0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Really, September, my appreciation was a low point. Future will tell of course, but as we see a continued trend, still relatively weak order rates, but definitely better than they were in September.

BBBY,Q2,2019,"Yes, thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify, when you said that the inventory fell-through, that should not have a gross margin impact throughout the rest of the year, so I just want to clarify that. And then my other question on gross margins is like the shipping costs seem to be a benefit in the second quarter. So was that driven by lower sales and that’s why shipping costs were better?And then now looking into the back end of the year, if you expect that your sales are going to improve throughout the year and the BEYOND+ membership promotions that you have during the holiday season, should we expect gross margins to be down because of shipping costs or should that have a negative impact? Thank you.","So that was a multi-part question. I’m going to start with the first one, and I may have to ask you to repeat a couple of your sub-bullet points. So, on the inventory you’re asking about the margin impact as we take out the merchandise.Again, we’re mindful not to cannibalize sales, you know during the holiday period and we can, using a third-party liquidator, remove that merchandise from our stores, but not have it out in the market competing, you know competing against ourselves or be liquidating it in a heavy fashion during this time frame.And then I think you asked about shipping expense.

I want to say four of those restaurants were Seritage or Sears deals from a year ago. So like all the New York -- New York was, [indiscernible], Rhode Island was and as a result, those investments were in the $4 million or less range because we were delivered a shell and we were delivered some of the utilities and stuff forward. I would tend to say that, and I'm going to let Greg -- Greg Lynds jump in here in a second, I would tend to say though, looking a little bit going forward that we continue to see labor inflation in the construction world as well as some material inflation and we tend to see our standard prototype probably closer in the 4, 8 range or greater; so $4.8 million plus range and so it's a mixed bag. I know the eight, we have some that we got in at a really low investment cost, I think overall, but I think if you're thinking about going forward, it's a little bit higher.

So, it was a tremendous result and as Peter mentioned earlier in his remarks, the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch is now about 37 million units and so, it provides an enormous platform for developers to develop on and with the – with our recent SDK changes the developers are working on now, I think it just unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

On the balance sheet, I just want to comment for the second quarter, we do expect a slight build in inventory dollars to the tune of about $20 million.

So Matt, this is Steve. I’ll take that one. First of all, there’s a lot of news out there about the automotive market, having shuts down – shutdowns due to semiconductor shortages, and just want to remind everybody we don’t do automotive. So in terms of our end market impact, there’s nothing there. Now specifically, what’s causing those challenges in automotive is a tightening in semiconductor components. And we are seeing some of that. We don’t foresee any issues here in the fiscal second quarter. We’re from an inventory standpoint and that we feel pretty comfortable where we’re at. We do start to see lead times start to extend a little pricing pressure here and there. So it’s definitely real from our perspective. I feel like you’re pretty comfortable where we’re at. Our teams definitely have to work harder through these periods, but at these times is when our teams have outperformed. And so I’m pretty optimistic in terms of what our teams will be able to do. The one part that I get a little nervous on is, looking at those forecasts as we go into the back half of the year. If our customers start dropping in big demand our ability to react and bring things in is really kind of the bigger challenge. And so we have been talking to our customers about inventory levels in what we’re comfortable storing. Now keep in mind, our customers are responsible for the inventory levels. Plexus doesn’t speculate. So from our standpoint, it’s really just working through with our customers where they need to be. And we do have some – we do have some customers that have increased raw component inventories to be able to respond to upside demand in the back half of the year. And so again, it’s a mix with each customer, but it is a – we do see it coming a bit more, but I think we’re responding appropriately.

The – spending we’re really looking at CapEx just south of $7 million between – basically between now and in mid-year. So, in terms of the ramp-up both in terms of equipment and the lines in terms of staffing it’s on a pretty steep slope here in terms of being complete by mid-year. So, as you look at the – the startup costs that I mentioned sort of the – labor efficiencies as we bring new people on. We really expect to add to sort of pay per down to mid-year and basically go away at mid-year.

And more importantly, what's your visibility additional clarity on how long this impact might last?","Yes. Greg, that’s a good question. Definitely the Americas is challenging. We thought we'd see improvement through the quarter and we are not seeing that through the third quarter. Europe – the difference between the Americas and the Europe is: Europe, we have some programs that are going on that are helping to feed the pipeline; whereas, in the Americas, we were at the end of some programs at the end of last year and the newer programs really just started picking up and it keeping delayed from quarter-to-quarter.",1.0,1.0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0

First of all, as you look at the DIRECTV MoCA deployment, will that have similar lag as Verizon, meaning whatever net adds they will have, they will have like a quarter later impact on your business?","Well, right now, we are building product in advance of their launch, and they are launching in some percentage of the US They typically, with other product launches they have done, they're going some percentage of the US and then go nationwide a quarter after that. So, I think you'll see a continued ramp in that business over the next couple of quarters just based on that build-out. Then they typically move into a really seasonal strong area as they get into the fall and kind of through that time all the way through the Superbowl. So I think that that business is going to continue to be a good ramp business for us throughout 2010 and even into early 2011. The thing that could drive growth even further than that is a bigger conversion away from standard def towards high def. Because we're high-def platforms, so as we see more and more consumers move their pay-TV service from standard def to high-def with DIRECTV as well as with everybody else in the industry, I think that's going to favor Entropic MoCA solutions.",2.0,0.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0

I guess when you look at the document management, obviously there has been huge profitability gain over the last year and the gross margin is far and away the highest in the business. Can you give us some sense on a relative basis? How you think about the composition of cost of goods sold versus SG&A? And I know you are not going to tell me where you think the margin ultimately end up at maturity, but is there some sense that as you look at all the businesses, there is not really that much structural difference? And what costs going those two lines?","I think you asked two things. One paper prices have been very solid, recently that helps, but then also you have to remember that in document shredding you don’t have material cost. You are paying a driver, you have a plan that’s essentially on wheels, if you are shredding it at customer’s location, so margins are improved, but you are paying more in the SG&A lines to run the business from our operation so to speak, from the management perspective and from the logistics perspective. But not every material cost can actually turn around selling the paper makes a difference when paper prices are higher, again, some benefit there.

Do you think there's been a philosophical -- a shift in these top 50 that have sort of said, we've got what we've want in the IDW and then for specific use cases, they will be point solutions and we don't need to reintegrate that back at a granular level into an IDW, which, when said, obviously begs the question if there will be expansion in the IDW in those companies?","The IDW, as far as business transaction data in the business object areas, will continue to go on in the world with the analytical ecosystem, such as Gartner says about data warehousing and what we're saying. The ability of it to grow is mostly centered on the growth in business transaction data. That said, there is new data types or incremental data that's coming into the analytical ecosystem that will get processed and refined in Hadoop and elsewhere, but where subsets of that data will be going back into the integrated data warehouse, and it'll be small subsets of data. But what drives the integrated data warehouse and our growth there is less about the amount of data, it's more about the queries, the users and more -- and processing and more value that we bring to the business users. So if you think about the amount of data going in the integrated data warehouses, it'll grow like it's always grown. It won't grow at the -- like the analytical ecosystem and Hadoop that's digesting these huge data volumes, but it will grow data at a slower rate than the rest of the analytical ecosystem. But it will grow the types of queries, processes, processing end users and business value that can be gained in the IDW. So even the customers with the well-built-out IDWs, which is the minority here when we're talking about the top 50, they will continue to come up with more uses, more information for their business users.

Keep in mind, it's a proprietary technology. So it's not going to be widely or pervasively available to other vendors like Dell or HP or Samsung anyone to integrate into their device. So that's kind of a separate issue. On the subscription side, we have a handful of customers. We just started that push. Barbara really began that change in the second quarter and so we have a handful of customers and we think that will grow over time. It certainly makes it more affordable for these customers to be able to buy or acquire the technology and deploy it. So it's good for them and it's good for us because it will ultimately make us more predictable long term, but many companies, especially many small and medium sized software companies are going through this transition and it can be somewhat painful in the beginning, but I think in the long term, it's going to pay off.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,1.0,2.0

And then, second, could you provide a framework for Zeposia sales drivers in coming years in both the U.S. and ex-U.S.? Thanks very much.
","Yeah, thanks for the question, David. The way to look at it, though, as Chris mentioned earlier, there's still a large number of patients who are treated with either single agent I-O or through non-I-O regimens. So yes, O plus Y is a very important regimen, has shown very important efficacy and long-term effects and maintenance of that effect and so therefore, it becomes important. What we are now bringing is an additional, let's say, treatment potential for patients who can be treated, who have melanoma in the first-line setting with relatlimab on top of nivolumab as a single agent.
And that's the reason why we're excited about this, to be able to add to the treatment paradigm for prescribers and for patients to potentially use in the future once approved in this particular setting. One has to remember that we are also talking about the safety profile and its differentiation over here. So relatlimab plus nivolumab, therefore, becomes an important aspect of the treatment paradigm looking at the future.

And then, second, could you provide a framework for Zeposia sales drivers in coming years in both the U.S. and ex-U.S.? Thanks very much.
","Yeah. And then, let me take the question on Zeposia, David. So the way we think about Zeposia is, first of all, we're very excited about the opportunity initially that we have both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.
in MS. We think that Zeposia brings a very differentiated profile into this market. It's now in the U.S., the No. 1 SP in terms of written prescriptions.
We're gaining on oral agents. And as I mentioned earlier, we are making progress in terms of optimizing the patient pull-through in terms of commercial dispense. So we think we've got considerable opportunity to continue to grow in the short term in MS in the U.S. Ex U.S., it's still very early days for the launches of Zeposia, but I would say that in the early launch markets in Europe, Zeposia's uptake appears to be very good, particularly in markets like Germany.
So I think in the near term, there's going to be clearly a focus on maximizing the opportunity that we have with Zeposia in that market globally. And then, of course, with the upcoming launch in UC, that becomes a much more important opportunity for us as we get into 2022 and beyond. Zeposia's profile looks very good. The feedback we've gotten from treaters in the IBD space is very positive.
Obviously, the rate limiter in terms of the U.S. uptake is gonna be accessed. We know that's a very important component, and we are going to approach that in a very stepwise fashion. It's going to be important that we drive volume initially in those patients -- with those patients who have insurance that is open or relatively unrestricted.
And then, we'll leverage the Zeposia profile to drive additional utilization and then, of course, work with payers to ensure that we continue to increase the access that patients have in that space. That will clearly take some time. But we think the opportunity in IBD for Zeposia is substantial. And that will be important both in the U.S.
and ex-U.S. as we get into that launch in -- later in 2021 and then, certainly 2022 and beyond.

NAFC,Q4,2007,"Yes. That's helpful. And then on the retail side, are you seeing actually first anything else on the acquisition landscape outside of the Albertson's that you acquired?","We don't have anything today that is anything of substance to discuss. I would tell you that again at the end of the third quarter, we said that that was one of the things that we hoped would be something we could accomplish more in 2008 than we did in 2007. I think the credit markets and the market probably works in our favor that we might be able to get some things done this year that might have been a little bit more difficult to have gotten done a year ago. I think for those that have a strong balance sheet and access to capital, those companies such as Nash Finch is in the best position to be and acquire for those that might want to divest their companies and leave their business.

I would tell you though that the types of acquisitions that we would consider and that we would be looking for as I've said before, I am not looking for a home run. I just want to look for a few base hits and when we can find a strong perishable company or specialty food company or a meat business that would complement our existing business within our current geography where there is a lot of synergies, those are the kinds of deals that we would be most interested in. We don't have anything to talk about today and also I might mention that to the extent that we could determine a proper acquisition in our Military business. We have always been open to considering that but those are the kinds of things that we are looking for, something that we can manage properly, manage the risk, integrate properly and where we don't bet the ranch on one single deal.

SPTN,Q4,2014,"You guys are now I guess kind of 15 plus months past the close of the deal with Nash and as you guys think about the last year or so what the team has learned, some of the positives, the prizes, some of the hurtles, are you more excited about certain opportunities now than you were maybe a year ago, or on the flipside are there things that are taking a bit longer to play out than maybe you had originally anticipated? Any color there would be helpful.","I think we are really on plan with regard to 15 months in, I’ll start out by saying that. You may recall, a year ago at this call we laid out some guide posts for the business for this year. I said we expected sales between $7.9 billion and $8.0 billion and you see we delivered on that number. We said we were expecting synergies of $20 million. I’ve told you consistently that we’ve beaten the synergy number. We said we expected EBITDA between $230 million and $239 million, the number here today is $234 million plus in EBITDA, right there in the middle of that range. We actually guided EPS of $1.65 to $1.75 and yet we’re reporting $1.85. You think about beating that number and being in the range, I think you’re going to understand why we feel pretty good about being able to call where we were going to be able to come out despite the fact that’s not an easy modeling exercise to do. Then you take the $1.85, on a 52 week basis it’s $1.80 as we pointed out and you look at the guidance next year and we’re saying we’re going to go 5% to 10% more than that already accelerated number from the original expectation, I think you might glean from that we’re feeling pretty optimistic about where things are today and where we can go. It really is only 15 months in and there is a full three years’ worth of work in the integration. There’s a lot left to do, but I think we have fundamentally transformed the company and I think we’ve built the foundation as truly a platform for growth and as I look at the space I don’t feel any differently than I did a year ago with regard to their will continue to be opportunities to consolidate the space as scale and size become more and more important.

And then the other thing is I know you normally don’t like to comment too much on capacity utilization, but it feels like utilization for glass capacity is getting relatively high, and I wonder if you could just comment on that, give us any color, on what you think capacity utilization looks like. And then also, for panel, just where are we with capacity utilization and where you think we’ll be as we get into the seasonally high month here heading into the back end of the year?","That’s a lot of questions. On our assumption on China demand, we’re assuming the subsidy has gone off. We’re not including anything coming back in our outlook for the remainder of the year. All we’ve heard is some rumors that there may be a new subsidy in the fourth quarter, but that’s not in our demand at this point in time. Relative to capacity utilization, our wholly-owned display business is relatively full. We’re delighted by that, as you saw the very strong shipments in quarter two.

We've not provided guidance beyond that. But one of the things I would point out to everybody, both in analyzing the fiscal '13 results and the fiscal '14 guidance, is the growth of subscriptions. It's high-teens growth in both years for growth of subscriptions. And we -- and that factors out even the currency impact of the yen for the fiscal '14 year. As we said last year, and I'll just reiterate, our strategy on services is to help us enable our customers to do what they want to do and basically, it's to sell subscriptions. So we have been working with our partners to try and -- try to enable more partners to be able to deliver the consulting so that we don't have to do it.

PLNR,Q2,2012,"You talk about the price points in the marketplace and any structural cost pressure that are the industry is experiencing that it can or cannot pass through in terms of your selling prices. What is going on in that regard, that’s another gross margin issue that’s not related to volume.","Yes, it's a little different story in each of the different product lines, but I’d say that in most of the either product lines that’s been around a while or fairly generic product lines, I’d say there is probably overcapacity in the marketplace, some pricing is challenging. I don’t think that’s particularly worse today than it was three months or six months ago, but it is challenging. So, for desktop monitors for instance there is plenty of supply and there is always the challenges is that over supply in this quarter or whatever and what’s going on with the pricing etcetera there. I think in rear projection cubes it really matured technology, there is once again I think over supply as I think market is not growing and the players that are read it have more capacity than is available to be consumed and so we do see some pricing pressure there. In the places where things are a little more innovative or newer some of the tiled LCD walls we see pressure that it multiple competitors in the market but we have some uniqueness, so not as quite much pressure on some of those areas. So, I’d say that the bulk of our gross profit issues are either related to volume or mix our products have different gross profit levels obviously.

Can you maybe talk about whether or not you feel a partner in the US, given the complexity of that trial design would want to be involved in these current discussions around trial design and anything you might go to the FDA with?","I think the first thing partner will want to see the data from the Phase 2 12 month follow up, and if that virological data is exciting, then all bets are off right because the devil is in the detail, it is all in the data. I can stand here and tell you virological endpoints are good enough, but if we can show immunocompromised patient that those virological endpoints indeed can be achieved, then you can get a partner excited.

Secondly everybody knows that this is a slam dunk. Normally if you get a Phase 2 study done and if you can complete a Phase 3 study done with an agreed upon endpoint with the FDA and the vaccine is efficacious as we have seen so far. This is a locked up market, we’ve [awful] drug status. The people are getting as a matter of point cell transplants or CMV positive, they will take this vaccine okay.

So there is not issue of market penetrability or unknowns about how to achieve the commercial goal. So those are two very clear, the third thing everybody knows that, CMV disease is not a valid endpoint because the entire treatment paradigm is based on virological endpoints and if the FDA is going to insist on doing CMV disease, it will require a huge trial and this will make the full program removed.

And so everybody knows including the clinical experts who are working with us. Remember how they treat people, they used PCR or whatever local assays and they look at the number of [copies] in the blood every week.

And then they put on an antiviral such as Ganciclovir. CMV disease occurs in less than 2% or 3% of the patient. So that’s not a relevant endpoint and that’s the goal and that’s the pieces and that’s the expert opinion that we are taking to the agency.

TTE,Q4,2021,"[Foreign Language] It's Mickael. Congratulations from my side as well on the results. Two questions, if I may. One on shareholder returns and one on renewables. On shareholder returns, if I look at the dividend, the $2 billion buyback, it's effectively 40% distribution of your cash flow under your conservative assumptions of $60 oil, $10 MMBtu. I was wondering for modeling purposes, if the macro proves to be more generous which looks likely at this point in time, should we assume that we can continue to have a 40% payout on the incremental cash flow there which more or less is what you have delivered through the cycle over the last few years.

My second question is on renewable power. It's something I find very difficult to model at the moment because there are so many different forces at play. There's higher power prices on one side with also a repricing of intermittency but on the other side, much higher costs across the value chain and there is a beginning of the rate rise cycle with higher cost of capital as well for project financing and each of those pulls the equity returns in different directions. I was just wondering, when you look at your opportunities in renewable power, especially in offshore wind, how do you compare the return on equity and the opportunities there versus where you were seeing them 1 year ago?","Okay. The 40%, again, I just explained that is -- yes, you are right. The way we calculate the dividend is -- the increase of the dividend is plus $1 billion, $400 million. It represents 5% of the $8 billion we distribute. So that's right. So it's a guidance where we think it's a good guidance. Having said that, sometimes like in 2021, we were targeting that, when the price increase quicker than we were able to make the buyback. So we reached 33%. So it's a 35%, 40% is a range which is in the mindset of our Board of Directors. So it's -- if you want to model, you can use it. On the renewable part, I think, yes, things are moving. And again, it's a matter of -- and this is, for me, something which -- where we have an evolution in the company. Now when we enter into that field, we see maybe it's a secure business, you have these PPAs that's fair. The more we look at it, the more we think that we have more value to create if we accept to, I would say -- and it's like LNG, I would say. LNG historically, we're willing long-term contracts to invest. And then we decided around 2005, let's buy the LNG for ourselves and let's become a player in the market, arbitration, etcetera.

And you've seen the positive results in '21, 15 years after we engaged in the strategy. I think we are looking to more and more renewables and power assets as also a capacity to maybe it's 50% which will be, I would say, secure but the other part. We have, because of our balance sheet, the capacity, providing we have also storage capacities, providing we have also trading teams, strong teams to leverage the volatility. And we are, I would say -- the more I'm looking to this market, the more I'm thinking that the electricity price could go higher and higher. So, I think it's better to keep -- so when we analyze an investments like the one you mentioned offshore wind, it's not only one of the key parameters will be the anticipation that you have on the power pricing in 2030 by the way, 2035. And so my view is that, yes, let's keep part of it on PPAs where you secure, I would say, a base return. But do -- we have to accept as well the profitability. We just recruited the Chief Economist outside of our oil and gas markets, in the electricity markets in order to help us to better modelized that.

So for me and I think this is justifying this view why a company like us is entering into the business, not to secure revenues but to be able to leverage the integration again and the volatility.",2.0,1.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0
HOME,Q4,2017,"[Indiscernible] on for Simeon. So a follow-up to an earlier question on the wages, how are you guys thinking about your hourly wages versus the marketplace right now?"," So you know we've heard a lot of talk about the retailers using the benefit from the lower tax rate to make long overdue investments in employees. And then what we love about our company is rather than a one-time event, we've been investing in our employees each year.
So some examples of that, we've raised our starting hourly wage for store employees several years ago. We made all employees in our business eligible for bonus. In fact full time employees that achieved bonus this year in our stores achieved over $1100 bonus.
Our average hourly pay out at the store level was 5% of their earnings. We implemented a 401 (k) match with immediate vesting. We expanded paid leave for new mothers, fathers and adopted parents. We launched a training platform for our employees showing them how to get to the next level and grow.
And best of all, all of these have given them the potential to grow and make a career with us. So for us the key metric really has been turnover and in the last four years our turnover has really been cut in half. So in each year we've made those investments in our employees rather than a one-time event.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,0.0
NAFC,Q4,2007," And then just one question about the retail business, I know you had indicated that year-over-year excluding that $2.6 million charge, it would have improved and I could have a flaw in my model but I was under the impression that last year also had a one-time benefit that hit the -- took about it was like a $1.1 million of costs so that if you exclude both from both years it actually would be down, is that inventory markdown?","The map as you describe it, Karen, is absolutely right but from an operating perspective the flavor behind that I don't think is so correct because when you look at what we did a year ago, we took a $1.1 million cash charge because we were closing stores because something was wrong. The business wasn't performing. We were hurting. We had to get out of some operations.

To me, that's a whole different proposition from when you take a $2.6 million charge simply because you chose to change an estimate in your promotional markdowns. There was no pressure to do that. Nothing was wrong. Nothing's broken. So I think that the issue that we have is that we've put it on the same line and that I think causes people to want to compare those two. In reality, I don't really see them as comparable items because I was under no pressure to make the change in estimate that impacted the $2.6 million, but I can assure you that a year ago I was clearly under pressure to do something to stop the bleeding in some of these stores that were underperforming. I just see them as entirely two different things and not apples and apples.

But the math as you describe it is 100% right. There's nothing wrong with the map. My point is, is that if I had closed stores last year and I close stores this year, those are comparable apples and apples. I haven't closed any stores. Nothing is wrong with my business. I just simply chose to change an estimate in promotional markdowns in order to more effectively manage my business and I think that's hard to compare that to a year ago when we were closing stores because we had real problems out there.",2.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0
B,Q4,2012,"Couple of questions. First on the transaction. Because I know your tax rates differed so much by jurisdiction, how much EPS accretion was there in 2012 from the business you're selling?","Yes. Again, for purposes of disclosure, Matt, we don't get to the SBU level.",0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0
BBBY,Q2,2019,"Great! Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just a little bit more detail on the progress of the CEO search process. How many candidates you are down to? What does soon mean? And are you still within ""weeks"" as you guys have laid out in your shareholder letter?","So to answer the last part of your question first, yes, we are definitely down to the final weeks. I’m not going to get into the details of the number of candidates, but you know we have been very actively focused on the search. We’ve got a great search firm working with us. We’ve had great interest in the position. So we’ve had quite a number of strong candidates.As I think we had mentioned before, we’re looking for somebody with you know retail transformation experience, innovation, online and digital experience, marketing experience. So we’re looking for all of the things that we would need to really continue the transformation of the business and we feel good about where we are in the process. And so you know, we expect to be naming a permanent CEO soon.",2.0,1.0,0,2.0,0.0,2.0
B,Q4,2012,"So first question, if I could just -- Chris, you talked a little bit about BDNA and the numbers there with Raymond, but the total segment's $350-some-odd million in revenue, you've quoted about $300 million in the press release, so is it safe to assume that Raymond's about $50 million business and can we make the assumption to around a corporate level EBITDA margin kind of business just as we're doing this math looking forward?","Yes, I would say, first of all, again, we're cautioned to comment on SBU-related profitability. But you're right, Peter, when you think about the $50 million roughly for our Raymond business would be transferred into Industrial.",2.0,0.0,0,0.0,2.0,2.0
BBBY,Q2,2019,"Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I was first hoping to dive a little bit into the gross margin aspect. Can you maybe give us a little color by concept or maybe month-by-month the progress you’re making in improving the margin structure? And then basically the same question on the SG&A side too. If we can get some color around, you know month-over-month how it’s improved and where the bigger opportunities last are for the remainder of the year?","Sure. Just to address your point on breaking out the components by concept, that is not you know historically been our reporting cadence to break it out at that granular level, but from a gross margin perspective, you know we are pleased that this quarter, we have favorable trends, 20 basis points improvement, that is a significant shift from what we’ve been experiencing from a trending perspective, and it’s driven by benefits in coupons and net direct to customer shipping with some offset in merchandise margins.But that merchandise margin, which I’m talking about on a consolidated basis, the trend in that has been improving due to some of the ongoing initiatives that we have in place. So for some select products, we’ve actually moved to direct importing and gained efficiencies from our own supply chain, which has benefited us. We’ve also been actively engaging in vendor negotiations around our merchandise, and then we’ve also continued with some strategic pricing initiatives which has helped benefit our margin, and we have more to come.",2.0,2.0,1,2.0,2.0,2.0
