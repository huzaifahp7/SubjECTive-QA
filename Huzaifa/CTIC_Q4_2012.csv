Robert Cummins Hazlett,James A. Bianco," I have 2 questions actually. First on Pixuvri, you mentioned you were going to talk with the regulatory agencies in Europe about moving from OS to PFS in terms of the endpoint. Can you characterize how much discussion you think that might take? And then the second, can you -- when we talk about your JAK2 inhibitor, there is a discussion generally with investors, there's a discussion generally about the GI AEs. Can you talk about how did those -- the AEs were managed in prior trials and how you're characterizing -- or how you're managing those side effects in the ongoing trials? Because I think there's a little bit of a question as -- in investors' minds as how they've been handled previously and how they will be handled going forward."," I'm going to actually ask Steve to address both of those questions with respect to the process for scientific advice, and since he's closest to the data under GI AEs and how they're managed.",,,,,,
Robert Cummins Hazlett,Steven E. Benner," Would you like it to be an iterative process? Will you go back and forth, or is it potentially a one and done?"," I think the initial discussions will probably be with the rapporteur, and then we'll follow his guidance in terms of what subsequent discussions we should have with the agency more broadly.",,,,,,
Robert Cummins Hazlett,Steven E. Benner," And because of the endpoint change, would there be any potential for the data to come any earlier?"," We would hope so because if we were able to switch to progression-free survival, it leaves with substantial decrease in sample size from 350 down to the range of 200, 220. That would still make this a very large trial in this disease, in this patient population. So it would still be a very robust data set. And we're going to be in the process, as we said, about getting additional EU sites now that we're also launching the drug commercially in the EU, and hoping that those EU sites will help us boost accruals so that we could complete the study more quickly than under the current design. With regards to the GI adverse events, the most common side effects are diarrhea, the second is nausea. These GI side effects tend to occur within the first month of treatment. So 89% of the patients that have been exposed to pacritinib had experienced some diarrhea within the first month. Because there's an opportunity to assess early, these patients. And in the clinical protocols, the patients will be contacted by their sites and asked, if they're using a formal script, whether or not there's any change in the GI symptoms. And that will allow the sites to give them specific instructions with regards to what additional medications they will take. It will also be given at the time they start the medication, a prescription for IMODIUM or some comparable anti-diarrheal, and with the instructions to start taking that medication in the event that they have any problems. So those patients whom the clinicians are concerned about, if the possible risk of diarrhea might seem to be higher or the responsiveness of the patients to taking medicine might be decreased, those patients could be instructed to take the IMODIUM prophylactically just as they start the therapy. This kind of aggressive management was not done in Phase I, understandably, because it was trying to elucidate the toxicity profile of the drug overall. So it's only as you get to the Phase II experience that you start to see a difference in terms of the presentation of GI side effects. The most recent example we have from publication would be the lymphoma study that is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September in which patients with lymphoma were dosed with pacritinib up to 600 milligrams, well above our 400-milligram per day dose in myelofibrosis. No Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicities were observed. So the GI toxicity is predictable. It's on target due to FLT3 and it's well managed by standard agents that the clinicians and patients are both very familiar with.",,,,,,
Reni J. Benjamin,James A. Bianco," Maybe just starting off with Pixuvri, Jim. Can you talk a little bit about the sales force that you have in place? Is it optimal for Europe? And if not, how to best leverage? Is it just increasing the sales force, how do you best leverage forces out there to maximize the potential of revenues in Europe for 2013? And then just related to the previous question regarding PFS, just help me -- just remind me, I thought OS was decided as a prime [indiscernible] will no longer be used for [indiscernible]."," I'll toss it over to Steve [indiscernible].  We currently have 19 people in the field. That includes 5 sales people, a country manager and an MSL in Germany, with 2 additional, what we call, key account managers, coming into Germany in the second week of March. We have a field complement that covers the Nordics and the Netherlands. And then we have a field complement in the U.K. And obviously, we wouldn't put people into territories where we don't have big access pricing. With respect to is it enough critical mass, the answer is this product is very promotionally sensitive. Salespeople, unlike in the U.S., is the #4 source of information for physicians in Europe that influences their treatment practices, coming right behind like journal ads and symposia. So they play a very important role. These are very advanced degree individuals, typically Ph.D.'s, Pharm D's or M.D.'s in the case of MSLs. And we have seen that as we have [indiscernible] into the field complement, because as you may recall, what we talked about in the fourth quarter, while we may have hired these folks under German law, for example, they need a 90-day waiting period before they can start and we work that into our timeline. So a lot of these folks have started out of the gate, January 1, and again, with some of the complement coming on in early March. So the answer is we think we have the right [indiscernible] with total by the end of the first quarter in the field. It doesn't include the 3 leadership positions that we have in terms of the General Manager, market access folks, et cetera. So from that perspective, again, when we say it's promotionally sensitive, we see that directly in terms of call frequency and then orders that come in behind that. Just one other note to give you a sense in Germany. In Germany, there's a process whereby the hospitals, when they're interested in the product, they can apply to the payers' systems, have it put on what would essentially be like formulary here in the U.S. Of the 2,000 hospitals in Germany, we targeted only the top 200 where the majority of the lymphoma patients are treated. And of those 200 hospitals, after seeing just a one-sheet product profile for Pixuvri, 146 of them applied to the regulatory agencies for formulary requests. So we're encouraged, we think we have the right complement now. And as sales start to ramp up, and importantly, when we get pricing decisions, then obviously, we'll implement the second half of the year, the additional sales personnel to try to make this a successful launch.

Reni J. Benjamin,James A. Bianco," I guess just related to that, Jim -- sorry, just before we get to Steve, what are -- any thoughts regarding securing a marketing partner in Europe? And I guess this is another way of asking, has Novartis sort of just backed out of their option for taking over Pixuvri in Europe?"," Let me put it in this way. We know that Novartis has, internally, a threshold for a product to have to have at least $500 million in sales before they would consider it a product that they would take to market. So clearly, we've never considered Pixuvri in the EU to be a $500 million marketed product, so it would not be surprising that Novartis would not want to take it forward in the EU. And then obviously, with respect to other partners, as I've mentioned in the script, we have been forming and will continue to form channel partners. In Turkey, we have an existing one, and we'll have one in Israel. There are mid- to large-sized pharma that have interest in taking Pixuvri in rest of world. So into Eastern Europe, China, the Pac Rim, India, South America, et cetera. And so those are the things that can -- I'll turn it over to Matt and give you a little bit more color on that since it's been his primary driver for the first half of the year, that and the PIX deal -- the PAC deal.",,,,,,
Reni J. Benjamin,James A. Bianco," Okay, great. And then just switching gears to -- you mentioned in several scientific meetings where data will be presented. Can you potentially spell out? Would it be at ACR, ASCO, ASH? Do you know -- have these abstracts been submitted already? And will we see any follow-up studies or follow-up data or long-term data from the Phase II trials of pacritinib?"," Information abstracts have been submitted to a variety of meetings throughout the year. Certainly, the biggest ones, both in the hem space and in the solid tumors space for both pacritinib and Pixuvri, so -- and tosedostat and OPAXIO. So I think you'll see some visibility on that in the future as those meetings come together.",,,,,,
Reni J. Benjamin,James A. Bianco," Okay. And any -- will the pacritinib data, will that be further follow-up data from the ongoing Phase II trials, or will it be more preclinical, exploring the drug in indications like AML?"," Steve, do you want to just briefly -- generally talk about what kind of -- obviously, there's no new data, not any new clinical trial data. But Steve will tell you on the rest.",,,,,,
