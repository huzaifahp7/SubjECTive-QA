Charles Strauzer,Thomas J. Quinlan," Tom, if you could, let's talk a little bit about the cost reduction efforts going into this year. And obviously, in the past few years or so, you've taken a significant amount of cost out, but a lot of that was driven by some fairly large acquisitions. Now absent those acquisitions, what gives you confidence you can find additional costs to take out, kind of offsetting those revenue declines?"," Charlie, fair question. Let me go back a little bit to give you sort of a foundation from which -- why we think we can still do what we've continued to do since we've gotten here in 2004. There's a number of reasons to be optimistic about 2013. The U.S. economy's recovery seems to be getting stronger. The overall financial health of corporates continues to stabilize. There's a little bit more certainty in D.C. The housing market recovery is continuing. There's a low interest rate environment, and funds our available. Banks are lending. And the energy sector seems to be improving. But for us, the most optimistic reason for '13 is our plan and how we're continuing to transform RR Donnelley. We're selling more of the products and services in our portfolio to our customers, but we also are creating sound solutions to our customers that draw in more of the products and services in our portfolio. Along this communications management supply chain, there's content origination, content management and content delivery. We play a role in content origination with the capabilities that Helium brings to the platform, and we excel at content management and content delivery. We have the capabilities, credibility and capacity to be the primary player in the communication management services chain. We are continuing to go to market, as I said, to be multifaceted with the approach that we talked about, the 4 approach. We're focused on selling individual products and services across all verticals. We're leveraging the existing RR Donnelley platform to provide bundled solutions for current customers and prospects. We're delivering integrated solutions to target industry verticals, and the supply chain management opportunities that we talked about, I don't want anybody to lose focus on that. For both our existing and as well as new prospects, we will compete with external market players. We have grown the supply chain management significantly since the year-end 2010. Existing players in this area are facing challenges with the current business model, so there's a lot of opportunities there for us. All of this leads us to not to be solely dependent upon our long-run print products and gives us the ability to assist customers in their communication needs while we're lowering their overall cost and improving their customers' return on the spend. No question some long-run products are eroding, but at the same time, Charlie, these products and services, they're not going to go away. And we are participating in some of the things that we talked about that are asset-light. That wasn't the case a couple of years ago. What I talked about on the supply chain management side, what we're doing, those electronic devices didn't exist a couple of years ago. And we're doing about $0.5 billion in that area. So I think the long-run products are eroding, but they're not going away. That's going to help us. From an overall platform cost standpoint, what does this mean? We still have the ability to match costs to revenues. The transformation evolution of the business allows us to continue to take out costs to match revenues. What's interesting for me to see in the marketplace when other customers -- I'm sorry, other companies are talking about their cost-saving targets that they've achieved, they have achieved those targets, but they've seen those costs eaten up by a decline in their base business. Our platform is far from reaching that point, so I want to make sure that's emphasized today, that we've still got the ability to match costs to revenues in this platform as we continue to evolve.",,,,,,
Charles Strauzer,Thomas J. Quinlan," So what you're saying, basically, in a nutshell, you've got some additional capacity that could come offline if you needed to pull that lever.", You said it in 2 seconds. I said it in about 10 minutes. Yes.,,,,,,
Charles Strauzer,Daniel N. Leib," Shifting gears a little bit, if we look at the performance in Q4, it's definitely better than, I think, myself and the industry were expecting there in terms of the revenue and profitability. As the quarter progressed, what were the areas that kind of stood out for you in terms of the outperformers versus where you thought they might be."," Yes, sure. Particularly, if we look at what performed better in Q4 to Q3, magazine/catalog retail was up in Q4, and in all these figures we're going to exclude any impact of M&A, FX or paper, and variable print offering, which includes our direct mail. And our short-run fulfillment and our statement printing was also up in Q4 after being down in Q3. So that was up about 20 basis points. Magazine/catalog retail, up about 110. You look at logistics, which was better in Q4 than Q3. Office products continued growth in Q4 of about 5%, which is consistent with what they did in Q3. Premedia showed about 3% growth. And then on the international side, we did see a very strong performance in China, up about 13%, which was off of a Q3 which was up about 1% or so, and Latin America, which is a bit of the timing influence, but was much stronger in Q4 as well. I think as it relates to the financial offering, the number of IPOs priced were flat in Q4 but certainly saw some progress coming towards the tail end of Q4 and also, obviously, into the first quarter of 2013.",,,,,,
Charles Strauzer,Thomas J. Quinlan," Excellent. And then just one final question for you, Tom. Just when you look at the -- some of the speculation over the last few months about the dividend, can you give us any comments about that?"," Yes, there's been a lot of speculation about the dividend for awhile now. I'll let Dan start that one, then I'll jump in.",,,,,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Thomas J. Quinlan," A couple of questions. First, on some of the events this quarter. I mean, first was the Meredith transaction. It would be great if you could tell us how that impacts you. And secondly, the news about USPS stopping the Saturday delivery. I mean, does that have a big impact on you at all? And if you could give us some color around that."," Yes, we could. On the Meredith transaction, look, I think as you go -- as everyone goes through it today, you continue to see, as I talked about earlier, strategics looking to combine to take advantage of scale and take advantage of synergies. I think we're at that phase of the recovery. So we're -- as we sit here today, as you look at our platform, we are able to serve customers that are in that way. I think the bigger news here is what you said on your second question, when you want to go ahead and talk about postal. And just to frame that question a little bit to see why we're excited about our logistics business, if you think about what the USPS has gone through since 2006, they've basically reduced 200,000 employees. They've consolidated 200 mailing centers, and they've reduced hours in 13,000 post offices. Any of these actions that we, as business leaders in the world, if we would have took them, then we thought we would have seen great results of taking such restructuring. But it hasn't occurred, and not to put blame on the post office, not to put blame on the United States government, but society has evolved in how we communicate with each other. But now is the time to address it. None of us can simply ignore the problem that the post office is faced with. The industry accounts for 8 million jobs and is roughly 7% of our GDP. It has a significant impact on our economy. All of us can look at the post office's pre-funding of the retirement benefits, and I think it's $5.5 million annually they have to pay to the Treasury. You can point to the United States Postal Service overpaying its obligation to the Civil Service Retirement System by $50 billion, while the $7 billion overfunded to the Federal Employees Retirement System. All of these 3 are valid areas impacting the financial health of the United States Postal Service. But what can get done about it? I mean, the USPS is, by far, the best delivery mechanism, most cost-effective for less mile. USPS touches every household business and institution on a daily basis, and it is a trusted brand. So that's sort of the backdrop. Where there's challenges, there's opportunities, and for us, we're uniquely positioned to assist customers to deliver their communications from both a physical and electronic standpoint. RR Donnelley handles the sorting, transportation, and we've got an unparalleled logistics network. We already touch more than half of the standard mail in this country. So the answer is not whether or not we fix the overpayments that the post office has made or whether we go 6 to 5 days. It's going to be how can USPS have a step change and even operate even more efficiently than it does today, and that is where we think RR Donnelley's opportunity is. Our logistics is -- when you consider the actions that's going to be taken over the next 2 years by the USPS, coupled with all the communication material and packaging we have running through our facilities, our logistics business even becomes more important to RR Donnelley and our investors. We are well positioned to assist the USPS in their transformation and, at the same time, help our customers. The acquisition that we did that we talked to you about, the commingling facility, those acquisitions, that's what we're going to continue to look for because we've got to continue to look to mitigate the cost increases for our customers. If the USPS gives all of our industry time to go ahead and figure out 6 to 5 days, we're all going to figure it out. But if not, then we think our platform is better situated if it does come upon us quicker than people might expect, which our competitors might not be in the same spot.",,,,,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Thomas J. Quinlan," I guess overall, I guess, you don't expect any material revenue impact on either of these fronts?"," No, not at all.",,,,,,
Kannan Venkateshwar,Thomas J. Quinlan," Okay. And beyond that, in terms of the debt maturities, given the strength of the high-yield markets right now, is there any plan to term out the debt that's coming due next year, or what's the plan for the debt ladder as it exists today?"," Well, I think as you've seen us over the last couple of years -- and as I just mentioned, I think Dan and his team have done a tremendous job of making sure that we've got a nice runway here with this company to make sure that we're able to operate and that we've got no big tower that's going to come and choke us. So again, we look at it every day. We see what's out there. If the market conditions exist, we will entertain it.",,,,,,
Scott Wipperman,Daniel N. Leib," Just a couple here. The first is, Dan, with the $80 million payment that you're going to get from the international subsidiaries, I think that's down from $150 million you talked about last quarter. So I guess I was just trying to understand the difference. Also, if you could just let us know the timing of that, and has the total amount changed that you guys expect to get? And I got a couple of follow-ups."," Yes, sure. So the short answer, the total amount has not changed. The $80 million versus the $150 million is just reflective of where the cash was at the end of the year, so we actually had that $70 million loan back to the U.S. at the end of the year and -- or I should say, had $70 million, so it's just an incremental $80 million on top of that, so the $150 million is the $150 million, and the overall amount remains the near $500 million.",,,,,,
Scott Wipperman,Daniel N. Leib," Got it, okay. And then did you make any changes to your discount rate or return assumptions for the pension?"," Yes. So return assumptions, we dropped to 8%, and the discount rate, the blended discount rate was down 70 basis points. And so as mentioned, on pension alone, a 100 basis point increase would increase our funding by $640 million on pension alone and an additional $50 million or so on the postretirement plan.",,,,,,
Scott Wipperman,Thomas J. Quinlan," And then, I guess, Tom, can you just discuss the rationale for the lower leverage target? I mean, I obviously heard the comments earlier, so I appreciate that. But if you could maybe just kind of provide a little bit more color on the move. And then I know in the past, the leverage target has had a little bit of flexibility, with the statement that you could be above or below that target at any one time. I guess if you could just provide how we should be thinking about the new one of 2 to 2.25, 2.75. And then I just have one follow-up as well."," Sure. I think if you -- some of the things that we talked about this morning, our business is not as capital-intensive as it used to be. And I think that's the same for all of our competitors. So I think there's one place where you're not going to see our CapEx go beyond where it is today. I mean, if asset-light is becoming more and more. We've got $1 billion that we outsource today that, quite frankly, we don't believe we get credit from investors on the equity side for what we're doing there from a sourcing standpoint that we provide to our customers within our bundled approach. So we feel pretty good as far as what our outflows are going to be as it relates to capital expenditures. I think the deals that are out there today or that could be out there today in our marketplace, from where we sit, from our position of strength, we believe they'd be delevering deals at this point. As we've provided, again, that the property that we're looking at is someone that has the characteristics that we look for, whether it's cost, capacity or customers. We think right now that those transactions that would be there would not result in, long term, going past the guardrails that we've proposed to you today. So in the past, I've told you -- we've said, hey, it could go up or it could go down. Yes, that always could be the case, but this is where -- we never want to be a group that tells you that we're doing something that we can't do. A number of you had criticized me for not saying why aren't you going to be at 2 to 2.5. And we will eventually, at some point in time in our lifetime, we'll get there. But right now, I think that the best way for us to operate this particular platform is that we gradually bring it down, and I think we've demonstrated to you again, like we've demonstrated to you other things that we've said we'd do, we follow through on that. So as we sit here today, we think that will be -- that's the right target for us and where we're headed.",,,,,,
Scott Wipperman,Thomas J. Quinlan," Great. And then maybe just the last one is for the guidance for the year. I mean, if we just assume the economy ranges the same, which I know is a big assumption, but if you could just maybe walk through like which of your segments or end markets or regions, which in your mind is the biggest swing factor this year, either beating or missing that guidance? What should we be focused on? What are you focused on?"," Dan will take you through that, but the one thing I want to also emphasize, as you think about the economy and what Dan Knotts, George Zengo, the rest of the team -- look, a tough economy should be a good day for RR Donnelley because our customers are going to continue to look to get costs out of their platform. We don't change the way we run the business no matter what's going on with the economy, but hopefully, our customers will be able to show them the impact that we can bring to their platform as a result of the cost savings we can give to them, how we can improve their return on their investments and how we can make their market communications more powerful for what they're doing, so...",,,,,,
Patrick C. Wang,Thomas J. Quinlan," This is Patrick Wang for Dan Leben this morning. So most of my questions have been addressed already, but going back to the topic of margins, could you just talk a little about how you view the balance between margin improvement, but at the same time investing in innovation and the IT spend, as you touched on earlier, relating to NFC and the digital initiatives as you look to replace some of the print revenues?"," Yes, sure. I mean, we, as you know and those of you who have been around us for a while, we've got a group up in Grand Island, New York that does a tremendous job as it relates to R&D and innovation in our industry. We've talked to you in the past about how we have developed the ProteusJet press, which, again, we're not going to manufacture those presses. We've got people that will manufacture for us. But we've got that type of jewels that are out there that allow us to go ahead and make our productivity that much better. From an IT standpoint, again, as you look at our CapEx number, we're significantly investing in IT. Ken O'Brien and his team are going ahead and looking for and making sure that we can go ahead and serve our customers' needs as it relates to their Information Technology. Everything's about data, how can you get the data, how can you make it more efficient. We'll build where we have to build. We'll buy where it makes more sense to buy. All of those things together allow us to go ahead and have the productivity to improve our margins.",,,,,,
Edward J. Atorino,Thomas J. Quinlan," Do you see any new competitive pressures anywhere, from Quad, for example, which is much bigger than it used to be, in some of your businesses?"," As you know, we don't talk about competitors here. But what I would tell you is, without talking about anybody, there's no one that has the capabilities that we talked about today. There's no one that can go ahead and serve people along the communication supply chain like we can. We've got the integrated communication products and services that's going to make our customers more efficient, more powerful and enable them to target their customers more. There's nobody else out there that can do that. It's not about ink on paper like it was a number of years ago. It's about how are you going to allow me to reach my customer on a daily basis at the right time with the right information in the right medium. It could be physical. It could be electronic. That's what we're excited about, what we've built, which we -- as I sit here today, again, I don't believe anybody else has that capability to close the circle to say how do you want to go ahead and reach out to your customer. If you want to reach out physical, you go to one person. You want to reach out electronic, you go to another person. If you want to do it underneath one roof, you come to RR Donnelley.",,,,,,
Edward J. Atorino,Daniel N. Leib," In the magazine/catalog, book catalog, book carrier, could you isolate? Were they all up? Were 2 out of 3 up, 1 out of 3 up?"," Yes. So magazine/catalog retail was up. The book directory continues to be a bit challenged. Expectations on '13 is that we will not see a large adoption rolling into '13. So we'd expect a pretty similar performance. We obviously know the successes that we've had on the sales side and what will be coming onto the platform in '13, and so we feel good about that.",,,,,,
