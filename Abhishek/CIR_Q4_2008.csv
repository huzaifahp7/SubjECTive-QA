Charlie Brady,Bill Higgins," Hey, thanks. With respect to the backlog, can you give us a sense of how far out each of the segments had to stretch? I mean, are we stretching out full-year of ’09? And then, I guess, if you can give us a sense of – within that backlog, particularly on energy, the mix of that business, have you seen a change with some of that mix as you go into ’09 and what that might do to margins?"," Well, let me point out on the backlog that we have, due to the makeup of the various businesses we have across Circor, we have a mix of what I think of as short-cycle, medium-cycle, and long-cycle backlog elements. So, if I focus on energy, that applies as well to the segments. From a standpoint of the large projects, which are longer-cycle orders and backlog, we have a pretty good run at the first half and going into the third quarter of this year. In the shorter-cycle business or the gas – let me try the medium-cycle business, which might be the fabricated business we manufacture in North America, we also have a pretty good backlog going into the first half of this year. The shorter-cycle business, by definition, within a quarter is all the visibility we have. That applies as well to some of the other business units where, for example, in our navy business as well as in our aerospace applications, we have backlog that goes at least through the first half of 2009.",,,,,,
Charlie Brady,Bill Higgins," Can you give us a sense of how much of that backlog is the longer business, long or medium-term backlog?"," Most of it is the longer-term backlog. We have a percentage breakout, but it’s – by definition, the short-cycle backlog turns over very quickly.",,,,,,
Charlie Brady,Bill Higgins," Okay. In terms of mix that’s in there, in terms of the specific product, has there been any meaningful mix that might impact the margin now? The margins in Q4 and Q3 were pretty stellar, and I guess I’m trying to look at sustainability aside from just absorption issues, just on a mix issue, what that margin impact might be."," We did ship a number of project-related valves and other equipment to very high-profit mix projects in the second half of the year of 2008, and we don’t expect that necessarily to continue in 2009. The mix will probably shift to a more normal mix that we’ve seen in prior years for the project business.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," I’m just trying to really determine, like the previous caller, just where we end up in energy for the year. I'm looking back kind of at your historical book-to-bill ratios, your historical backlog bills and drawdown, and I’m just – I know this is a crystal ball you don’t have or anybody has, but if we assume the energy markets in large-project activity remain at the current rate, I think you got a backlog of $172 million. You did $331 million in orders in 2008. And it strikes me, if you cut it a couple of different ways, either matching your backlog plus some orders as your revenue for this year or matching total orders of $330 million to revenue this year, your energy revenue is going to be plus or minus in the $300 million range, down from the $408 million you did this year. Is that the right way to think about it or are there other moving parts that we should bear in mind?"," I think the difficulty, as you mentioned, is making the assumptions that the current rates hold. We’ve had a lot of discussion, we’ve talked to a lot of customers, we’ve had teams in the Middle East, and there is quite a bit of quotation activity out there. It’s very difficult for us to determine what that will translate into as we get into the second and third quarter. We do have the ability if we book quotes in the first and second quarter, the capacity and the throughput to convert those quotes in the second half of the year. So, it’s a real wildcard right now.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Fred Burditt," So, what is your utilization rate in the Italian plant right now for large ball valves?"," Well, it’s still fairly high because we entered the year with pretty strong backlogs from the first half.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," Okay. And to the pricing question again, you mentioned you’ve got re-quoting going on within the backlog. What type of deflation rates are you seeing on existing backlog?"," It’s not within the backlog, it’s new quotes. So, these are quotes that are out for bid today, which would fill in the second half of year and go into 2010.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," Okay. But I did not hear you correctly, Bill, did you mention it was re-quoting going on?"," Yes, re-quoting or quoting? This would be activity that we’ve had out there that has not been released orders, that has been quoted a second time.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," Okay. Well, same question. If you take quote A versus quote A1, what type of deflation are you seeing in the quoting?"," I don’t have any answer to that question, Mike.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Fred Burditt,Are we talking 3% or 30%?,Definitely more towards the former.,,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," Okay. When you mentioned there is project delays, we’ve heard that across the energy space, have you seen specific cancellations within your backlog that would’ve flowed through this quarter?"," It’s in more delays. We have not in the – even in the gas pipeline markets, we haven’t seen it in our specific applications.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins," Okay. And then, just in the HVAC space, I’m curious about the comment that made your building and commercial construction to slow down. I guess I didn’t appreciate that steam projects or steam products are being used in many of these new commercial towers. I had thought your business at Leslie and expense [ph] on these companies where it's primarily aftermarket for the existing municipal heating systems."," Most of it is. The lion share of it is, what I call, the install base model. But when you think about the capital spending that’s gone on in university campuses in the last ten years or hospitals or other buildings where they’ve added on wings or new buildings onto the steam loop system, we would have sold products into those buildings. So, there’s a project element of it that was pretty robust up until about the middle of last year.",,,,,,
Mike Schneider,Bill Higgins,Okay.," But that would be on top of, I don’t know, 60%, 70% base business.",,,,,,
