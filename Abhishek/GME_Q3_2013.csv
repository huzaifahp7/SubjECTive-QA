Brian W. Nagel,J. Paul Raines," So my first question, just want to dive a little deeper into the used margin in the quarter. you gave some commentary in your prepared remarks, but just want to understand the mechanics. Is the pressure of the margin, does that come as you're making -- as you're actually taking these trade-ins? Or does it come when you subsequently sell that product? And then the decision to get more aggressive on, I guess, on the trade-in effort, was that planned ahead of time? Or was it potentially a response to maybe something you've seen in the competitive environment?"," Let me start off with sort of the plans and then Rob should go through some of the map on used margin rate. But then Tony may have some comments for you, Brian. I mean, we've -- one of the things that's very important to us is to have high share on these consoles. Our company has been through several of these. We know the importance of the cycle. So going back over a year, we have wanted to maximize trying to get more allocation every day from the console makers. For that reason, we have been focused on trade promotion for quite a while here, trying to get people into our reservation file and our first-to-know list. So I would say this has been something we've been going at a while. And as shared data becomes more apparent, we have to let Sony and Microsoft lead on that, but I think investors will see how dominant GameStop truly is on these launches. And that's really been going on for a while. A reaction, really not much of a reaction here. You really can't react short term, Tony, fair to say?",,,,,,
Brian W. Nagel,Robert A. Lloyd," Got it. And then so as a follow-up to that, Rob, you mentioned in your prepared comments, it was, I think -- correct me if I'm wrong. You said in the fourth quarter, you should see that used margin snap back to the more -- the normal levels. So does that then suggest you're going to -- you're changing the prices, which you take trade-ins or you work through the inventory? Or basically, how should we think about the puts and takes of that?"," Well, again, as we've always said about our pre-owned inventory program, we have control of the buy side and the sell side pricing on that. So as far as what we do going forward, it'll be a combination of both of those levers, if you will, that will have us return more to the normal range that we've always had.",,,,,,
Brian W. Nagel,J. Paul Raines,I just have one more question. I'll turn it over to someone else. But you've taken a lot of trade-in from the pre-owned -- on the pre-owned machines in anticipation of the launches of the new machines. How should we think about that relative -- in conjunction with kind of the weaker sales and use that?," Maybe you want to say we, certainly, have a lot of faith in the used business in a new console cycle. Maybe, Mike Hogan, you want to share what the history tells us about pre-owned in a new cycle?",,,,,,
Colin A. Sebastian,J. Paul Raines," A quick follow-up on the pre-owned margin questions, it sounds like there's a cyclical element to this. And I think I asked about this in the last call, but why wouldn't it be logical to assume that the pre-owned margins remain a bit lower for a period of time at least just given the mix shift to higher-value next-gen software where maybe that having both sides of the trade doesn't give you as much flexibility? And then secondly, Paul, back to the comments on technology retail and leveraging your assets, that brings up the point of Simply Mac, which I don't think you mentioned in the script. But curious if there's any interest in acquiring the remainder of that company. And then more broadly, if you can talk about synergies beyond the back office between GameStop, Spring, Aio and Simply Mac, perhaps sharing footprint or floor space or anything like that."," Maybe, Rob, do you want to -- or you and Mike want to talk about the cyclicality of the margin rate? I'm not -- the one comment I would make on it, Colin, is it's all about the consumer size. It's not a fixed consumer base. People come into the category as it drives innovation, and that plays a big role. But anything you want to add to that?",,,,,,
Michael J. Olson,J. Paul Raines," There was some discussion earlier about the relationship between new and used sales at the beginning of a console cycle. And I think in the last cycle, you saw pre-owned sales increase by something like more than 20% in the first couple of years of the cycle. Is there anything different about this cycle or anything you can say about what we should expect for pre-owned growth as we look into 2014 and '15?"," Yes, let's let Mike take you through some of his thoughts on that because he's done a lot of modeling. I would also encourage you to remember that PowerUp Rewards is a bit of a game changer on this, and it's demonstrated some really different behaviors in terms of our ability to gain share of wallet. But Mike, you want to talk about that?",,,,,,
Michael J. Olson,J. Paul Raines," Okay. And then are you experiencing more mobile competition that could impact that business? I know there continues to be some new entrants in the space from time to time. Were you pressured to do more aggressive promotions there, which may have impacted mobile margins because of more competition in the space? Or were you just doing them to kind of drive share gains?"," I'll let Tony -- Tony runs that business for us but I would -- one comment I would make about the mobile business is we were early in that. There are a lot of new entrants into it, but we continue to be uniquely positioned in terms of our retail footprint and our refurbishment capabilities. And our play is how do we continue to leverage that and bundle it with video game promotions. But Tony, you want to talk about mobile promotions and trades and so forth?",,,,,,
Arvind Bhatia,J. Paul Raines," Just a couple of questions here, guys. One, I wanted to see if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing in tie ratios for the PlayStation 4 so far and maybe compare that to what you saw early on either for the 360 or the PlayStation 3. And then also, the 20% to 30% industry growth guidance you guys -- or not guidance but how you guys think about the industry for next year, is there any change in your thought process? Are you guys more comfortable with that kind of number as you now have more visibility? And then I have a follow-up."," Rob, you want to take the tie ratio question?",,,,,,
Arvind Bhatia,J. Paul Raines," I just -- we heard some stories where some of the recent big launches like Call of Duty, et cetera, Battlefield, they were trending initially down as, I think, it was -- assume that consumers were delaying purchases for the next gen. I just wanted to see if you guys have any thoughts on how you see the full picture for the quarter, meaning you have the $9.99 upgrade program, when we combine existing gen and next-gen sales of some of the big properties this holiday quarter, how you see the trend."," Yes. Tony will talk a little bit about what he's doing with trades and all. I would just say that there's a lot of noise in the business right now. We're launching Xbox One tonight. There's a lot of customers. I talk to a lot of gamers, a lot of gamers trying to make decisions. They have so many options. So there's a little bit of noise in the system. Tony, what do you want to add to that?",,,,,,
Curtis Nagle,J. Paul Raines," Just one question and a quick follow-up. Frankly, I was pretty surprised by the amount of leverage you guys got in the quarter. Of course, sales were quite good, but just on the dollar basis, they virtually were unchanged given a very big increase in sales. And just was wondering what the puts and takes were and kind of how we should think about leverage going into 4Q. And then just a follow-up, I was curious why digital sales weren't stronger just given the number of AAA titles, particularly GTA that sold and the high attach rates that go with them. So if you could comment that -- on that, it'd be very much appreciated."," Why don't we start -- Tony, why don't you take the digital question first.",,,,,,
Anthony C. Chukumba,J. Paul Raines," Just wanted to probe a little bit into the Q4 guidance because it looked -- it just struck me as very, very conservative. I mean, particularly on the comp, 2% to 9%, I mean, you're going to be selling a ton of these PlayStation 4 and Xbox Ones at $300, $400. And so I guess, I'm just trying to dig a little bit into that because, like I said, I definitely get the mix in terms of the margins and obviously, the consoles are significantly lower margin. But I guess, that just struck me as conservative, particularly from a comp perspective."," Yes. Rob will give you some detail. I mean, we are -- the fourth quarter, there's lots of movement, there are some title shifts. There's 53, 52 week. We did launch the Wii U last year. It was a pretty successful launch. So there's a few things there. Rob, maybe you want to give him some detail -- Anthony some detail on how you model Q4.",,,,,,
Anthony C. Chukumba,Robert A. Lloyd," Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, sort of related, just to clarify the -- you're assuming 118 million diluted shares outstanding for Q4. So that essentially assumes that you don't repurchase any stock in Q4? Is that correct?"," As is typical, when we give guidance, we base it on the share count that calculates off the quarter we just completed. So that's consistent, yes.",,,,,,
Anthony C. Chukumba,Robert A. Lloyd," Okay, and then -- I mean, but just based on the fact you just re-upped your share repurchase program, there's no reason to think that you wouldn't buy back stock in Q4. I mean, is there?"," Well, no, we're committed to the buyback program. Re-upping the authorization is, obviously, a symbol of that. However, as we go into a quarter given what the price might do and there's been some volatility in it this year, it's tough for us to predict exactly what we might buy in terms of share count. So our practice has been, over the course of the past 3 years, just to base it on what we know has been completed.",,,,,,
David G. Magee,J. Paul Raines," The interest in the new consoles is very encouraging and the -- I guess, the discounts that we also have attached to it versus the last cycle launch may not have been warranted. I'm curious, as you look out 6 to 9 months from now, when you get through this initial gamer-centric demand, how do you feel about the visibility of the console demand at that point in time past the initial rush? Are you feeling better about that at this point? Or it's just hard to say?"," Mike is going to give you some modeling sort of stuff. I would just tell you plain, the PS4, you can't help but think about the innovation level in that device as being around for a long time. Just all the social features, you stream PlayStation live, all that stuff is really compelling. Mike -- that's just an anecdotal qualitative kind of thing. But Mike, what do you want to share with about that?",,,,,,
