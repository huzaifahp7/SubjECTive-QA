Michael Cherny,Mike Valentine," Somewhat dig in a little bit for this bookings number, Mike you already talked about number of large contract wins talk about some new competitive situations, specially large contract wins, were these more green field opportunities or replacements of legacy systems or kind of gives a little more characteristics of what that some of these contract wins."," Well I think Michael at a high level it's a result of an ongoing investment it's the investment that we have made in the specifically the two transaction that I think you are referring to UHS and Tenet a longer-term investment in the four profits base and developing a business on that front. Both of them had levels of HIT automation in place both had some other suppliers in the mix with different strategies. So I think that but there is a large tool it's a result of some longer-term investments that paid off. The just a sheer volume of larger transactions I think is reflective of combination of new footprints coming to the marketplace. Existing clients finishing their journey and our catering percent of spend strategies coming to provision. So the average transaction is larger obviously, what we can define more of the roadmap and to get more of the stand at that transaction point. So, I think this quarter represented a great example of all that coming together at once.",,,,,,
Michael Cherny,Marc Naughton," Absolutely, and then just question on the margin. It kind of relates to the first question as well. Obviously, I think once you're excited to see that guys broke through that 20% operating margin, but then going forward obviously a lot of new business to put in place. Could you tell us a little bit about the dynamics of the trade-off between some of the significant new business wins you have and what that means for the margin profile of the overall business?"," Yeah, this is Marc. The deals that we signed this quarter were very consistent from a pricing perspective. We're not seeing a lot of pricing pressure out there. We kind of winning on our capabilities, and this will feed not only the software but feed to the services. And a lot of these are having elective services yet are future candidates for that. So, we don't expect any degradation to our margins and in the fact as we full utilize what we talked about as a bench in the services space, we actually think that will could be positive relative to our margin and help us get to a 20% margin for the full-year of 2010.",,,,,,
Glenn Garmont,Marc Naughton," Marc, just trying to understand the relationship here between that very impressive bookings number and your revenue growth guidance for this year and I'm just wondering obviously significant upside on the booking side, 10% revenue growth outlook sort of consistent with where its been. What's preventing sort of greater flow through there are you sort of constrained on the implementation side or is it the mix of bookings, are there more services in the booking, just trying to understand sort of a linkage there."," Yeah, good question. Clearly some of the mix relative to some of the longer-term deals from a hosting and IT works perspective, those being the income statement over longer period of time normally 5 to 7 years. So that's one impact. Some of these larger transactions particularly in the forward profits base probably have projects will go on over period of years and the professional services from those will flow into the income statement over that three plus year period of time. So, obviously the big chunk of bookings very excited puts in their backlog as we roll forward it certainly helps support the view we have had for 2010 but keep in mind we try to be somewhat conservative on doing our plans relative to expecting more business then we kind of see in the past and I think this year we have been even more careful just to make sure that our numbers are solid and deliverable. So, in this economy we would be pleased with 10% growth of the top line 17% growth on the earnings line and we haven't factored in a whole lot of upside from stimulus and the numbers been provided that could happen. But, relative to the big booking of Q4 is going to have a multi year impact and that's why you are not seeing a huge amount of flow through in 2010.",,,,,,
Richard Close,Marc Naughton," Just quick clarification, Mark on that last statement, did you say you have not factored in a lot of stimulus?"," We built our plan based on kind of our 2009 activity levels adjusted slightly for pipeline so there is likely stimulus that's kind of in the middle of the year, end of the year we expect that there is potential for upside, we think Q1 as our guidance indicates relatively Q4 is going to reflect some of the seasonality that we normally encounter and obviously after a monster Q4 down slightly for Q1 numbers would make sense from our booking standpoint but our plan and that's what we base our guidance on going into the year doesn't expect anything heroic from a stimulus prospective.",,,,,,
Richard Close,Mike Valentine,When we look at the $15-$10 plus million deals how many of those would you characterize were from new footprints and stop there.," This is Mike, I would say about a third and we are not in our calculation we may do the 30 plus percent from new business we are not including Tenet and not even though all those technically represent new foot print facilities where those that's excluded from our calculations",,,,,,
Richard Close,Mike Valentine," Final, on the pipeline when you look out can you characterize at all stimulus related deals and have you seemed to pick up yet I mean based on your initial comments Marc, I guess you are really not factoring much in until later in the year, but are there active, increase in active RFPs because of the stimulus?"," Yeah, this is Mike again. There are absolutely as an increase in RFP traffic, and the increase in activities in the market place. So we're like we've said in the last three calls now, we're seeing different behavior in the market place, that's driven by a desire to get the meaningful use for the clients here in the U.S. and the market in U.S. and we expect that to continue through the year.",,,,,,
Jamie Stockton,Mike Valentine," Thanks for taking my questions and good quarter. Mike, really I would say both of you kind of pertain to where the demand is coming from in the hospital space and then your opportunity in the community hospital space, and the first one is would you say its accurate that the larger the organization the more likely it is that they are moving now relative to the stimulus?"," What I have said in the last couple of calls is the market is been broken down in about third to third to third. The third are waiting to see what meaningful use gets to find us, and if it sums real, a third are staying in course on the journey, they are already started and the third are either starting or accelerating. What I would say that we're seeing now is unless you have some special extenuating circumstances financial or other wise that bottom third that is what was waiting is at a minimum getting a plan to get towards meaningful use. So that I think every, its fair to say unless you get some extenuating circumstances, this is on your radar and you got a plan, and you're building a plan to action it. Where you are in that decision process is a different point but I think it's a very active around getting journey started around meaningful use.",,,,,,
Jamie Stockton,Mike Valentine," Okay and then with the opportunity in the community hospital space, what sort of a time frame do you think is out there as far as those potential customers making a decision as to whether or not they are going to go with their existing vendor or if they are going to switch?"," I would say that we expect the activity around the stimulus to play out over the course of the next three to five years. So, the acceleration to get there will happen then. For a community hospital I would say, they tend to make decisions in entire time frame as little as 60 to 90 days and as we saw in Q4 we actually see some of either our clients or some folks in the market place really making a gut check around or the solutions or the technologies that they selected, are they going to get them to meaningful use and when they make a decision and it is no we need a new strategy they tend to act very quickly. So, I think we'll see activity on that front in 2010 spike. So, people will make the gut check, make a decision and if the decision is a one that finds some self back in the market place, they tend to go very quickly. So I view it as, this is our one of opportunity from a replacement or displacement standpoint a best window of opportunity as driven by stimulus is going to happen in 2010.",,,,,,
Jamie Stockton,Mike Valentine," Okay. And then my last question is on the physician side. You guys have hired a few more people from a sales standpoint I think in your physician business you have the partnership CDW, how are the conversations gone with the regional extension centers. Do you think that that is going to be another area where you can increase your distribution among physicians' especially smaller practices?"," Absolutely our best means to reach high volume physicians' practices is through our client base. In our client base although the active participants in these are regional extension centers so I think when they announce the 60 or 70 where we will absolutely go, we are part of those functions just as we have sold through our base and allow them to essentially already serve as regional extension centers themselves without having a formal designation.",,,,,,
Corey Tobin,Mike Valentine," Three quick ones here first what would you estimate replacement deals either departmental systems or core impatient systems, represents as a percentage of your total opportunities today?",You are asking a Q4 composition question?,,,,,,
Corey Tobin,Mike Valentine,More asking about you look at the pipeline.," It's a tough question to answer because almost every situation represents a displacement for one and multiple supplier so an easy answer is 90% of the transactions that we do are replacing someone. But a pier a wholesale replacement has been fairly rare to-date. Q4 was obviously a big spike for us relative to single large transaction and a couple of others that are tagged along with it. So we haven't seen that as a huge opportunity for us, but as I mentioned in my comments earlier I think our best window opportunity to go, accelerate and perform on that front is probably 2010.",,,,,,
Corey Tobin,Marc Naughton," Switching to the margin side for a second, now that you have a very nice quarter and congratulations in making the 20% goal and assuming that comes through in 2010 internally as you look out over the next three to five years, what sort of the next step with respect to margins and the next target with respect to margins that you would point us towards?"," I'm kind of giving out of the setting the margin target business for at least one quarter if I can. No. We think 20% is a great target since it was 9% in '03, when we first establish it, but we don't think that's the total reflective of all the leverage that's in the business. So, we're on a very unique situation here, so we're going to do a good job. We think of balancing margin growth was investing as appropriate in the business. We've already made a lot of the investments, so those investments won't have a big impact on margins, but we would like to a steady state environment continue to try to grow margins between 50 to 100 basis points annually, but before at this point kind of say we're focusing on getting the 2010s to a full-year 20% and then we will kind of go from there. We aren't done growing margins.",,,,,,
Corey Tobin,Marc Naughton," Final one if I could. Marc you said during your comments earlier with respect to top line guidance would you say at that this point, you're more comfortable with the guidance that was set out there for 2010 revenue, than perhaps you were coming into 2009 and getting the 2009 revenue target?"," Every time we provide guidance, we're very comfortable with what we provide based on the facts that we know at the time. So I have to kind of save it at least my comfort level, I have to be very comfortable every time we talk. I think clearly the environment of January 2010 and February 2010 versus the same time a year ago feels much better from our standpoint relative to what we think we accomplished. I think I indicated that our plan doesn't assume more going to increase bookings over the prior year number. Stimulus will help us meet that target so its not completely exclusive but if we get some upside on to do this stimulus which is more likely in 2010, certainly then it was in 2009, then I think realistically the guidance is our best view of the year at the time we provide it. So I have to say that every time I provide you guidance, I'm comfortable with it.",,,,,,
George Hill,Marc Naughton," I have a couple of questions Marc, a real quick house keeping questions, you think tax rate is 35% for next year?",Correct.,,,,,,
George Hill,Trace Devanny," Okay, Mike I want to talk for a second about the UHF and tenant (inaudible) but I want to ask how we should think about these ones vis-à-vis. I think about all big contracts like Ascension Health and I remember when you guys first signed Ascension you guys had put a number around it, that looked about a $100 million and if I think about Ascension today, if I am doing my math right, they expect almost the quarter of $1 billion of you guys. Should we think about the large contracts that you guys sign not as terminal value contracts but these are really what it costs to bring the customers kind of up the initial curve and that there will be future spending after that?"," Yes, that's absolutely the way we look at it. We talk about in my comments earlier about the dollars that go back into R&D to create new innovations at the edge and so we were talking a little bit about it and advance the call around the white space and how it's a little bit of a moving target because if you look back a year from today, we really didn't have an IT works client, right. It was something that we were launching and now it represents a sizeable chunk of what happened in Q4. You look back two years from today and we were talking to you about the device connectivity and how meaningful that business is today. So you fast forward two years from today and I think there will be more good things going on in our install base that will go back into those large client transactions and we were doing for a large transaction in the US. We skipped 2008 and so having the two happen in 2009 was a good catch up and we expect that, we look for the larger opportunities or larger transactions and we fully expect to continue to leverage our solutions into beyond that initial point of sale and each one of those opportunities. So the short answer is absolutely yes.",,,,,,
George Hill,Marc Naughton," Second of all, not everybody in the healthcare technology sector has reported results as good as your guys are, even an outlook as optimistic as your guys in the most recent quarter. Do you think it's fair to say that they were starting to see the bifurcation of some of the winners and losers in the market?"," I think clearly so competitive environment out there. Right now everybody can say that they are going to meet meaningful used targets and I think those that can prove it early are going to have an advantage and we forcefully have to be in that camp so, we'll see. Clearly our results do set us apart from the rest of the industry at this point.",,,,,,
George Hill,Marc Naughton," And also last question, Marc could you indulge me for just a few seconds, if I remember, when you guys first started on the data center projects four or five years ago, you invested about $100 million in the data center capacity that you have right now. Can you talk about what the managed services attached rate looks like? Maybe give us some color on where the hosted services, revenue line ended the year and what the profitability level there looks like?"," Well, the top line of answer is about $250 million for the year. It clearly is one of our fastest growing elements of the business and the way we have set up our facilities is that we can incrementally add data center space in kind of digestible CapEx chunks. So when we talk about kind of spending the $130 million to $150 million in year in CapEx that covers kind of building out that additional capacity as well as putting computers in and adding people. So it is a business, we would continue to expect to grow. Our ultimate goal is every client is every client we have is managed service clients and then that client steps up and becomes an IT works client a little bit down the road.",,,,,,
George Hill,Mike Valentine," And I guess some roughly I'm thinking about is if you guys, let's say you put a $150 million of worth of capital under this business, it's now a $250 million plus run rate business. It's generating maybe EBIT margins approaching 20%, some of the returns on capital perspective that probably looks pretty good."," Absolutely, we're excited when that business basically turned to where at cash flows it by itself covers itself capital investment on an annual basis so.",,,,,,
Atif Rahim,Mike Valentine,Thanks and Mike congrats on a great quarter too. Quick question related to prior comments you made. What's the margin profile of the IT Works business? Is it something that's highly intensive in terms of cost upfront and then becomes profit leader or show you things a bit somewhat differently?," Yes, the IT Works business is primarily designed for us to kind of take over operating the client's IT which includes running their data center using their equipment. So, we don't have very much CapEx upfront and the (inaudible) we did are very illustrative of that. We didn't have a big CapEx yet in the front. We're not buying their assets. We are not doing the outsourcing view of the world but we do that. We are taking over their people, but that's an expense that we need to go run their things and we're getting paid for that. So, relative to a margin view, we look at these kind of as it overall transactions so there is a providing operating their systems internally, there is a software component, there is often a managed service component for the Cerner elements of the deal because most of them already have a managed services component. So, all in a (inaudible) that gets us to a margin rate that's pretty close to kind of a hurdle rate which historically has been 20%. Clearly the software component that helps get there but that's part of the overall design of others approach, and as we continue to be able to move them to Cerner solutions off their existing solutions all those support maintenance, they are paying on those other solutions flowing into the Cerner office. So those are higher margin businesses as well. So those will actually start out pretty profitable and they will get more profitable normally overtime.",,,,,,
Atif Rahim,Marc Naughton," Okay and then on the 4Q bookings, Marc you said that even without the visible (inaudible) this quarter, you would have been about $100 million over plan. Could you give us any idea of where that strength is coming from? Is it mainly the community hospital market, or is it just existing customers? Any clarity on that?"," Its all over, I mean from the very biggest deals we signed to the relatively small places that are less than a 100 beds and are signed up for $10 million worth of hosting and software and services. So it's really fairly broad across our spectrum of potential clients.",,,,,,
Atif Rahim,Mike Valentine," And then final question on the professional services side that's lagged somewhat and you are indicating that's going to be up in 2010. Any plans to increase your billable headcount there, and how is that going to that affect the numbers?"," Yes, I think relative to that we've discussed previously that we had a (inaudible) bench in anticipation of some activity. That activity hit Q4 pretty well. So I think we are able to handle that business with existing headcount. We have a approach to that where we can hire kind of well seasoned from an education standpoint, kids off campus, run through a six week course where we basically make them capable of installing our systems in our solution center. So we will look at adding headcount as we go forward, but because of a short timeframe to get them up and billable, we won't have to do that significantly in front of seeming the demand. So we've worked very hard to establish this solution center approach and now it will help us meet the demand on a relatively real-time basis.",,,,,,
Steve Hopper,Mike Valentine," Two questions; one on the contracts that you're signing today, are you doing 60 projects for implementation services?"," Yes we are. 100% of the new business that took place in the US is going through the solution center and that is from an implementation perspective and that's a 60 model. There are some P4 services, things that tend to get hung up at that core arrangement that by and large the implementation is a fixed engagement.",,,,,,
Steve Hopper,Marc Naughton,And how do you price those out to ensure that you're not going to get burned on your cost?," See, we've been kind of installing systems for a long time. The advantage of having a very solid platform of Millennium is, we pretty much know what it takes to implement, and especially when they come to the solution center, we're doing a bigger percentage of the bill relative to the client. We have more control over it, and we've actually have a very good history of being [asked to table] to estimate our cost on those implementation, certainly as compared with the field. So all-in-all we much rather run things to solution center and the reality is, that because of the efficiencies of [our field] not traveling even with lower billable rates, we actually can drive a higher margin with those people that we wouldn't [field] people.",,,,,,
Steve Hopper,Marc Naughton," And so is the fixed fee, is that turning out to be a competitive advantage for you?",Yes.,,,,,,
Steve Hopper,Mike Valentine," And one quick house keeping, the number of financing deals or the value of the financing deals were pretty small this quarter. Any color on that?"," We ran out of room in our bank accounts for cash so, not it kind of indicates it's a little bit reflective of the health care entities that we are dealing with this quarter, that more of them were looking to push cash forward and did not need to access the financing capability we offer. So, little bit of a stating the health of those clients…",,,,,,
Steve Hopper,Mike Valentine," And your financing partners are still in place, improving, willing to lend more?"," Yes, given the increasing financial health, they are begging for more business and so obviously if there is interest on the client side, we have people who ready to take that. We'll take one more question.",,,,,,
Sean Wieland,Marc Naughton," So, given the comments around the stimulus and the guidance, you're saying that there is no impact in the stimulus baked into the guidance?"," Sean, let me just clarify that there is, clearly we are doing our normal, we're not assuming any increase in bookings from '09 to 2010. There are probably with some of those bookings would have some stimulus element to them, just in normal course. What I'm really saying is there is nothing extraordinary. We are not including any of these deals that Mike talked about, hoping we were going to come up on the radar and do a transaction in a fairly short period of time. We have looked at our pipelines, there are elements in our pipeline that have some stimulus impact, but we aren't betting ahead of seeing that business coming to our platform. So I just want clarify that to make sure I am not saying we assume no stimulus, the normal amount of activity that doesn't exceed '09 bookings may have a stimulus component, but we think there is opportunity to increase that in 2010.",,,,,,
Sean Wieland,Mike Valentine," So with that color, what do you need to see in terms of the macro landscape to start baking in an inflection point if one is out there?"," We have always indicated Sean that kind of mid 2010, is when we start thinking the stimulus impact we're really going to see it. We had a little preview of it in Q4. Our Q1 guidance is a little bit normal seasonality, so I think as we come out of Q1 and have the 90 better view from our foresting process for the rest of the year, you'll be able to see it as in our bookings statements, it is our best view.",,,,,,
