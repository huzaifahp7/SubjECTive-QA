afternoon. And welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, and other matters that are based on the company’s current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today’s press release and the company’s fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Barbara Rentler:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O’Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter after which we will be happy to respond to any questions you have. As noted in today’s press release, we are very pleased with our better than expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter, as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offered throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million, compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. Sales to the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan growing 55 basis points to 12.6% driven mainly by higher merchandise margin. For the first nine months of fiscal 2016 earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015. dd’s DISCOUNTS continued a year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period, while shoes was the best performing category at Ross. Our ladies’ apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 45%, compared to 48% at this time last year. As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening program during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and nine dd’s DISCOUNTS. We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd’s DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Thank you, Barbara. Let’s start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable stores sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20-basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points, as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other non-recurring costs. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares, for an aggregate price of $530 million. We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. Let’s turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. Operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year’s fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million, our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37% and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $392 million. Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12%, to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I’ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Barbara Rentler:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Thank you, Michael. Again, we are very happy with our third quarter sales and earnings that were well ahead of our expectations. As Michael just mentioned, we base our most challenging multiyear comparisons this holiday season. There is an ongoing uncertainty in the macro economic, political and retail environments that could once again lead to a very promotional fourth quarter. Despite these potential headwinds, we believe we are competitively positioned for the fourth quarter as our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today’s value driven holiday shoppers. To sum up, we see consumers increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This along with a solid execution of our short and long-term strategies makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings. At this point, we’d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-indigo-200" style="flex-basis:0px;">Operator:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Paul Lejuez:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Hey.

Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the drivers in D&amp;A. I think that you mentioned some non-recurring costs that happened in SG&amp;A in the quarter, but also some timing benefits that happened in the third quarter. So could you just add a little more color there?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Sure. So I’ll break the timing in the quarter. The timing in the quarter was actually gross margin component. Packaway ended a little higher than we had in our current original expectations when we ended the quarter. So that timing moved from Q3 to Q4, which is why the Q4 guidance came down by about a penny. In terms of G&amp;A, we ended 5 basis points better. We would have expected more leverage on the 7% comp. That was driven by higher wage, and as we mentioned on the call, one-time non-recurring expenses.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Lindsay Drucker-Mann:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Okay. And your inventories per store were actually down despite a really strong comp. I was wondering if you could talk about, we’ve seen inventories down significantly at a number of department stores. How would you characterize the buying environment or the availability of product and also the driver of your own inventory reductions per store with the strong comp?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael O’Sullivan:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Lindsay, I’ll separate that into two pieces. First of all, just the availability, I’ll let Barbara comment on that in a moment. But in terms of the inventory in our stores, that’s driven by our own plans. We tend to plan our inventories with some discipline, just to make sure that we can drive turns if the sales trend is strong. So, even though, yeah, obviously, our sales trend was very strong in Q3, we kept our inventories in line as we go into Q4. I’ll let Barbara comment in terms of the availability of merchandise.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Barbara Rentler:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">In terms of availability, it’s pretty broad-based and spread through all the markets. There’s been obviously a lot of availability, despite the fact that department stores have kept their inventory basis in line. There is definitely more goods out in market at this moment.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Lindsay Drucker-Mann:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Thanks very much.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-indigo-200" style="flex-basis:0px;">Operator:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Your next is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Adrienne Yih Tennant:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Good afternoon and congratulations. My question was on the resolution of the spring product issue. It seems like that’s clearly behind. But I was wondering if there was any impact whatsoever into the third quarter. And then how much chase or open-to-buy do you actually still have available to get to a higher comp similar to what you did in the third quarter? Thank you.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Barbara Rentler:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">In terms of impact of spring product, just to clarify the spring product going into the third quarter?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Adrienne Yih Tennant:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Sorry.

So in terms of major processing facilities, major distribution centers, just as a reminder, we added a new distribution center last year, that was in 2015 and we had added one before that in 2014, so some pretty lumpy investments that we have now worked our way through. Given our current growth projections, we would expect that we would need additional major distribution capacity, probably, in about four years or five years from now. And if you back off that you’d probably start some of the capital spending a year or two year before that. So it’s going to be a while before we have those kind of lumpy investments again.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Omar Saad:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Okay.

I mean, I would say that, we feel pretty good about our ability to offset the wage increases that we have absorbed in the last couple of years.

Let me just ask you the department stores have come up a few times, if it seems like their strategy has been to reduce their inventories to try and lower their markdown cadence. If they are successful and you guys wake up tomorrow and see the department stores kind of leading their industry to higher AURs? What -- how do you strategically think about that? Does that bring an AUR opportunity for you or do you guys typically look for opportunities to gather market shares in that situation?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael O’Sullivan:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">I would say, we would welcome that, I think, if they got less promotional, we would see that as an opportunity to gain more share and to drive sales. Specifically for us, it would be about sales rather than margin. But I think as Barbara said in her remarks, the indicators that we see support us to think that the fourth quarter will likely be very promotional and so those indicators include the fact that we are seeing plenty of merchandise supply, presumably that supply was made for someone. Secondly, when we look at Q3 results that have been reported so far, they look relatively weak across the retail sector. And then, thirdly, as Barbara said in her remarks, the political and economic environment looks uncertain. So if you mix all those together it suggests that the environment is likely to remain promotional rather than the other way around.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Binetti:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">And then, if I guess, may be continue on that, I feel like there’s not a week that goes by that we don’t hear another one of a department store brand companies updating their strategy to include significantly lower inventory buys going forward. So maybe a soft inventory out there today, but in general, the off price channels continue to comment that inventory in the marketplace remains robust. You guys have certainly benefited from better inventory turns but better merchandise margins over time. If the brands do follow through with that strategy and take inventory lower, it becomes a bit counterintuitive for us to keep hearing off price industry in general, to say that, we still see plentiful inventory out there. How do you think forward to if inventories do get a little bit harder to come by, how you look at approaching your business for next year? Thanks.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael O’Sullivan:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">So, those are good questions. I think, it all depends on what sales those departments stores are able to do and the comparison between those sales and the inventories that they have -- they bought themselves into.

I wanted to ask again about your expectations for Q4, because the comp guidance you’ve given does look a very conservative, given what you just put up in Q3. Would your expectation be in Q4 to continue to gain share within apparel? Is it conservative on apparel just generally and on retail generally or is there something that gives you pause about your own performance?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">I think it’s nothing specific to us, Lorraine. I think, it’s more about the external environment and really the things that Barbara has mentioned that the broader political and economic environment looks uncertain. The Q3, the third quarter results that have been reported so far look relatively weak and that suggests that it could get pretty promotional as retailers try to either hold on to or avoid losing share. So the combination of those two things makes us relatively concerned about the external environment. The only thing that’s specific to us, I suppose, is the fact that we are up against our toughest year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter on a two-year and three-year basis. So that’s the other thing that sort of factors into our guidance.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Laura Champine:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Got it.

Congrats on best comps in retail. Regarding the comps and traffic gains, what was happening with traffic with respect to how they were -- it was so impressive? Were you able to chase into categories and did you have to delay shipments in terms of some of the seasonal weather? Just curious about how that traffic number was so impressive. A related question is just on the merchandise margins. Is that attributable to the strong inventory control? Thanks.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Oliver, I will start with the merchant margins. We obviously outperformed the high end of our comp sales targets, so that meant we had faster turns resulting in markdown leverage. We also benefited from our ability to take advantages of buying opportunities in the marketplace. So, both of those factors contributed to the higher merchandise margin.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Barbara Rentler:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">And in terms of chasing into categories, again there’s been a lot of availability in the marketplace. So the merchants are out in market every day, looking for opportunities, so they’ve been able to chase into categories that we are selling. In terms of seasonal products, we had relatively conservative seasonal plans for the Q3 and so seasonal performance has been overall fine at this point in time and the categories go-forward remain to be seen what we find out in the marketplace as we chase our way across.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Oliver Chen:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Thanks so much.

Congrats on a nice quarter. So, just on the 7% comp was performance pretty consistent throughout the quarter.

Thank you so much. Michael, I wanted to just ask about wage inflation and SG&amp;A leverage. It seems like the leverage point today, perhaps, starting in the third quarter, sits a little bit higher because of the wage increases. So I’m wondering if you can just talk to your -- what comp you need to leverage SG&amp;A in a normal environment? And it seems like starting in the third quarter and continuing maybe through the first half of ‘17 that comp needed is a bit higher because of the incremental wages, could you just talk us through that?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Sure, Kimberly. The third quarter levered by 5 basis points on the 7% comp. As we mentioned in our comments, that was partly driven by wages and that really hasn’t changed from the first part of the year but it was also impacted by one-time non-recurring charges we took in the quarter. So I’d say the leverage point change in the quarter was those non-recurring costs. At this point, we continue to believe, at least in the next couple of years that the leverage point continues to be about 3%.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Kimberly Greenberger:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">About 3%, okay, great. And I’m wondering if there was any year-over-year increase in incentive compensation either driving that 20 basis points of gross margin deleverage or in your SG&amp;A. And then lastly, Barbara, I apologize if I didn’t hear this directly, but could you just comment on the apparel execution in the women’s business? I think on the August earnings call you had mentioned, you’ve made a great deal of progress in the second quarter, but you weren’t entirely happy yet. I’m just wondering if you can just update us on the progress there.

So, it’s month-to-month improving business by business, but we do feel like we’ve made progress and we do feel like we’re on track as long as we continue to execute appropriately.</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Kimberly Greenberger:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Terrific.

And then, the second question would be, I know it’s early and a lot of subjecting this to this, but if tax -- corporate tax rates were to be reduced, could you maybe just help us think about how to think about the possible uses of cash in a scenario where additional cash became available in size for you?</dd></li><li class="b-list-item border-b border-indigo-400 border-opacity-50 py-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row"><dt class="md:min-w-xs md:max-w-xs mr-4 md:text-right text-lg md:text-base font-bold text-yellow-400" style="flex-basis:0px;">Michael Hartshorn:</dt> <dd class="flex-auto">Sure.

There might be some incremental opportunity in both of those areas, but it will be relatively small.

And welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, and other matters that are based on the company’s current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today’s press release and the company’s fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O’Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter after which we will be happy to respond to any questions you have. As noted in today’s press release, we are very pleased with our better than expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter, as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offered throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million, compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. Sales to the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan growing 55 basis points to 12.6% driven mainly by higher merchandise margin. For the first nine months of fiscal 2016 earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015. dd’s DISCOUNTS continued a year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period, while shoes was the best performing category at Ross. Our ladies’ apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 45%, compared to 48% at this time last year. As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening program during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and nine dd’s DISCOUNTS. We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd’s DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year. Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.\nMichael Hartshorn: Thank you, Barbara. Let’s start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable stores sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20-basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points, as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other non-recurring costs. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares, for an aggregate price of $530 million. We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015. Let’s turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year. The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. Operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year’s fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million, our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37% and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $392 million. Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12%, to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015. Now I’ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Michael. Again, we are very happy with our third quarter sales and earnings that were well ahead of our expectations. As Michael just mentioned, we base our most challenging multiyear comparisons this holiday season. There is an ongoing uncertainty in the macro economic, political and retail environments that could once again lead to a very promotional fourth quarter. Despite these potential headwinds, we believe we are competitively positioned for the fourth quarter as our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today’s value driven holiday shoppers. To sum up, we see consumers increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This along with a solid execution of our short and long-term strategies makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings. At this point, we’d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you remind us of what your merchandise margin typically looks like on packaway merchandise compared to your normal in-season buys and has there been anything in the quality of packaway as you have seen over the past few quarters that’s changed that relationship at all?\nMichael Hartshorn: From a margin perspective, Paul, the margin on packaway is very similar to [inaudible] merchandise or direct store merchandise. To us it’s the best value for the customer.\nMichael O’Sullivan: And it has been consistent…\nPaul Lejuez: Has been consistent?\nMichael O’Sullivan: Yes. It’s been consistent over time, Paul. So, no real change over the past several quarters.\nPaul Lejuez: Gotcha. Thanks. And just one follow-up, it looks like D&A growth slowed substantially, can you talk about what maybe going on on that line?\nMichael Hartshorn: So on G&A, we obviously had a seven comp. We were 5 basis points lower, partly driven by…\nPaul Lejuez: D&A, I’m sorry, Michael. I was asking about the D&A.\nMichael Hartshorn: Yeah. Sorry, obviously, G&A. So, on capital spending, we are forecasting for the year about $315 million in capital, which is lower than we projected at the beginning of the year due to delay in some corporate office and supply chain projects that we expect to push into next year.\nPaul Lejuez: Any initial thoughts on the CapEx budget for next year?\nMichael Hartshorn: Expectation at this point would be around $400 million similar to how we started this year.\nPaul Lejuez: Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: The next question is from Lindsay Drucker-Mann from Goldman Sachs.\nLindsay Drucker-Mann: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the drivers in D&A. I think that you mentioned some non-recurring costs that happened in SG&A in the quarter, but also some timing benefits that happened in the third quarter. So could you just add a little more color there?\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. So I’ll break the timing in the quarter. The timing in the quarter was actually gross margin component. Packaway ended a little higher than we had in our current original expectations when we ended the quarter. So that timing moved from Q3 to Q4, which is why the Q4 guidance came down by about a penny. In terms of G&A, we ended 5 basis points better. We would have expected more leverage on the 7% comp. That was driven by higher wage, and as we mentioned on the call, one-time non-recurring expenses.\nLindsay Drucker-Mann: Okay. And your inventories per store were actually down despite a really strong comp. I was wondering if you could talk about, we’ve seen inventories down significantly at a number of department stores. How would you characterize the buying environment or the availability of product and also the driver of your own inventory reductions per store with the strong comp?\nMichael O’Sullivan: Lindsay, I’ll separate that into two pieces. First of all, just the availability, I’ll let Barbara comment on that in a moment. But in terms of the inventory in our stores, that’s driven by our own plans. We tend to plan our inventories with some discipline, just to make sure that we can drive turns if the sales trend is strong. So, even though, yeah, obviously, our sales trend was very strong in Q3, we kept our inventories in line as we go into Q4. I’ll let Barbara comment in terms of the availability of merchandise.\nBarbara Rentler: In terms of availability, it’s pretty broad-based and spread through all the markets. There’s been obviously a lot of availability, despite the fact that department stores have kept their inventory basis in line. There is definitely more goods out in market at this moment.\nLindsay Drucker-Mann: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Good afternoon and congratulations. My question was on the resolution of the spring product issue. It seems like that’s clearly behind. But I was wondering if there was any impact whatsoever into the third quarter. And then how much chase or open-to-buy do you actually still have available to get to a higher comp similar to what you did in the third quarter? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: In terms of impact of spring product, just to clarify the spring product going into the third quarter?\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Sorry. The spring product issue that was from Q1 on...\nBarbara Rentler: Just the issue itself, a hangover effect, we did not have a hangover effect…\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Yeah. The hangover, exactly.\nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Okay. So we did not have a hangover effect in terms of product moving into the third quarter, and can you just clarify the second piece of question again?\nMichael Hartshorn: I think on the second piece, just, I think, I’d just answer that already. We -- our business is all about chasing sales trends. So, I’ll remind you, coming into Q3 our guidance was a 1 to 2 comp in Q3 and we were able to chase it up to a 7%. So we’ve been pretty good about our ability to go out…\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Got it.\nMichael Hartshorn: …and get merchandise in Q4 if the sales trend is there.\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Okay. And then can you [inaudible] about over levering to some of the upside inventory that was out there? Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sorry, Adrienne, you were cutting out there. Could you just repeat the questions?\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Oh, I’m sorry. Just on the packaway opportunity that you have, how opportunistic was the buying last year in terms of, perhaps, any margin upside, does that make sense? So, to the extent that you were able to buy at better than historic pricing, averaging unit cost.\nMichael Hartshorn: Yeah. I think we wouldn’t expect to see a lot of margin expansion from that. What we have done is, to the extent we are able to buy great product opportunistically and put it into the hotel, put it into packaway, when we flow it out, what we’re really doing is trying to drive sales. So that’s really where we look for those bargains to really drive sales rather than add to our margin.\nAdrienne Yih Tennant: Okay. Thank you very much. Best of luck. Great job.\nOperator: Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.\nOmar Saad: Thank you. Great quarter. I wanted to ask if you could talk about how much scale the current supply chain, the distribution centers, infrastructure you have, how much they can handle and when do you expect as we think out over time, the next kind of major round of investments in IT and supply chain?\nMichael O’Sullivan: Sure. So in terms of major processing facilities, major distribution centers, just as a reminder, we added a new distribution center last year, that was in 2015 and we had added one before that in 2014, so some pretty lumpy investments that we have now worked our way through. Given our current growth projections, we would expect that we would need additional major distribution capacity, probably, in about four years or five years from now. And if you back off that you’d probably start some of the capital spending a year or two year before that. So it’s going to be a while before we have those kind of lumpy investments again.\nOmar Saad: Okay. If I could have one follow-up, in terms of the great comp number you put up this quarter, do you think about the upside, perhaps, where your expectations were three months or six months ago, is more of the upside coming from the packaway product or the regular flow?\nMichael O’Sullivan: It’s a combination. I wouldn’t call out one or the other. The truth is, the upside really comes from the customer coming in and buying more product and we’ve been able to get great packaway product and great flow product in order to fuel that sales trend.\nBarbara Rentler: So the merchants are chasing the sales trend as we go.\nOmar Saad: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, everybody. Congratulations. Fantastic quarter. So I was curious if there were any segments in the quarter that surprised you either to the upside or to the downside, be it home, personal care, juniors, other than I believe you called out footwear, any other call outs?\nBarbara Rentler: I wouldn’t say that that surprised us. Our home business continues to perform well. Shoes have been performing well all along and we felt good about our assortments in ladies as we were starting to move and improve the assortments. So we did -- we were happy with that performance. I guess that would be -- if anything that would be the surprise is that business has been moving from quarter-to-quarter in the right direction. But, overall, I wouldn’t say major surprises, because home and shoes have continued and have been overall good all the year.\nMarni Shapiro: And within ladies, was it active wear, was it juniors, was it across the board?\nBarbara Rentler: In ladies, well, active wear -- active wear is performing just fine. I would say it’s really more in ladies and juniors would be at this moment in time.\nMarni Shapiro: Excellent. Best of luck for the holiday season, guys.\nBarbara Rentler: Thanks.\nMichael O’Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the increase in basket size that you commented on in the prepared remarks, what was the driver of that? Was that a unit or a pricing increase?\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this 7% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the basket size. Traffic was slightly larger increase than basket. The basket was all driven by higher units per transaction, AUR was relatively flat.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Okay. And what do you expect for AUR trends going forward?\nMichael Hartshorn: I don’t think we comment at this point, but it’s run relatively flat all year round for us.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.\nBrian Tunick: Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious, I guess, for Barbara, may be, can you talk about what categories might be the biggest opportunity you see for next year or may be where some of your buying team is spending their time? And then, I guess, also curious on the real estate pipeline, any initial thoughts from a planning perspective, why either the store growth rate or mix could look different than what we saw this year? Thanks very much.\nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of categories for next year, we still feel very good about our home business. We feel there’s a lot of opportunity that goes on and home, it’s very broad based. If we continued to execute our strategies effectively in ladies, we would be feeling positive about our ladies business as long as we stay on track and execute appropriately. And in terms of where the merchants are spending their time, all the merchants are spending their time in the market, not just home merchants, not just in specific areas that we think we would expand for next year, all merchants are spending their time in markets again because there are so much availability and potential opportunities.\nMichael O’Sullivan: And Brian, on your question about real estate and number of stores, obviously, we will be more specific when we talk about 2017 guidance in February. But, I think, it’s a fair bet, if you look at our store openings over the past several years, we run at typically 80 to 90 net new stores a year. I wouldn’t expect a dramatic deviation from that going forward.\nBrian Tunick: And if I could throw in one more question, obviously, you guys have talked about wage pressure now and some of the things you are doing to absorb it? But are there other additional opportunities, both in the supply chain, on the store side that you guys are finding to offset the wage pressure?\nMichael O’Sullivan: There always are. I mean, as a company, we go through a rigorous and detailed budget process. There’s a lot of sort of expense discipline within different functions within the company. So we’re always looking for new opportunities to find efficiency and drive savings. And again, we will talk more about that when we give 2017 guidance. I mean, I would say that, we feel pretty good about our ability to offset the wage increases that we have absorbed in the last couple of years. There’s a limit to the degree to which we can offset those increases going forward.\nBrian Tunick: All right. Super. Good luck this holiday.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS securities.\nMichael Binetti: Guys, good afternoon, and congrats -- my congrats on a nice quarter. Let me just ask you the department stores have come up a few times, if it seems like their strategy has been to reduce their inventories to try and lower their markdown cadence. If they are successful and you guys wake up tomorrow and see the department stores kind of leading their industry to higher AURs? What -- how do you strategically think about that? Does that bring an AUR opportunity for you or do you guys typically look for opportunities to gather market shares in that situation?\nMichael O’Sullivan: I would say, we would welcome that, I think, if they got less promotional, we would see that as an opportunity to gain more share and to drive sales. Specifically for us, it would be about sales rather than margin. But I think as Barbara said in her remarks, the indicators that we see support us to think that the fourth quarter will likely be very promotional and so those indicators include the fact that we are seeing plenty of merchandise supply, presumably that supply was made for someone. Secondly, when we look at Q3 results that have been reported so far, they look relatively weak across the retail sector. And then, thirdly, as Barbara said in her remarks, the political and economic environment looks uncertain. So if you mix all those together it suggests that the environment is likely to remain promotional rather than the other way around.\nMichael Binetti: And then, if I guess, may be continue on that, I feel like there’s not a week that goes by that we don’t hear another one of a department store brand companies updating their strategy to include significantly lower inventory buys going forward. So maybe a soft inventory out there today, but in general, the off price channels continue to comment that inventory in the marketplace remains robust. You guys have certainly benefited from better inventory turns but better merchandise margins over time. If the brands do follow through with that strategy and take inventory lower, it becomes a bit counterintuitive for us to keep hearing off price industry in general, to say that, we still see plentiful inventory out there. How do you think forward to if inventories do get a little bit harder to come by, how you look at approaching your business for next year? Thanks.\nMichael O’Sullivan: So, those are good questions. I think, it all depends on what sales those departments stores are able to do and the comparison between those sales and the inventories that they have -- they bought themselves into. I mean, right now, as I say, based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace, we see no problem with the buy.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.\nLaura Champine: Good afternoon. I wanted to ask again about your expectations for Q4, because the comp guidance you’ve given does look a very conservative, given what you just put up in Q3. Would your expectation be in Q4 to continue to gain share within apparel? Is it conservative on apparel just generally and on retail generally or is there something that gives you pause about your own performance?\nMichael Hartshorn: I think it’s nothing specific to us, Lorraine. I think, it’s more about the external environment and really the things that Barbara has mentioned that the broader political and economic environment looks uncertain. The Q3, the third quarter results that have been reported so far look relatively weak and that suggests that it could get pretty promotional as retailers try to either hold on to or avoid losing share. So the combination of those two things makes us relatively concerned about the external environment. The only thing that’s specific to us, I suppose, is the fact that we are up against our toughest year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter on a two-year and three-year basis. So that’s the other thing that sort of factors into our guidance.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.\nOliver Chen: Hi. Congrats on best comps in retail. Regarding the comps and traffic gains, what was happening with traffic with respect to how they were -- it was so impressive? Were you able to chase into categories and did you have to delay shipments in terms of some of the seasonal weather? Just curious about how that traffic number was so impressive. A related question is just on the merchandise margins. Is that attributable to the strong inventory control? Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: Oliver, I will start with the merchant margins. We obviously outperformed the high end of our comp sales targets, so that meant we had faster turns resulting in markdown leverage. We also benefited from our ability to take advantages of buying opportunities in the marketplace. So, both of those factors contributed to the higher merchandise margin.\nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of chasing into categories, again there’s been a lot of availability in the marketplace. So the merchants are out in market every day, looking for opportunities, so they’ve been able to chase into categories that we are selling. In terms of seasonal products, we had relatively conservative seasonal plans for the Q3 and so seasonal performance has been overall fine at this point in time and the categories go-forward remain to be seen what we find out in the marketplace as we chase our way across.\nOliver Chen: Thanks so much. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, just on the 7% comp was performance pretty consistent throughout the quarter. And then just as you dig into the performance versus the choppy macro backdrop that you call out, are you seeing a broadening of the customer base, new customers shopping the store, just the best way that you track it, I’m curious what you are seeing?\nMichael Hartshorn: In terms of trends during the quarter, Matthew, the comps were similar across all three months in the quarter.\nMichael O’Sullivan: And then what’s driving that 7% comp, it’s hard for us to tell, Matthew, but it’s almost certainly a combination of certainly some new customers and then some existing customers who are just shopping us more, looking for values and happy with what we’re able to offer them.\nMatthew Boss: Got it. And then just a follow-up on margins for the fourth quarter, what’s the best way to think about recapturing the 100 basis points related to the packaways last year, just curious, how we should think about recapture of that loss from last year?\nMichael Hartshorn: So the guidance assumes some recapture of the 100 basis points. We didn’t -- we don’t -- our practice is not to call out specifically in upcoming guidance, but it’s part of the driver of the EPS growth in the fourth quarter.\nMatthew Boss: Okay. Best of luck.\nOperator: The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you so much. Michael, I wanted to just ask about wage inflation and SG&A leverage. It seems like the leverage point today, perhaps, starting in the third quarter, sits a little bit higher because of the wage increases. So I’m wondering if you can just talk to your -- what comp you need to leverage SG&A in a normal environment? And it seems like starting in the third quarter and continuing maybe through the first half of ‘17 that comp needed is a bit higher because of the incremental wages, could you just talk us through that?\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Kimberly. The third quarter levered by 5 basis points on the 7% comp. As we mentioned in our comments, that was partly driven by wages and that really hasn’t changed from the first part of the year but it was also impacted by one-time non-recurring charges we took in the quarter. So I’d say the leverage point change in the quarter was those non-recurring costs. At this point, we continue to believe, at least in the next couple of years that the leverage point continues to be about 3%.\nKimberly Greenberger: About 3%, okay, great. And I’m wondering if there was any year-over-year increase in incentive compensation either driving that 20 basis points of gross margin deleverage or in your SG&A. And then lastly, Barbara, I apologize if I didn’t hear this directly, but could you just comment on the apparel execution in the women’s business? I think on the August earnings call you had mentioned, you’ve made a great deal of progress in the second quarter, but you weren’t entirely happy yet. I’m just wondering if you can just update us on the progress there. Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on the incentive costs, yes, on both gross margin and SG&A. In our notes we mentioned that buying expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year and that was mainly from higher incentive costs given the outperformance during the quarter.\nBarbara Rentler: And, Kimberly, in terms of the ladies business, we do feel like we’re making progress. We are moving in the right direction and we are expecting, as long as we execute effectively where we had some real major execution issues in Q1 that we’re going to continue to see it strengthening in the business. So, it’s month-to-month improving business by business, but we do feel like we’ve made progress and we do feel like we’re on track as long as we continue to execute appropriately.\nKimberly Greenberger: Terrific. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hi, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Michael, just a quick one on wages, can you remind us, I’m not sure if you shared this, what kind of EPS headwind, wage inflation has been or do you project will be for you guys this year? And then just, not asking for guidance, but just simplistically when we think about next year, does that headwind, is it similar, does it lessen or does it increase?\nMichael Hartshorn: So, Ike, we obviously haven’t called out the impact of wages, because we’ve been able to offset the impact to date. Obviously, we are working through our finalizing our 2007 (sic) [2017] budget and we’ll be in a better position at the end of the year when we give our guidance for 2017 and the potential impact.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.\nBob Drbul: Hi. Good afternoon. Just have two questions. The first one is, regionally you called out California, I was just wondering if there are any other call outs, specifically the Midwest has been pretty consistent for you guys, how you are doing in the Midwest. And then, the second question would be, I know it’s early and a lot of subjecting this to this, but if tax -- corporate tax rates were to be reduced, could you maybe just help us think about how to think about the possible uses of cash in a scenario where additional cash became available in size for you?\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. So on the regional performance, geographically the strong comp performance was very broad based. We mentioned California, the Midwest also performed very well. On tax policy, I think, it’s really too early to comment on the impact and what policy changes ultimately get implemented.\nBob Drbul: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners.\nRoxanne Meyer: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations on a terrific quarter. I just have a follow-up question on category performance. Obviously, home and shoes were called out as standouts? I’m just wondering if you could also share other categories that were both above and as well as below the chain average. Thanks a lot.\nBarbara Rentler: I would say that other businesses fell pretty much closer in line in apparel. In terms of probably some of our weaker performances, we’re still struggling in accessories as we’re working our straight way through that, but after that, I would say pretty much most of the businesses fell in line.\nRoxanne Meyer: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the results. Any update open dd’s and what you’re seeing there, and how you are thinking about for 2017 and also any update on shrinkage? Thank you.\nMichael O’Sullivan: Dana, on dd’s, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, dd’s continued the strong performance in Q3. The business is on track for another good year. We -- as we have over the last several years, this year we opened about 20 new dd’s stores and again, we will be more specific when we give 2017 guidance, but if I had to speculate, I would say that you could expect that we’re not going to deviate materially from that going forward.\nMichael Hartshorn: On shrink, we finished our physical inventory as we do every year in the third quarter. Shrink results were slightly better than our expectations. That said, shrink was a slight headwind versus last year as we anniversaried better than expected results from the prior year.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks. Good afternoon. Sorry, if I missed it, but just any thoughts on where you’d expect inventory to end the year and then any color on the long-term merchant mark-- merch mark opportunity from here? Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: In terms of inventory for the year, I mean, I think, we’ll continue to operate the business at slightly down and I don’t think that our expectation would change for year-end inventories.\nMichael O’Sullivan: And then in terms of longer-term margin opportunity, at this point, it’s really about the sales line. I kind of feel like in terms of the things that have driven our margin improvement over the last several years, those things have included tighter inventory control, which has obviously driven lower markdowns and improved shortage control. There might be some incremental opportunity in both of those areas, but it will be relatively small. So the real upside opportunity on margin is going to come from ahead of planned sales.\nSimeon Siegel: Great. Thanks. Best of luck for holiday.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call.
